You know I am standing right here in the room.
I heard Karposev speaking about the sale of the oil.
It is going to be done on a secure satellite link.
All of the buyers are using anonymous representatives, who will be put in separate rooms of the same large building.
What building?
I don't know.
But if we find the buyers, we follow the buyers to the building.
NELL:
Hetty, I just I.D.'d the man Kensi and Deeks shot.
His name is Eliot Asadi, and he was recently in Raqqa, Syria.
HETTY:
Don't tell me.
The CIA thinks that he's been training in Raqqa.
Hetty, he's a member of ISIS.
Whether Karposev knew it or not, he was working for ISIS.
There's no way ISIS was gonna cut him in on the profits.
Okay, so they send a hit squad after Karposev but Anna beats them to it and kills him.
Look, however it played out, Ivan is dead.
ISIS has control of that oil.
HETTY:
And they're about to expand their war chest by $80 million.
Hey.
Check it out.
I was able to configure the Kremlin's CCTV feed to run through our facial rec software.
NELL:
Nice work, Beale.
I've located the first group of oil buyers from the list Pavel gave us-
- Chinese.
They're on the move in the Red Square area.
Hey, what about the group from Cameroon?
Uh, just arrived at Sheremetyevo.
All right.
Pass the info to Kensi and Deeks, and I'll let Hetty know.
Copy that.
Trust her?
No.
But we know who all the buyers are.
If they all show up at the same spot, her story starts to check out.
(door opens)
Let me guess.
You don't trust me.
Good instincts.
But you need me.
"Need" is a strong word.
If I play nice, Hetty agreed to help me find a job in the States.
What happened to your whole "army of one" thing?
Just a walkabout.
An experiment.
Maybe we all do better as part of a tribe.
Tribes operate on trust.
You came here with Arkady.
Ever stop to think that it's me who doesn't trust you?
HETTY:
Mr. Callen!
Mr. Hanna!
GRANGER:
You and Arkady should go to the hotel, get Beale hooked into their surveillance system.
What hotel?
NELL:
The buyers from China just arrived at the Red Street Hotel.
G and I can hit the hotel.
GRANGER:
I need you to meet up with Kensi and Deeks.
They're gonna divert the Cameroon buyers while the three of you go into the hotel posing as the party from Cameroon.
CALLEN:
The three of us?
You, Sam and Anna.
Hey.
So, the representative of the buyer is Brice Nimbani.
He, along with his girlfriend and bodyguard, just arrived at Sheremetyevo Airport.
SAM:
Really?
CALLEN:
This might be a stretch.
NELL:
We're relying on the intel that we have.
The buyers' representatives are not known by the sellers.
I'm not gonna lie to you and say it's great, but it's the best play we have.
And that's happening today?
Well, that's very interesting, Eric.
Thank you.
(laughs)
What is funny?
Oh, nothing.
Um,
I just figured out how we're going to get access to the back.
Deeks and I are in position.
He does this, Arkady.
Pops into my life, blows it up and leaves.
It's not our business.
I'm not a crazy person.
That's good to know.
(phone chimes)
Hey.
We should check out that back room.
It's a closed loop, Eric.
Information flows to me.
Got it.
What?
You're using Eric's access to the Kremlin's system to dig up information about your father?
Look, Sam...
G, I'm not judging.
I get it, but...
if he sets off a red flag, it'll make our stay in Russia a little uncomfortable.
He had to have escaped during transport to the Gulag.
That's why there's no record of his death.
He escaped, he took a new name, he was home free.
He could've lived the rest of his life in peace on the beach, in the south of France.
He didn't leave.
Yeah, he made sure that other people had a chance to escape also.
He was a good man.
Yeah, well, maybe he still is a good man.
There's nothing to say that he's dead.
G...
There's nothing to say he's still alive, either.
¶ ¶
Hey!
Cameroon buyers are secured.
So Eric designed a Trojan horse virus to give us the physical location of the sellers.
And if they didn't firewall properly, we could also locate the three ships carrying the oil.
Sounds easy enough.
Eh, anything but.
The buyers' terminals aren't networked.
Data's sent via sat phone interface.
And for the virus to work, it's got to be placed at all five buyers' terminals using these... (clears throat)
USB drives.
And each one of those five terminals will be in a separate room of the hotel.
Exactly.
Wow.
Cakewalk.
Oh, it gets better.
In order for the virus to give us the physical location of the sellers, it must crash the auction.
And when that happens...
When that happens, the sellers run.
We lose them, we lose the oil.
ISIS will not resurface for the sale.
They may blow up the oil in a port city to make a statement.
Well, let's hope that Hetty can get Eric access to the hotel's surveillance cams.
Yeah, we're gonna need eyes in the sky on this one.
What am I doing here?
No...
Singing?
I don't sing.
From your diaphragm, Arkady.
Diaphragma.
Huh?
(barks softly)
(technicians conversing indistinctly)
¶ ¶
(whispers):
Are we good, Eric?
I have a signal.
One moment.
All right, I'm in.
I have full access to the hotel's security cameras.
(French accent):
Mr. Bukin.
Yes.
I was told to tell you that your friends in Cameroon appreciate any hospitality that you could show us.
We expected you earlier.
We're here now.
Hm.
Of course you are.
I've taken the liberty of putting you in Room 201.
Merci.
Derien.
Let's see how many thugs each buyer sent.
NELL:
Good idea.
then I'll track 'em and see which rooms they went into.
Got 'em.
Keep an eye out for the next set of buyers.
Yeah.
They're in room 318.
All right... we've got four minutes until the computer's live for the auction.
Auction begins, I insert the USB drive and download the virus.
Place a bid and 60 seconds later, the jig is up.
I walk away.
That's about it.
Trust is based on actions, not words.
Nothing I can say to make you think different than you do.
You'll be able to hear and talk with the rest of the team.
NELL:
Okay guys, I've got the first set of rooms.
Room 318 and 401.
Good luck.
Callen, looks like the safest way to breach 318 is gonna be through the balcony, and room 320 is being cleaned, so you can enter through there.
CALLEN:
Copy.
Okay, Sam, room 401-- it's a suite and it's isolated.
Best bet is shock and awe straight through the front door.
SAM:
I got it, Nell.
Moving now.
Okay, talk to me, Eric.
There it is.
Third room is 120.
Kensi, take 120.
It's a courtyard room with an exterior door.
KENSI:
Copy that.
Fourth room, here we go-- 215.
Deeks, you're up.
Room 215.
It's a corner suite.
You're gonna want to come at it from the third floor.
There's a window directly over 215's balcony.
DEEKS:
On my way.
NELL:
All right.
The goal for the next two minutes is to stay under the radar.
Gunfire is our last resort.
(grunts)
The team is in position.
Go.
(grunting)
Aah!
(man speaks Russian)
Aah!
(grunting)
(groans)
Oh!
(man groans)
(grunting)
(moans)
All the drives are placed.
Virus downloading.
NELL:
Good.
(singing in Russian)
(groaning quietly)
Time to go.
Thank you.
And thank you.
50 seconds until the sellers know we're here.
Thanks.
Just amp up the pressure.
Sorry.
Just updating the team.
The virus is working, it's narrowing the field.
The sellers are on the same block as the hotel.
30 seconds.
Sellers aren't moving.
They're within 100 yards of the hotel.
We need to know the location of the sellers before they know their system's been compromised.
Again-- not helping.
GRANGER:
And get the team out of the hotel.
Standing by for the location.
ERIC:
No, don't do that.
What?
The sellers are inside the hotel.
Room 190.
Guys, room 190.
The sellers' signal's still active.
They're still in the room.
ERIC:
Yeah.
KENSI:
Clear!
Eric, the room's empty.
Talk to me.
Where are they?
Searching now.
Yeah, we don't have a view of their door, but no one came down that hallway to the lobby.
There.
Underground garage.
GRANGER:
We've got three men just entered a black van.
Go, go.
(tires screeching in distance)
KENSI:
Hold your fire!
(grunting)
ARKADY:
Anna!
Clear.
(raspy sigh, quiet groan)
Anna.
HETTY:
How bad?
Took a round in the abdomen.
Two in the right arm.
Losing lots of blood.
The Politsiya are closing in.
I'll carry you.
Let's go.
(sirens wailing in distance) No.
They are almost here.
Leave me.
That's not happening.
Leave me... (panting)
If I am here,
I can stall them.
I can... give you some time.
Go.
(sirens approaching)
We need to move.
No.
I'll stay.
No.
You cannot.
They will have too many questions for you.
Yeah.
Walk away.
All right.
Anna, come on.
Come on.
Please.
Let's go.
¶ ¶
We're still looking, but, uh, Anna's in the wind.
My guess is she's using her own contacts to try and find Arkady.
Arkady is alive.
But he seems to be keeping his mouth shut.
Our names haven't been flagged.
Okay.
Sam and I will stay back.
We'll locate him.
We'll get him out.
We've worn out our welcome here, Mr. Callen.
We're not gonna just leave him here.
Arkady has many friends here.
Friends that profit more when he's not in custody.
(sighs) On a better note...
Eric has the names of the ships carrying the stolen oil.
The Navy is en route to intercept and secure them.
(sighs)
This place is special to you.
I was married here.
What?
!
The... ceremony was here.
To who?
It was all part of a...
an undercover assignment.
(grunts)
And it meant nothing to you.
Nothing.
I know you asked Eric to look into information about your father.
If there's any chance my father's alive then...
But I told Mr. Beale not to look into it, because I wanted to do it.
So, the man whom Arkady dealt with, in Russia, until 1988, is named Konstantin Chernoff.
But there are no records of any man by that name before 1974.
The year Nikita Reznikov was sent to the Gulag.
Yes.
My father escaped, dropped the name Reznikov.
Took the name Chernoff and...
Helped many, many people escape to the West.
He lived in Ruza, about an hour west of here.
"Lived"?
Mr. Callen, your father died in 2008.
He's buried in the little town cemetery at Ruza.
I was here... in Moscow, for-for years, when he was still alive.
(grunts, sighs)
I need to, uh...
Hetty, uh...
Yes, go.
We leave tonight.
¶ ¶
(sighs)
G.
Let's go home.
Yeah.

Eun-joo!
Nanny, is Eun-joo awake?
I told you not to eat the junk food like this.
Do you want to end up being in the hospital?
Company 2!
The leaders ran to the alleys.
I wasn't protesting!
What's with you?
Choi Chil-sung, don't you remember me?
What?
What the hell, you bastards?
!
We just kept the small ones.
Give us a break!
You crooks!
My girl!
Boss, these bastards pocketed all the big ones!
That son of a bitch!
You damn assholes!
It was just a few small ones.
The rich are so greedy.
a KWAK Kyung-taek film
- Good morning, Eun-joo.
- Good morning.
How much in total?
This film is based on true event happened in Pusan 1978.
THE classified file
- What the hell?
- What now?
You'll get 20g gold for being Officer of the Month.
This is it?
Come on, I'm expecting my 5th kid soon.
There you go again!
I'm pinched, that's all I got.
I know you got a big cut from Taechang Rubber!
Come on, pay up.
You'd skin a flea for its hide!
One, two, three.
- Make it five.
- Take three and go.
Damn thief.
Sang-gi...
Make sure he gets a long sentence.
You know what he did to that bus attendant.
Don't worry.
That son of a bitch!
You keep watch.
- Stop, will you?
- Come here, asshole!
JULY 18, 1978 BUSAN HYOSUNG ELEMENTARY
Eun-joo!
Here.
See you!
That's junk food.
- You know them well?
- Yeah.
Sung-han's dad helped my aunt.
Hey kids!
Can you help me with this?
I see, sir.
Don't mention this to anyone else.
And then?
We'll take care of that.
Yes.
What did he say?
In front of the school,
Eun-joo and Min-hye got in the car of a man who was asking for directions.
What?
Oh my...
What happened to Eun-joo?
!
What should we do, sis!
I can't believe it.
If he plans to ask for money, then I think she's safe for now.
Do you happen to have any enemies around you?
It's highly possible that someone you know did this.
This is her room.
People who know you keep cash at home, driver and nanny included,
Sis.
and workers at the fishing company who might have resentments.
We'll investigate, but if we don't get a call in 2-3 days,
Yes, sir.
we need urgently to find a witness, offering a reward if necessary.
I told you everything yesterday!
We just need to check a few more things.
We can't just sit around and wait.
Let's try things our way.
JULY 19 2 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING
There are more than six instances of gold and earth in her fate, which is quite tough for a girl.
I think you should prepare for the worst.
Oh no...
Should we try an exorcism?
Miss...
Even if you buy me tons of cookies, it's no use.
Sis has already closed her eyes for good.
What the fuck?
I resign...
I'm already sick with guilt.
But can't bear the detectives demanding me to say things I don't know.
Those crazy bastards.
Digging into my affairs instead of looking for the girl!
I don't know them.
I only know the girl's aunt who runs a bakery in Nampo-dong.
How?
Some gangsters tried hitting her up for money,
- so I kicked their asses.
- Is it so?
Anyway, the girl's father called the chief directly and demanded the detective who caught the pockmarked kidnapper.
Just go and talk to them.
Isn't that Jungbu station's jurisdiction?
He'd die rather than let them take the case.
Why?
Last night they took the driver and tortured him pretty bad, asking about his boss's mistresses.
Well, it's no surprise the father blew his top.
His cash holdings are second to none in Busan and they say he pulls strings in Seoul, too.
With all the kidnappings these days, the President ordered a special task force to handle abduction cases.
This could be your chance.
You want to be in the squad forever?
Hell...
You demoted me to the squad for stealing another district's case, now you tell me to steal another?
You think I'm a mutt?
Coming and going at the owner's kick?
Shut your mouth!
If you hadn't called our boss a dumb fuck, you'd still be here!
Is that baker's niece in Sung-han's class?
No, the next class over.
In first grade, they were.
Kids, dad's home!
Welcome home, dad!
Hey, aren't you hot wearing that?
What's with your face, Sung-han?
Chang-gun hit him with a pencil case.
You let him hit you?
Are you a sissy?
!
Our boy punched him first.
Chang-gun was teasing me, saying that cops wipe the butts of the rich.
Those Jungbu dumbasses pulled another stupid...
Stop that, it's disgusting!
Don't hit!
Anyway, that baker's relatives want me back again.
For what?
To find their missing child.
Yes, you should!
I heard they're desperate with grief.
She sends us these cookies all the time.
Don't accept them from now on.
I'm not taking the case.
Why not?
If things go bad and the girl dies, I'll take all the rap.
Why should I take it?
It's not my jurisdiction.
What's happened to you, Detective?
How can you be so cold-hearted?
What the hell did you say?
What's important is the kid, not the jurisdiction!
Would you say that if it were our child?
Don't you know why they sent me to the squad?
Think before opening your mouth!
What's to think about?
You're saying you have time to chase protestors, but no time to save kids just like our own!
Gosh...
They must've given you lots of cookies.
JULY 20 3 DAYS SINCE THE KIDNAPPING
You know... there's a man who just came back from the mountain after prayers.
How about going to see him?
Who is it?
Hello?
Is this Guru Kim's residence?
Who's calling?
JULY 22 5 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING
According to Min-hye who rode with Eun-joo that day, he spoke in a Seoul accent and followed the kids' directions as if he didn't know the way.
It means he's not from here.
And she said he offered them a ride home.
It means he didn't know she usually had a driver.
It seems obvious that he wasn't targeting her in particular.
Min-hye got off first, but if Eun-joo's home had been closer,
I guess it would be Min-hye who got abducted that day.
From the start, investigating resentment as a motive was a waste of time.
That's what I'm saying!
Crazy fools!
But I'm from a different station.
I mean, I can't organize a team myself...
The chief already agreed.
Pardon?
He promised to transfer you temporarily to the metropolitan police so you can join the investigation.
When those gangsters harassed me, you kicked their asses all on your own!
This is a different case.
I don't know about that, anyway, it's your birth destiny to find her!
- What?
- Forget that talk.
I know you caught the man who killed the dealer at Kukje Market as well as the pockmarked abductor.
You must help us.
Later, whether it's money or a promotion,
I'll do anything I can for you.
You have lots of cash, right?
Pardon?
Let's use that first.
After all, the goal of an abduction is money, not the child.
But he needs to contact us so I can pay money!
That's not what I mean.
The kidnapper will surely be watching you
MISSING CHILD NAME:
SUNG EUN-JOO to see if you report to the police.
But if he hears the police started an investigation, the girl will be in danger.
So we need to set up a separate investigation office in a place the kidnapper will never guess.
Sir, you visit all of Busan's press outlets and buy their silence no matter how much it costs.
You and our chief director are close, you said?
Meet him and beg him to make it a closed investigation.
Let me find some way...
And when the phone rings, only mother can answer it.
If he hears a man's voice, he might think it's a cop.
We need to keep this strictly classified to bring Eun-joo back alive.
So he was released from prison?
I see.
Did they send the list of offenders from Seoul who did similar crimes?
They said if they find anything unusual they'll investigate themselves.
I told you to get everything sent down here!
If it's not in their jurisdiction they won't give a damn!
My point exactly.
If it's not your district, get on your high horse and leave.
Don't you agree?
There must be some kids who saw the plate of that car?
I'm sure there are.
But how can they remember the number?
Now you and Eun-joo... when the stranger asks you to, you close the trunk of the car, right?
And you see some numbers on the plate?
What numbers are those?
Two...
And?
Can't you see more?
MIN-HYE: 2
Any more?
- Eight.
- And?
What did your teacher say about Eun-joo?
She went to the States to visit her relatives.
That's right.
And don't tell your friends that I came here to school.
I won't.
Go on.
Were you...
- close to Eun-joo?
- Yeah.
She was nice to kids like me picked for the school by lottery.
Please get her back, Dad.
- What is this?
- String from a whistle.
With so many kidnappings these days,
lots of parents have their kids wear these to school.
7 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING
If it's the same guy, she must be dead already.
You think so?
After being abducted, kids usually cry all night for their parents.
After a couple days, the kidnappers shut them up.
It's easier to go get the ransom with the kid dead.
NO RANSOM DEMAND
Then why isn't this bastard calling?
1 0 days already...
You think she's alive?
- Of course not.
- That's why he doesn't call...
If we don't want to take all the blame, we should open the investigation ASAP, get witness reports and at least catch the kidnapper.
This is Gong at Busan Metropolitan Police.
Is there any report on a little girl's corpse?
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were asleep...
No need to apologize.
We also wanted to check... but were far too scared.
There's been no report so far, so let's wait a bit more.
Gosh... anyway... he has to call on the 1 st.
On the 1 st?
Yes... someone told her that the kidnapper would call on the 1 5th day.
And not to worry, because she's alive.
Who told her that?
A guru.
Guru?
Yes, he also said... that only you have a fate that can save our Eun-joo.
Guru Baek's assistant?
Fortuneteller Baek Jae-hoon, started out dirt poor in 1 970 reading fortunes behind the Government Center.
He moved to Seoul last year after making his fortune.
The Blue House keeps calling on me...
People say he's gifted and precise, predicting who will die, who will pass an exam, or even how many coins are in your pocket.
Kim Joong-san is his assistant...
Real name Kim Geum-tae.
Geum-tae?
What's his background?
Born in Chung-won city, he went to law school and lectured for a political party.
He spent the last 4 years as Baek's apprentice.
When Baek moved to Seoul, Kim took his phone number in Busan.
Now Kim's on his own praying and fortune-telling...
Well educated, he must be a smooth talker.
Thanks for the brief.
Poke out your own eyes, bastard.
Not mine.
Who is it?
Who are you?
Is Mr. Kim here?
Who are you?
I'm a cop.
Here to ask him a few things.
You guys took him already.
Pardon?
You have no alibi for before the kidnapping, and on that exact day, you came home!
How many times should I say it?
I was in the mountains, praying.
Yeah, you think we'll buy that shit?
You went to college in Seoul so I guess you can speak in Seoul accent.
Repeat what you said in Seoul accent.
Speak!
Hey you trickster.
You've gone to temples with her more than once!
You must've planned the kidnapping knowing he has lots of cash in the house.
Better come clean now!
Where did you hide the girl's body?
He really was in a temple in Mt.
Jiri from early June.
I checked his alibi with the Buddhists there.
Why would I take his side?
So you came to me because my birthdate fits?
Not just for that.
Listen to him only when it's needed.
I understand how desperate you are.
But how would other cops react if they find out?
Everyone else says Eun-joo must be dead.
But Guru Kim said firmly
Eun-joo can come back alive only with your help!
I saw your statement.
It says you did something with Great Monk Sungchol?
You used to be a monk?
I was his retinue for 2 years.
But I left, after deciding I couldn't attain the truth with Buddhist scripture only.
You mean you'd rather be fortuneteller than monk?
I chose the path of a guru over the path of a Buddhist.
But that guru couldn't foretell he'd be dragged to the station and beaten?
Could've escaped if you knew.
I can't know everything in this world.
Then why didn't you keep quiet?
Going on about a call on the 1 5th day.
If you pray sincerely for something, it reaches Heaven.
And it could be that prayer comes back as a 'response.'
A response?
The 1 5th day I predicted is the day a tree that's not in Eun-joo's fate meets water so it can revive...
Fine, whatever!
No use explaining to me.
So the clue behind your 1 5th day crap is some response from Heaven?
A response?
That's all you've got?
You got a response.
Don't detectives also feel something like that when chasing criminals?
It's hard to explain but there's an intuition that only you can feel.
Then should I cuff you?
Following my intuition?
When shit like this happens, of course mothers come to you, because they're desperate.
But for me, gurus don't exist.
There are only people who flirt with rich housewives, getting free meals and chasing after cash.
Be prepared next time you say that sort of thing.
Then I'll have a 'response'.
Is this Eun-joo's mother?
Why haven't you called the police?
What the heck do you want?
If it's money, just say how much.
I see...
Is Eun-joo okay?
You're feeding her well?
All that we want... is to bring her back.
Prepare $50,000 in cash.
Then check the circuit breaker box at Gudok APT, 5th floor.
And wait by Mammoth Records in Daesin-dong tomorrow with the cash.
Don't forget.
If the police know, the girl dies.
Did you buy Eun-joo a whistle?
Yes.
She wore it around her neck just in case.
She's alive.
Our girl is alive!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank God!
Guru Kim got it right!
He said it'd come on the 15th day.
Thank you, Guru Kim.
Thank you so much.
Don't worry.
15 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING
Eun-joo's a smart girl.
She'll come home safe.
You'll get the call on the 1 5th day.
- Pardon?
- What?
From whom?
The kidnapper.
It has to be near the river.
Is she alive?
Eun-joo?
From what I can see, she is.
But other fortunetellers told us
Eun-joo has a bad destiny, too much gold and earth.
I don't disagree.
More than six gold, actually.
But those gold and earth run in all directions.
In other words, there is excess in every direction.
Ironically, this can keep her alive.
This Chinese character 'joo' in her name means 'red.'
It's rarely used in names, and it makes her stand out to evil.
Be sure to change her name later.
I will.
Thank you, sir.
Have you ever released captive animals?
Pardon?
You said your husband makes a living catching fish.
I'm asking if you ever saved them instead.
Live well...
Please let my girl live.
AUGUST 2 1ST ATTEMPT TO MEET KIDNAPPER
Come to lmrang Beach before dawn, the day after tomorrow.
AUGUST 4 2ND ATTEMPT TO MEET KIDNAPPER
If I see anyone suspicious, Eun-joo dies.
Come to Manduk Tunnel
- by 2pm tomorrow.
- How many times has it been?
You need to trust us!
If you watched me you'd have seen there was no cop anywhere!
I left directions in the tunnel so follow them with the money.
Where in the tunnel?
What directions?
Don't you miss your daughter?
She misses you a lot.
Either his car's among these, or else they're all cops!
I saw these cars come and go hundreds of times!
Even the car those Americans were driving!
- Why did you trick me?
- You call this an investigation?
You invited the whole force into a confidential operation.
And why the hell was the American authority called in?
What sort of cops get busted by a housewife?
I don't know what the father promised you.
But we're the officially appointed team!
Don't you think you're out of line?
He didn't promise me anything!
We need to keep watch for any suspects or witnesses!
You're the one who put us underground!
What'll you do if the kidnapper stops calling and we find a corpse?
If you hadn't screwed things up from the start,
I wouldn't be here!
AUGUST 1 4 28 DAYS since kidnapping
Wait.
- Hello?
- Boss!
Well... we're not fishing again tomorrow?
Tell them to wait a bit more.
Yes, sir.
Wait a bit longer.
What the fuck!
Can we really trust hypnosis?
We checked at every tollgate in Gyungnam Province and sent requests to the traffic department..
There's no Granada with a plate starting with 28.
There are lots of doubts from above on your investigation.
Who'll be responsible if the case goes nowhere and the girl stays missing?
Can't believe this...
We must not lose our hope yet.
She indeed has too much gold and earth in her fate, but many trees in her mother's fate weaken these gold and earth.
Moreover, the water in Detective Gong's fate can bring her back for sure.
I'm too sick to move anymore.
Wherever you tell me to go, I'm not going.
AUGUST 16 30 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING
My husband and I decided.
I think we've both suffered enough...
Let's meet one last time on the 1 9th in Seoul.
Seoul?
Is Eun-joo there?
I heard her relative lives in Yeouido.
What's the phone number there?
First I'll go to Seoul with Eun-joo's aunt.
Our relative there is an old classmate of the Director General of the National Police.
So we'd like to meet him first.
You know the Chief Inspector on Tv?
- The main actor?
- Not him.
You can see his name in the end credits as an expert advisor.
That person will lead the special team himself.
Then...
No way!
You need to go, no matter what.
They didn't say so, but the other cops felt uncomfortable with me.
And it'd be the same for the Seoul police.
Please accept this.
It's a small sign of my gratitude.
With the best cop in Korea leading the case,
I think it's only a matter of time to find her.
In this world, we need more than just power and money.
I heard your son and my daughter are friends.
So please go to Seoul with Guru Kim and bring my girl back home.
A blood vessel in the nose is ruptured.
Shall we operate now?
It'll hurt, since we'll cauterize with electricity.
You fool... why'd you poke your nose into their business?
You might be proud of it, but don't go around saying you predicted the kidnapper's call.
The cops at Jungbu will drag you in if they find out.
You believe that Eun-joo is still alive, too?
I'm going to Seoul to pray, that the criminal never does anything bad to Eun-joo.
Hello?
Hello, this is Joong-san, sir.
Oh, it's you.
So did you start working for Congressman Son?
I'm... taking time off from that for a while and going to Seoul looking urgently for a kid.
I'm calling on my way up to say hello.
Why are you still looking for the dead girl?
Pardon?
I got her birthdate too a month ago.
Don't waste your time on useless work.
Concentrate on self-cultivation!
You need to know when to be greedy, and when to endure.
I'm sorry, it's not in my place to say this,
- but my reading of her destiny...
- Enough!
Gotta go.
AUGUST 18 YEOUIDO SIBUM APT
Oh, puppy!
Come here!
Nice to meet you.
Eun-joo's father called the head of the National Police in Seoul, which caused a storm at Busan Metropolitan Police.
The director was a nervous wreck explaining it all to superiors.
Anyway, after begging and pleading, they agreed to a joint operation.
So just follow Head Suh's orders and keep quiet!
This is our temporary headquarters when we have a special case.
The Seoul team includes top personnel from each district.
Welcome.
I'm Suh Jung-hak.
I'm Yoo Sang-soon.
Nice to meet you.
Bang Ji-hwan from Busan.
We've never worked with a regional team before.
You can use the desks here.
It's an honor!
The real Chief Inspector!
Are you detective Gong?
I'm Suh Jung-hak.
Oh, I've heard lots about you.
Me too.
You're enthusiastic, as I heard.
What does he think he's doing?
Shooting a film?
Be warned that radio lines can get jammed, since there are many broadcasters here and the North has been sending strong jamming signals recently.
Due to line-of-sight limits,
Busan team and detective Gong communicate via channel 1, and Jungbu team, use channel 6 to transfer received messages to the Seoul team nearby.
What's the case this time?
Don't play dumb!
I know that you set up headquarters here for big investigations.
You'd better shut the fuck up.
Huh?
I ordered special black noodles.
Here it is.
The sauce is separate.
What the fuck!
?
How come there's no fried egg on top!
?
What fried egg?
It doesn't come with that.
You're saying that in Seoul, instead of fried eggs you put this tiny quail egg?
Hello?
It's me.
Have you eaten?
Of course.
Where are you?
The connection is bad.
I'm in Seoul now.
Seoul?
- You in trouble again?
- Goddammit.
I'm working!
Then you should've told me you're going...
Did you bring enough underwear?
I'm too busy to talk.
Put Sung-han on.
Now.
Sung-han!
Hey, Sung-han!
Hurry and pick up the phone.
It's from Seoul!
Dad.
Sung-han.
Do you know what kind of snack Eun-joo likes?
Snack?
She likes sweet jelly sticks.
Sweet jelly sticks?
We'll divide into two groups once the aunt goes out.
The Seoul team, waiting at each assigned spot will close the dragnet focusing on the contact point.
The Busan team will wait by the apartment and then tail the aunt, keeping a 1 00m distance.
Busan team, be sure to disguise yourselves thoroughly, and don't get too close to the contact point.
- They wanna catch him themselves.
- Detective Gong, stay at the apartment and signal the Busan team when the aunt goes out.
What if he takes the money and runs?
If the kidnapper sees the Busan team, he'll know the police are involved.
What should we do if he comes without the girl, grabs the money, and rushes off in a car or motorcycle?
Then what's your idea?
The Seoul team stakes out the contact point, and these female officers follow the aunt on foot while the Busan team follows her in a car with a Seoul plate making sure they don't show their faces.
Then they can back you up if anything happens.
Has anyone from the Busan team lived in Seoul?
Seoul is much bigger than Busan and we can't even cover Yeouido district with this much men.
Let's discuss it in detail when the kidnapper calls again.
He needs money after all.
Eun-joo's alive, right?
Never mind.
By the way, did you get a response?
What time will he call tomorrow?
1 0 AM.
Thank you.
Then I'll go to sleep.
Did Guru Baek say anything?
Like, she's alive or we'll get her back safe?
Wish I could hear something to cheer me up.
AUGUST 19 ATTEMPT TO MEET KIDNAPPER
Hello.
He doesn't say anything...
I'm Eun-joo's aunt.
She was too ill to come to Seoul.
I'll call back this afternoon.
What did he say?
He said he'd call this afternoon.
Goddamn son of a bitch!
Lunch delivery!
Can we talk for a sec?
Have you been here long?
- You look quite familiar.
- You pick up a lot of girls?
Yes, I see.
Cross the Mapo Bridge intersection then turn left...
The building behind Full Gospel Church, 1 st floor pharmacy...
Yes, I get it.
Jungbu, we got the location.
Copy that, roger.
Get ready!
Detective Jo, you...
Detective Gong!
What?
Is there... any chance of an accomplice?
An accomplice?
Since last night,
I keep seeing two men.
Can't be sure of anything at this stage.
You have to keep talking, so the police can approach.
Ask, is she alive?
Where is she?
Did you bring her?
Let me at least talk to her.
I can't pay unless I know she's alive.
Like that.
Gosh...
I'm scared.
Will that crazy freak bring Eun-joo?
Don't be nervous.
Detectives will hide nearby.
Aunt is heading over, roger.
Jungbu, Aunt just left for the pharmacy, roger.
Copy that, roger.
Jungbu, did you confirm she left the complex?
Jungbu!
Jungbu, answer me!
- Where's the district office?
- Confirm if she's left!
Jungbu!
Where are you?
I'm in front of your car!
Jung...
Goddamn bastards!
Jungbu!
Where the hell are you?
Jung....
What are you doing?
Why didn't you tail her?
What?
She hasn't come out.
Didn't you copy when I said she left?
Sure we did.
So we waited, but no one's passed yet.
Cut the bullshit!
We sent Detective Jo, since the kidnapper won't recognize him.
As soon as Jo identifies him, we'll grab him ourselves.
What?
Why should the Seoul bastards get him?
Didn't you see that mother's face?
Damn it.
Chief!
Chief, there's a problem.
Gong found out we didn't tail her.
Seoul team, the signal's weak on channel 6.
Let's change it to 3, roger.
Copy that, roger.
Give me the key!
I need a car, hurry!
- What's wrong?
- What happened?
Chun!
Give him the key!
Here!
What is it?
- What's with him?
- No idea.
Do you know if there's a construction site nearby?
A construction site?
Crosswalk at Mapo Bridge intersection...
Gospel Church...
Turn left..
Seoul on channel 6...
Seoul!
Aunt left 20 mins ago.
Hurry to the pharmacy!
Seoul!
Do you copy?
The aunt has left!
Hasn't she left yet?
I just need the license number of
- the gigolo she's seeing.
- Not beat him up?
He said just to spy on them.
Isn't it channel 6?
Copy Seoul team!
The pharmacy by Full Gospel Church!
Aunt left already!
Answer...
Fuck!
Pharmacy.
Who?
What the heck?
- Fried eggs?
- What?
Hasn't she left yet?
Report us!
- He's a cop!
- There's a call for you inside.
Something's wrong, this is serious.
- A call for me?
- Yes.
Huh?
I'm outta here.
Hey, you!
Wait.
Delivery boy, stop!
That crazy moron!
What a jerk!
I see.
The street by the underpass?
Woman in red pants, with the bangs, was she here?
SEOUL 3GA 2801
Suspect found.
Seoul, are you listening?
Suspect appeared in front of KBS studio.
Seoul, suspect found.
Is this damn thing broken?
BUSAN 1GA 1 132
Damn it.
I keep seeing two men.
Is there any chance of an accomplice?
Since last night, I keep seeing two men
What's wrong?
Let's go.
He took off after observing you for a while.
You... you saw his face?
Yes.
So why didn't you catch him?
Calling a search on a black Granada,
Seoul plate 3GA 2801.
I apologize, sir.
There was a communications issue.
I'd say it's more square than oval.
- Like this?
- Add sunglasses.
Why'd you add a civilian tail without telling us?
Why didn't you mobilize?
I told you already.
We were waiting for the call.
Yes.
Yes.
Goddamn motherfuckers.
They tipped internal affairs.
We promised you money!
Why put us through all this trouble?
Are you mocking us?
Don't you trust us?
We're fed up with this shit.
If you really want the money, you'd better come to us.
It's not like I don't believe you...
But there were suspicious people around.
I've no idea who you're talking about.
Anyway, I won't go anywhere unless you prove that she's still alive!
Don't get so agitated.
Go to the construction site near your place around 1 0PM.
Look for a container.
I left instructions there.
What did that son of a bitch say?
This is driving me nuts.
I don't know if this was the right thing to do.
You should've grabbed him earlier.
If there's an accomplice, Eun-joo could've been hurt.
If it were your son, would you have let him go?
Construction at the site is temporarily on hold.
There's zero visibility at night, so an operation is hardly feasible.
The site's almost 1 0,000 sq. meters, and has quite complicated and dangerous terrain.
Even if the kidnapper brings Eun-joo, we can't predict what will happen during the arrest or escape.
Let's resume the operation again if the suspect calls proposing a day meeting.
Can't we send a female officer disguised as the aunt, with a few other officers staked out?
If the issue is visibility, he won't recognize us either.
Let's resume this when we he calls tomorrow.
Lights on.
What if he doesn't call?
I think my idea is at least worth a try.
And I guess you could've at least tried to call us.
There are things called payphones.
Well, in my opinion, since we've identified the kidnapper's car, there's no reason to continue the operation in Seoul.
Although he's physically in Seoul, we're the official team.
So it'd be better to lure him back to Busan and get him there.
What the fuck?
You've been useless on this case so far, and now that we have an outline of the suspect...
Official team?
You selfish morons!
Would you do that if someone grabbed your kid?
Don't take pictures!
Why are you taking them?
Do you have any idea who asked me to handle this case?
No, who?
Based on past experience, is it realistic to believe that the kid is still alive?
You saw the picture!
Which was sent 2 weeks ago?
The kidnapper got her new clothes, and she didn't look scared at all.
She's definitely alive.
At least for now.
From midnight tonight, the montage of the kidnapper will be distributed nationwide.
What?
The Director General of National Police approved it.
It really is time to turn the case public.
Are you fucking insane?
What about the kid?
All you want is the kidnapper?
Detective Yoo Sang-gi from Busan Seobu Station has been taken to internal Affairs.
He's charged with assault and accepting bribes.
What?
An anonymous letter claims he shared the bribe money with you.
Chief!
A call from the producer at MBC.
The broadcasting station promised their cooperation, too.
You can lose that costume now.
What happens to all dead bugs on the ground?
That's already spilt milk.
No use talking to Yoo.
The bus attendant saw Chil-sung pickpocketing, so he followed her home and slashed her face twice.
She's only eighteen!
She'll live with that scar the rest of her life!
Alright, then.
That's your excuse for assault.
But did you or didn't you receive money?
We always help someone get Officer of the Month.
It's an old practice, how could they...
Did you or didn't you take it?
I did.
Leave for Busan first thing tomorrow.
You're officially off this case.
If we don't find her by sunrise, we'll find a corpse!
We can't let 33 days pass!
We need to go find her, right now!
Go where?
Even if one of them is in the mountain, first go to the construction site in the east.
You'll only get her back alive if it's near water!
Eun-joo has much steel in her fate so it's easily buried in sand, and her fate clashes with Chief Seo's, since he also has too much steel.
But the steel can be cleansed if it meets pure water.
Today is the 33rd day since the kidnapping.
One 3 means 'east,' the other means 'wood,' and today they become water.
So today's the only...
What?
What's wrong?
You'd better cut the crap.
What'll you do if we can't find her?
Aren't we doing all this to find her?
Sure, all you do is sit inside and pray, and put this crap in my shoes.
Huh?
You're blessed if you're right, but take no responsibility if wrong?
What?
Look.
It's detectives who catch criminals, not fortunetellers.
Your bullshit spiritual response or smooth talk is no use at all!
Watch your mouth!
I put my everything into this!
Everything?
What everything?
You ain't got much to begin with.
Snap out of it.
I know how miserable your life is.
And you?
Are you so well off?
What?
All day long you scream at people, thinking you're the best at everything.
So everyone resents you and you're completely alone!
You prick!
If it weren't for your bullshit I'd...
What you said about me is 1 00% correct.
It's all true...
I've been such a self-centered moron, thinking I was the best.
Now look at me.
You really can see things.
A great fortuneteller!
In today's world, pursuing this kind of thing just makes you into a fool.
Whatever I speak out loud, it won't change a damn thing.
But even if I am wrong this time, and people say I can't hold a candle to my teacher,
and if my family loses everything due to my incompetence, there's just one thing left for me.
Conviction.
That's all I've got now.
Poor puppy could've been swept into the river.
We need to do something about those sewer holes.
Thank you so much.
No problem.
Good night, ma'am!
Excuse me, is there a river nearby?
No, it's just that the sewers lead to the river.
Then, where's the construction site?
Do all the drains reach the river?
Sure, all the nearby sewers lead to the river.
Is that so?
I will go to the construction site with Mr. Bae and driver Chun as their birth years are harmonious.
Why a construction site?
Can't escape from the police, even if it's dark.
Doesn't he know the police are involved?
If the abductor had hurt Eun-joo already, it would've been the construction site where there's much sand.
If she's still alive, we could definitely find her somewhere near water.
Huh?
What the heck is it?
Hello.
Who are you?
I am Eun-joo's relative,
living in Seoul.
Her aunt was too scared to come.
Did you bring the money?
Sure, of course.
I got the money.
Give me a sign after putting it in the bag.
Then I'll tell you where she is.
She's somewhere in this site.
I'll tell you the exact location after checking the money.
Where is that son of a bitch?
Here's your money, now tell me where!
Tell me!
She's in that container!
What?
Hey, look.
Hey!
Eun-joo!
Are you there?
Mr. Bae!
Chul-ho!
Kim?
Hey... are you okay?
If the police are involved...
Are you alright?
the girl dies.
You shouldn't speed in the dark!
Security guard?
You rushed out so quickly, I didn't see you.
I'm sorry.
It's killing me...
My back hurts...
Look at my bike, it's all mangled.
I'm really sorry.
Shit, what'll I do with my bike?
Get off.
Damn it!
Don't beat him!
Pull out the key!
Pull out the key!
Where's Eun-joo?
Who... is Eun-joo?
Where is she, you bastard!
What?
I was just told to get the cash.
I do the delivery.
Don't lie to us.
We know that you took her.
Believe me.
I'm just doing the delivery like I was told.
- Words won't work on him.
- No, don't!
You asshole.
Talk to us, bastard.
Where is she?
Or you're dead meat.
Son of a bitch!
Let go of him...
Take it easy.
All right.
How about this?
As long as the kid's alive, we'll let you have the money.
You run off wherever you want.
We don't care if the police get you, we just want her back.
We're her relatives.
He works for her daddy.
It's true.
But..
I...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Do we look like police?
Then why don't we have guns or handcuffs?
If we were police, backups would be rushing in by now.
But look around.
It's only us.
Just give her back to us.
Gosh...
I am so sorry but I really don't know who Eun-joo is.
Damn you...
Born on 1 2th of May, 1 940
Think about it.
Once we turn you in to the police now, we can't do anything for you.
Use your brain, dumbass!
- Don't do that!
- Look ahead!
See?
If you turn left at the next intersection, there's the temporary investigation office.
We'll find Eun-joo sooner or later, but once you get in there, you're done for.
You get that?
Mr. Mae...
It's hard to support your single mother, isn't it?
Actually...
I'm a fortuneteller.
That's why...
I can see Eun-joo is alive, and why you're doing this.
But you know what?
Even if you support your mother with money you earn this way, it will only bring her greater sickness.
How do I know if you're really relatives?
Listen.
Like he said now, you got Eun-joo new clothes, and sweet jelly sticks that her mom never allowed.
We know you treat her well, why call the police?
We can give you money, her dad has tons of it.
Will you keep your promise?
If I don't, I'll be your son.
Turn right.
She's in Mapo.
Mapo...
Where's the Mercedes?
Hey, a Granada just came in.
Check the plate if it passes you.
Granada?
It's right, 2801!
Where, where?
Look, isn't it...
Eun-joo's driver, Chun?
Damn son of a bitch!
He's showing his true colors!
Follow me!
You bastard!
Get that son of a bitch!
Eun-joo!
Poor thing...
It's me, uncle Chul-ho!
Eun-joo!
How were you?
Eun-joo!
It's me.
Eun-joo!
Don't come to him.
- Uncle!
Are we caught by the creditors?
No, they're not creditors.
They're the cops.
Eun-joo, come here.
It's all right now.
- It's okay, don't cry.
- Eun-joo, you poor thing.
You see, she's okay.
Please let me go.
No way.
But, where's the other guy?
What?
I did it myself.
Eun-joo, my darling baby!
Are you okay?
Not hurt?
I tried not to cry in the trunk so the creditors wouldn't get you and dad.
But it was so close...
He told me he was going to end it if he couldn't get the money by tonight since he was so tired of all this, too.
He even said he's relieved.
But... wasn't there an accomplice?
It seems you got that part wrong.
He said it was a one man job.
Why would he lie, instead of sharing the sin with an accomplice?
But what's the big deal?
You got most of it right!
If my back didn't hurt,
I'd carry you on my shoulders all the way to Busan!
AUGUST 20 BUSAN POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Be careful what you say in front of the chief director.
Sergeant Gong Gil-yong, reporting.
Nice work.
You put in a great effort.
Sit down.
Yes, sir!
National Police Headquarters called to ask me some questions.
Although Chief Yoo gave me his side of details...
Give me the details of the arrest.
I heard it was the joint operation of nine detectives.
So who was in charge?
Are you the one who told the father that this investigation needed to be classified?
But if you keep it secret, you should've done it right.
When I was assigned to the case, things were already ugly between the father
- and the Jungbu team...
- Have you... ever cooperated with Jungbu team before?
No, sir.
This was my first time.
But you were both on the scene at the time of arrest?
First, I saw the kidnapper fleeing by car and... struggled to stop him...
grabbing his neck... then...
Be open with me.
Only the two of us will know, anyway.
I was dragged about 20-30 meters...
And it's true that I stopped him and pulled him out of the car.
But then... my colleagues, they helped me.
Well...
Guess it was about five or six of them...
I can't be sure as it was quite hectic.
We were onto him together.
We arrested him... together.
So, there were two arrest units.
The person in charge was Chief Yoo at Jungbu station, right?
Yes... true..
Chief Yoo had a lot of trouble with the father trying to pull strings here and there.
But anyway...
As you said...
since the father pulled strings...
What should we do if Chief Yoo would gossip about this to everyone?
As long as you keep silent, we can pretend nothing awkward happened.
I decided to donate to the police
I decided to donate to the police the $50,000 ransom the kidnapper demanded.
Please use this money to investigate further cases of kidnapping.
Thank you so much for your effort!
Inspector!
Yoo Sang-soon!
Loyalty!
A breathtaking 33-day classified investigation
'I put my life on this case' Chief Yoo Sang-soon
Wonder Fortuneteller Baek foretold her return!
It was Kim, not Baek who found the girl!
You have to verify facts when writing an article!
How come you wrote such lies in the paper?
We checked the facts.
We even called to Seoul.
Baek confirmed himself that he foretold her return.
I gotta go!
Baek didn't...
Is he nuts?
Don't get so mad in this heat.
Have some of this.
You see this?
Your son picture will look a little green
THE RIGHTEOUS KNIGHT GONG GIL-YONG
What's that?
Is it me?
I work my ass off to pay tuition.
And he's drawing cartoons?
Why send him to private school?
You're hopeless...
Joong-san!
Did you read the paper?
I wasn't really sure at first, but when I read her fate again,
I saw she was coming back in exactly 33 days.
Hello?
Do you hear me?
Honey...
My master!
What about him?
He called to congratulate me.
Praised me for doing a good job.
- What did the doctor say?
- He says it's okay.
Let's go.
- Bring the snacks!
- But it's pouring!
Are you okay if I propose to the chiefs that Sang-gi be pardoned under the condition that you're excluded from promotion?
Is that clear?
Yes... that would do.
- Dad!
- Sang-gi!
- The baby?
- It was born.
Is it a boy?
Kim, listen...
I want to get things straight about your contribution.
I'll meet Eun-joo's parents if I have to, and set the record straight.
Just wait.
No, that's fine!
I'm okay.
Honestly, I'm a human being too and I'd be lying if I said I'm not disappointed.
But even so, my teacher got rewarded for his student's deeds.
That's enough.
What are you talking about?
We can't leave things this way!
No, no, please.
The girl came back alive.
That's what matters.
And I did my part, didn't I?
By the way, you'll be promoted eventually.
When you are, be sure to buy me dinner.
Yes, take care.
Yes, yes.
Your nose stopped bleeding.
I'll tell you a secret.
Your dad... foretold it.
His master... he read it wrong.
Excuse me!
Great, you're home!
Girls, he's the one!
Here's the true wonder fortuneteller, who found our girl, Eun-joo!
Look, he's so handsome!
Come quickly!
Look at the marbles!
- Sung-han!
- Eun-joo!
Thanks.
Stop that!
Eun-joo's mom filed a petition for your promotion to headquarters.
She said you're the one who caught the suspect.
Jung-min, hold your mom's hand.
Don't cry kids, stop crying!
Mobilize, everyone!
This is your eldest?
Yes, he's Sung-han.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Squeeze in, everyone!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Hey kids!
It's hotter if you move around.
Sit still, everyone!
We're almost there.
Just a bit more.
Hey, police alert!
Police alert!
Everyone, get down!
All clear now!
Almost there...
Let's go!
Don't push that!
They say... kids are born with the debt from their parents' past life.
That's why most parents are like debtors in front of their kids.
Let me see your hand.
What for this time?
Spread it like this, okay?
- Left or right?
- Let me see...
It's really rare to have lines like yours.
They call the hand with these tough lines a long hand.
You have two big swords in your fate... so you won't be defeated by any big crimes or criminals.
I always thought the lines in my palm
looked skimpy and unsophisticated.
You'll solve another big case in two years, and get promoted again.
You'll make Superintendent six years from that.
And Senior Superintendent in another six years.
Finally, you'll become a police commissioner.
What nonsense!
It's not a simulation game.
No private can be enlisted as a general.
But I feel better already hearing you say that.
Let's eat something.
Let's have some pork.
Don't equate my precious reading with some pork.
You should pay a fee, too.
Of course I'll pay you now that I got promoted.
Let's go!
Detective Gong earned a series of special promotions like Kim foretold.
He retired as senior superintendent after working in the field till the end, despite National Police Headquarters' proposal to appoint him commissioner.
Kim raised his three daughters impeccably and he's still cultivating his body and mind through prayers and fasting in Busan.
1 78 days since the first abduction, the next spring
Sung Eun-joo was kidnapped again, by two men this time.
Gong and Kim joined forces again and had her home four days after she was taken.

What should we do, sis!
I can't believe it.
If he plans to ask for money, then I think she's safe for now.
Do you happen to have any enemies around you'?
It's highly possible that someone you know did this.
This is her room.
People who know you keep cash at home, driver and nanny included,
Sis.
And workers at the fishing company who might have resentments.
We'll investigate, but if we don't get a call in 2-3 days, ma. air.
We need urgently to find a witness, offering a reward if necessary.
L] WEI yesterday!
We just need to check a few more things.
We can't just sit around and wait.
Let's try things our way.
JULY 19 2 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING
There are more than six instances of gold and earth in her fate, which is quite tough for a girl.
I think you should prepare for the worst.
Oh no...
Should we try an exorcism?
Mm...
Even if you buy me tons of cookies, it's no use.
Sis has already closed her eyes for good.
What the fuck'?
I resign...
I'm already sick with guilt.
(gamma imam I]
Those crazy bastards.
Digging into my affairs instead of looking for the girl!
I don't know them.
I only know the girl's aunt who runs a bakery in Nampo-dong.
H ow?
Some gangsters tried hitting her up for money,
- so I kicked their asses.
- Is it so'?
Anyway, the girl's father called the chief directly?
And demanded the detective who caught the pockmarked kidnapper.
Just go and talk to them.
Isn't that Jungbu station's jurisdiction'?
He'd die rather than let them take the case.
WW?
Last night they took the driver and tortured him pretty bad, asking about his boss's mistresses.
Well, it's no surprise the father blew his top.
His cash holdings are second to none in Busan and they say he pulls strings in Seoul, too.
With all the kidnappings these days, the President ordered a special task force to handle abduction cases.
This could be your chance.
You want to be in the squad forever?
He"... mil-Wag Mama, now you tell me to steal another?
You think I'm a mutt'?
Gamma?
Amen
If you hadn't called our boss a dumb fuck, you'd still be here!
[swarm Enema'?
No, the next class over.
In first grade, they were.
Kids, dad's home!
Welcome home, dad!
Hey, aren't you hot wearing that'?
What's with your face, Sung-hen'?
Chang-gun hit him with a pencil case.
You let him hit you'?
Are you a sissy'?
!
Our boy punched him first.
Chang-gun was teasing me, saying that oops wipe the butts of the rich.
Pulled...
Stop that, it's disgusting!
Don't hit!
Anyway, that baker's relatives want me back again.
WEE?
To find their missing child.
Yes, you should!
I heard they're desperate with grief.
She sends us these cookies all the time.
Don't accept them from now on.
I'm not taking the case.
Why
If things go bad and the girl dies, I'll take all the rap.
Why should I take it'?
Mammy
What's happened to you, Detective'?
How can you be so cold-hearted'?
What the hell did you say'?
What's important is the kid, not the jurisdiction!
Would you say that if it were our child?
Don't you know why they sent me to the squad?
'Mama
What's to think about?
You're saying you have time to chase protestors, but no time to save kids just like our own!
Gosh...
They musfve given you lots of cookies.
JULY 2O 3 DAYS SINCE THE KIDNAPPING
You know... there's a man who just came back from the mountain after prayers.
How about going to see him'?
Who is it'?
Hello?
Is this Guru Kim's residence?
Who's calling?
JULY 22 5 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING
According to Min-hye who rode with Eun-joo that day, he spoke in a Seoul accent and followed the kids' directions as if he didn't know the way.
It means he's not from here.
And she said he offered them a ride home.
It means he didn't know she usually had a driver.
Seems obvious that he wasn't targeting her in particular.
Min-hye got off first,
Emit ,
I guess it would be Min-hye
WEE abducted WEE
From the start, investigating resentment as a motive was a waste of time.
That's what I'm saying!
Crazy fools!
Elma
I mean, I can't organize a team myself...
The chief already agreed.
Pardon'?
He promised to transfer you temporarily to the metropolitan police so you can join the investigation.
When those gangsters harassed me, you kicked their asses all on your own!
'Film-aha
I don't know about that, anyway, it's your birth destiny to find her!
- What'?
- Forget that talk.
I know you caught the man who killed the dealer at Kukje Market as well as the pockmarked abductor.
You must help us.
Later, whether it's money or a promotion,
I'll do anything I can for you.
You have lots of cash, right'?
Pardon'?
Let's use that first.
After all, the goal of an abduction
[Emma hail-s I]
That's not what I mean.
The kidnapper will surely be watching you
MISSING CHILD NAME.' SUNG EUN-JOO to see if you report to the police.
But if he hears the police started an investigation, the girl will be in danger.
So we need to set up a separate investigation office in a place the kidnapper will never guess.
Sir, you visit all of Susan's press outlets and buy their silence no matter how much it costs.
You and our chief director are close, you said'?
Meet him and beg him to make it a closed investigation.
Let me find some way...
And when the phone rings, only mother can answer it.
If he hears a man's voice, he might think it's a cop.
We need to keep this strictly classified mam.
am;
I see.
Did they send the list of offenders from Seoul who did similar crimes?
They said if they find anything unusual they' ll investigate themselves.
I told you to get everything sent down here!
If it's not in theirjurisdiotion they won't give a damn!
My point exactly.
Ham-ii Rama.
Doflt you agree?
Manama!
Who saw the plate of that car'?
I'm sure there are.
But how can they remember the number'?
Now you and Euniyoo... when the stranger asks you to, you close the trunk of the car, right'?
Mm m;
What
Two...
And'?
Can't you see more'?

Any more'?
- Eight.

What did your teacher say about Eun-joo'?
She went to the States to visit her relatives.
'WEB
And don't tell your friends that I came here to school.
I won't.
Go on.
Were you...
- close to Eun-joo'?
- Yeah.
She was nice to kids like me picked for the school by lottery.
Ha?
- What is this'?
- String from a whistle.
Wm: [HEW kidnappings mama lots of parents have their kids wear these to school.
7 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING
Mama Emma!
You think so'?
NIH?
abducted, kids usually cry all night for their parents.
After a couple days, the kidnappers shut them up.
It's easier to go get the ransom with the kid dead.
NO RANSOM DEMAND
Then why isn't this bastard calling?
'I O days already...
You think she's alive'?
- Of course not.
- That's why he doesn't call...
If we don't want to take all the blame, we should open the investigation ASAP, get witness reports and at least catch the kidnapper.
This is Gong at Busan Metropolitan Police.
Is there any report on a little girl's corpse?
Thank
I'm sorry.
Thought
No need to apologize.
We also wanted to check... but were far too soared.
There's been no report so far, so let's wait a bit more.
Gosh... anyway... mama-amazed] $121153.
On the 'I st'?
Yes... someone told her that the kidnapper would call on the 15th day.
And not to worry, because she's alive.
Who told her that'?
A guru.
(Emir?
Yes, he also said... that only you have a fate that can save our Euniyoo.
Guru Baeks assistant'?
F-ertuneteller started out dirt poor in 'I970 reading fortunes behind the Government Center.
He moved to Seoul last year after making his fortune.
M;
m...
People say he's gifted and precise, predicting who will die, who will pass an exam, or even how many coins are in your pocket.
Kim Joong-san is his assistant...
Real name Kim Geum-tae.
(Baum-me?
What's his background?
Mushy, he went to law school and lectured for a political party.
He spent the last 4 years as Baek's apprentice.
When Baek moved to Seoul, Kim took his phone number in Busan.
Now Kim's on his own fortune-telling.
VVell educated, he must be a smooth talker.
Thanks for the brief.
Poke out your own eyes, bastard.
Not mine.
Who is it'?
Who are you'?
Is Mr. Kim here'?
Who are you'?
I'm a cop.
Here to ask him a few things.
You guys took him already.
Pardon'?
You have no alibi for before the kidnapping, and on that exact day, you came home!
How many times should I say it'?
I was in the mountains, praying.
Yeah, you think we'll buy that shit'?
You went to college in Seoul so I guess you can speak in Seoul accent.
Repeat what you said in Seoul accent.
Speak!
Hey you trickster.
You've gone to temples with her more than once!
You musfve planned the kidnapping knowing he has lots of cash in the house.
Better come clean now!
Where did you hide the girl's body'?
He really was in a temple in Mt.
Jiri from early June.
Film-a mm;
Buddhists
Why would I take his side'?
So you came to me because my birthdate fits'?
Not just for that.
Listen to him only when it's needed.
I understand how desperate you are.
But how would other oops react if they find out'?
(all-agape ma!
But Guru Kim said firmly
QM;
only with your help!
I saw your statement.
It says you did something with Great Monk Sungchol'?
You used to be a monk'?
I was his retinue for 2 years.
But I left, after deciding I couldn't attain the truth with Buddhist scripture only.
You mean you'd rather be fortuneteller than monk'?
I chose the path of a guru mm Buddhist.
Foretell he'd be dragged to the station and beaten?
Couldve escaped if you knew.
I can't know everything in this world.
Then why didn't you keep quiet'?
Going on about a call on the 15th day.
If you pray sincerely for something, it reaches Heaven.
Ma:
a"
A response?
The 15th day I predicted is the day a tree that's not in Eun-jods fate meets water mam...
Fine, whatever!
No use explaining to me.
So the clue behind your 'I 5th day crap is some response from Heaven?
A response?
That's all you've got'?
Vt-ma
Don't detectives also feel something like that when chasing criminals?
[Eat-s but there's an intuition that only you can feel.
Then should I cuff you'?
Following my intuition'?
When shit like this happens, of course mothers come to you, because they' re desperate.
But for me, gurus don't exist.
There are only people who flirt with rich housewives, getting free meals and chasing after cash.
Be prepared next time you say that sort of thing.
Then I'll have a 'response'.
Is this Eun-jods mother'?
Why haven't you called the police'?
What the heck do you want'?
If it's money, just say how much.
I] ..
Is Eun-joo okay'?
Harm]?
All that we want... is to bring her back.
Prepare $50,000 in cash.
Then check the circuit breaker box at Gudok APT, 5th floor.
And wait by Mammoth Records in Daesin-dong tomorrow with the cash.
Don't forget.
If the police know, the girl dies.
Did you buy Eun-joo a whistle?
Yes.
She wore it around her neck just in case.
She's alive.
Our girl is alive!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank God!
Guru Kim got it right!
He said it'd come on the 15th day.
Thank you, Guru Kim.
Thank you so much.
Don't worry.
15 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING
Eun-jods a smart girl.
She'll come home safe.
You'll get the call on the 15th day.
- Pardon'?
- What'?
F tom whom?
Th?
kidnapper
It has to be near the river.
[swarm
From what I can see, she is.
But other fortunetellers told us
Eun-joo has a bad destiny, too much gold and earth.
I don't disagree.
More than six gold, actually.
But those gold and earth run in all directions.
In other words, there is excess in every direction.
Ironically,
This Chinese character 'joo' in her name means 'red.'
It's rarely used in names, and it makes her stand out to evil.
Be sure to change her name later.
I will.
Thank you, sir.
Have you ever released captive animals?
Pardon'?
You said your husband makes a living catching fish.
I'm asking if you ever saved them instead.
Live well...
Please let my girl live.

AUGUST 4 2ND ATTEMPT TO MEET KIDNAPPER
If I see anyone suspicious, Eun-joo dies.
Come to Manduk Tunnel
- by 2pm tomorrow.
- How many times has it been'?
You need to trust us!
If you watched me you'd have seen there was no cop anywhere!
I left directions in the tunnel so follow them with the money.
Where in the tunnel'?
What directions?
Mm daughter?
She misses you a lot.
Either his car's among these, or else they're all cops!
I saw these cars come and go hundreds of times!
Emma;
ll
- Why did you trick me'?
- You call this an investigation?
You invited the whole force into a confidential operation.
And why the hell was the American authority called in'?
What sort of oops get busted by a housewife?
I don't know what the father promised you.
But we're the officially appointed team!
Don't you think you're out of line'?
He didn't promise me anything!
We need to keep watch for any suspects or witnesses!
You're the one who put us underground!
Whafll you do if the kidnapper stops calling and we find a corpse?
If you hadn't screwed things up from the start,
I wouldn't be here!
AUGUST 'I4 28 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING
Wait.
- Hello?
- Boss!
Well...
Milan-ii
Tell them to wait a bit more.
Ma. air.
Wait a bit longer.
What the fuck!
Can we really trust hypnosis?
Tollgate Elm and sent requests to the traffic department.
There's no Granada with a plate starting with 28.
There are lots of doubts from above on your investigation.
Who'll m;
and the girl stays missing?
Can't believe this...
We must not lose our hope yet.
She indeed has too much gold and earth in her fate, but many trees in her mother's fate weaken these gold and earth.
Moreover, the water in Detective Gongs fate harm
I'm too sick to move anymore.
Wherever you tell me to go, I'm not going.
AUGUST 16 3O DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING
[WI]
Manna-wan;
..
Let's meet one last time on the 19th in Seoul.
Seoul?
ls Eun-joo there?
I heard her relative lives in Yeouido.
What's the phone number there'?
First I'll go to Seoul with Eun-jods aunt.
Our relative there is an old classmate of the Director General of the National Police.
So we'd like to meet him first.
You know the Chief Inspector on TV'?
- The main actor?
- Not him.
You can see his name in the end credits expert adviser
That person will lead the special team himself.
Than...
No way!
You need to go, no matter what.
They didn't say so, but the other oops felt uncomfortable with me.
And it'd be the same for the Seoul police.
Ma.
It's a small sign of my gratitude.
With the best cop in Korea leading the case,
I think it's only a matter of time to find her.
In this world, we need more than just power and money.
I heard your son [my daughter
So please go to Seoul with Guru Kim and bring my girl back home.
A blood vessel in the nose is ruptured.
Shall we operate now'?
It'll hurt, since we'll cauterize with electricity.
Vim] ..
Why'd you poke your nose into their business?
You might be proud of it, but don't go around saying you predicted the kidnappefs call.
The oops at Jungbu will drag you in if they find out.
You believe that Eun-joo is still alive, too'?
Emit-ska that the criminal never does anything bad to Eun-joo.
Hello?
Hello, this is Joong-san, sir.
Oh, it's you.
So did you start working for Congressman Son'?
I'm... taking time off from that for a while and going to Seoul looking urgently for a kid.
I'm calling on my way up to say hello.
Why are you still looking for the dead girl'?
Pardon'?
I got her birthdate too a month ago.
Don't waste your time on useless work.
Concentrate on self-cu ltivation!
Wont-s 'Mimi-s
Mimi-s
I'm sorry, it's not in my place to say this,

Gotta go.

This is our temporary headquarters when we have a special case.
The Seoul team includes top personnel from each district.
Welcome.

Bang Ji-hwan from Susan.
We've never worked with a regional team before.
You can use the desks here.

The real Chief Inspector!
Mama
[I'm QM] Jung-hak.
Oh, I've heard lots about you.
Me too.
You're enthusiastic, as I heard.
What does he think he's doing'?
Shooting a film'?
Be warned that radio lines can get jammed, since there are many broadcasters here and the North has been sending strong jamming signals recently.
Due to line-of-sight limits,
Busan team and detective Gong communicate via channel 'l, and Jungbu team, use channel 6 to transfer received messages to the Seoul team nearby.
What's the case this time'?
Don't play dumb!
I know that you set up headquarters here for big investigations.
You'd better shut the fuck up.
[Hum
Here it is.
Thais
What the fuckl?
How come there's no fried egg on top!

What fried egg'?
It doesn't come with that.
Mum a?
you put this tiny quail egg'?
Hello?
It's me.
Have you eaten?
Course.
Where are you'?
The connection is bad.
I'm in Seoul now.
Seoul?
- You in trouble again?
- Goddammit.
I'm working!
Then you shouldve told me you're going...
Did you bung enough underwear'?
I'm too busy to talk.
Put Sung-hen on.

Sung-hen!
Hey, Sung-ham!
Hurry and pick up the phone.
[Hall
Dad.
Sung-hen.
Do you know what kind of snack Eun-joo likes?
Snack?
She likes sweet jelly sticks.
Sweet jelly sticks?
We'll divide into two groups once the aunt goes out.
The Seoul team, waiting at each assigned spot mum;
m;
The Busan team will wait by the apartment and then tail the aunt, keeping a 100m distance.
Busan team, be sure to disguise yourselves thoroughly, and don't get too close to the contact point.
- They wanna catch him themselves.
- Detective Gong, stay at the apartment and signal the Busan team when the aunt goes out.
What if he takes the money and runs'?
If the kidnapper sees the Busan team, he'll know the police are involved.
What should we do if he comes without the girl, grabs the money, and rushes off
Maw
Then what's your idea'?
The Seoul team stakes out the contact point, and these female officers follow the aunt on foot while the Busan team follows her in a car with a Seoul plate making sure they don't show their faces.
Then they can back you up if anything happens.
Has anyone from the Busan team lived in Seoul?
Seem is much bigger than Susan and we can't even cover Yeouido district with this much men.
Let's discuss it in detail when the kidnapper calls again.
He needs money after all.
Eun-jods alive, right'?
Never mind.
By the way, did you get a response?
What time will he call tomorrow?
IlfifilflML
Thank you.
Then I'll go to sleep.

I keep seeing two men.
Is there any chance of an accomplice?
Since last night, I keep seeing two men
What's wrong?
Lab
He took off after observing you for a while.
You... you saw his face'?
Yes.
So why didn't you catch him'?
Calling a search on a black Granada, 2801
I apologize, sir.
There was a communications issue.
I'd say it's more square than oval.
- Like this'?
- Add sunglasses.
Why'd you add a civilian tail without telling us'?
Why didn't you mobilize'?
I told you already.
We were waiting for the call.
Yes.
Yes.
Motherfuckers.
They tipped internal affairs.
We promised you money!
Why put us through all this trouble'?
Are you mocking us'?
Don't you trust us'?
We're fed up with this shit.
If you really want the money, you'd better come to us.
It's not like I don't believe you...
But there were suspicious people around.

Anyway, I won't go anywhere unless you prove that she's still alive!

What did that son of a bitch say'?
This is driving me nuts.
I don't know if this was the right thing to do.

If there's an accomplice, Eun-joo could've been hurt.
Were your would you have let him go'?
Construction at the site is temporarily on hold.
There's zero visibility at night, so an operation is hardly feasible.
The site's almost 10,000 sq. meters, 51$ complicated 'Hannah.

Let's resume the operation again was a
Can't we send a female officer disguised as the aunt, with a few other officers staked out'?
If the issue is visibility, he won't recognize us either.
Let's resume this when we he calls tomorrow.
Lights on.
What if he doesn't call'?
I think my idea is at least worth a try.
And I guess you could've at least tried to call us.
WEE payphones.
Well, in my opinion, since we've identified the kidnappefs car, there's no reason to continue the operation in Seoul.
Although he's physically in Seoul, we're the official team.
So it'd be better to lure him back to Busan
Minimum.
What the fuck'?
You've been useless on this case so far, and now that we have an outline of the suspect... imam'?
You selfish morons!
Would you do that if someone grabbed your kid'?
Don't take pictures!
Why are you taking them'?
Do you have any idea who asked me to handle this case'?
Nb,
Based past experience, is it realistic to believe that the kid is still alive'?
You saw the picture!
Which was sent 2 weeks ago'?
WE kidnapper FE?
And she didn't look scared at all.
She's definitely alive.
At least for now.
Midnight tonight, the montage of the kidnapper will be distributed nationwide.
WEE?
The Director General of National Police approved it.
It really is time to turn the case public.
Are you fucking insane?
What about the kid'?
All you want is the kidnapper'?
Detective Yoo Sang-gi from Busan Seobu Station has been taken to Internal Affairs.
He's charged with assault and accepting bribes.
WEE?

You can lose that costume now.
What happens to all dead bugs on the ground'?
That's already spilt milk.
No use talking to Yoo.
The bus attendant saw Chil-sung pickpocketing, so he followed her home and slashed her face tan/ice.
She's only eighteen!
She'll live with that scar the rest of her life!
Alright, then.
That's your excuse for assault.
But did you or didn't you receive money'?
We always help someone get Officer of the Month.
It's an old practice, how could they...
Did you or didn't you take it'?
I did.
Leave for Busan first thing tomorrow.
You're officially off this case.
If we don't find her by sunrise, we'll find a corpse!
We can't let 33 days pass!
Whit-shag,
Go where?
Even if one of them is in the mountain, first go to the construction site in the east.
You'll only get her back alive if it's near water!
Eun-joo has much steel in her fate so it's easily buried in sand, and her fate clashes with Chief See's, since he also has too much steel.
But the steel can be cleansed if it meets pure water.
Today is the 33rd day since the kidnapping.
One 3 means 'eastj the other means 'woodf and today they become water.
So today's the only...
What'?
What's wrong?
You'd better out the crap.
Whafll you do if we can't find her'?
Aren't we doing all this to find her'?
Sure, all you do is sit inside and pray, and put this crap in my shoes.
Huh'?
You're blessed if you're right, but take no responsibility if wrong?
WEE?
Look.
It's detectives who catch criminals, not fortunetellers.
Bullshit or smooth talk is no use at all!
WEBER
I put my everything into this!
Everything?
What
You ain't got much to begin with.
Snap out of it.
I know how miserable your life is.
And you'?
Are you so well off'?
WEE?
All daylong you scream at people, thinking ma:
So everyone resents you you're completely alone!
You prick!
If it weren't for your bullshit I'd...
What you said about me is 100% correct.
It's all true...
I've been such a self-centered moron, thinking I was the best.
Now look at me.
You really can see things.
Fortuneteller!
In today's world, pursuing this kind of thing?
Just makes you into a fool.
Whatever I speak out loud, it won't change a damn thing.
But even if I am wrong this time, my llama to my teacher,
and if my family loses everything due to my incompetence, there's just one thing left for me.
Conviction.
That's all I've got now.
Puppy mm.
Whit-s
Thank you so much.
No problem.
Good night, mefam!
Excuse me, is there a river nearby?
No, it's just that the sewers lead to the river.
Then, where's the construction site'?
Do all the drains reach the river'?
Sure, all the nearby sewers lead to the river.
Is that so'?
I will go to the construction site with Mr. Bae and driver Chun
Walkman-a
Why a construction site'?
Mmm [Ea [hm m;
If the abductor had hurt Eun-joo already, it would've been the construction site where there's much sand.
If she's still alive, we could definitely find her somewhere near water.
Huh?
What the heck is it'?
Hello.
Who are you'?
I am Eun-jods relative,

Her aunt was too scared to come.
Did you bring the money'?
Sure, of course.
I got the money.
Give me a sign after putting it in the bag.
Then I'll tell you where she is.
She's somewhere in this site.
I'll tell you the exact location after checking the money.
Where is that son of a bitch'?
Here's your money, now tell me where!
Tell me!
She's in that container!

I was just told to get the cash.

- No, don't!
You asshole.
Talk to us, bastard.
Where is she'?
Or you're dead meat.
Son of a bitch!
Let go of him...
Take it easy.
All right.
How about this'?
As long as the kid's alive, we'll let you have the money.
You run off wherever you want.

Think about it.
Once we turn you in to the police now, we can't do anything for you.
Use your brain, dumb-ass!
- Don't do that!
- Look ahead!
See'?
If you turn left at the next intersection, there's the temporary investigation office.
We'll find Eun-joo sooner or later, but once you get in there, you're done for.
You get that'?
Mir.
Mm...
[Eat-s , isn't it'?
Actually...
I'm a fortuneteller.
That's why...
I can see Eun-joo is alive, and why you're doing this.
But you know what'?
Even if you support your mother with money you earn this way, it will only bring her greater sickness.
How do I know if you're really relatives?
Listen.
Like he said now, you got Eun-joo new clothes, and sweet jelly sticks that her mom never allowed.
We know you treat her well, why call the police'?
We can give you money, her dad has tons of it.

Are we caught by the creditors'?
No, they're not creditors.
They' re the cops.
Eun-joo, come here.
It's all right now.
- It's okay, don't cry.
- Eun-joo, you poor thing.
You see, she's okay.

Why would he lie, instead of sharing the sin

Be careful what you say in front of the chief director.
Sergeant Gong (EH-yang, reporting.
Nice work.
You put in a great effort.
Sit down.
Yes, sir!
National Police Headquarters called to ask me some questions.
Although Chief Yoo gave me his side of details...
Give me the details of the arrest.
I heard it was the joint operation of nine detectives.
So who was in charge?

No, sir.
This was my first time.
But you were both on the scene at the time of arrest'?
First, I saw the kidnapper fleeing by car and... struggled to stop him...
grabbing his neck... then...
Be open with me.
Only the two of us will know, anyway.
I was dragged about 20-30 meters...
And it's true that I stopped him and pulled him out of the car.

For things that are afraid.
For things that are ashamed.
For things that can not explain for themselves.
Secrets are like scars.
My father says that can not live without heap small collection of them.
But like scars also the secrets should be better hide.
Until the day that someone found them.
Why do not you told me I am released?
It was not sure.
Furthermore, there were circumstances, who had to kill before they kill me.
Want a cookie?
- No.
And how long will you stay with us?
While I'm sure I will not begin to drink again.
Felina is the desperate opponent of Felina.
And I need allies.
- This conversation we've fought already.
Now it's different.
- Good.
Let's bet,
How long will endure before You steal our booze.
If I decide to stay here, you have to hide the booze.
Fine.
And we will all cease to live.
I know I'm confused you think of parents but one day the kids really look as them.
Enough.
If our family has a problem, we have to protect each other.
I have a better idea.
We will come to you every day.
Honey, last night was my first night of freedom.
But he came to see me one familiar.
Mess with a liar.
I think he has a family, but she still does not know ...
You put your salt.
I had to listen all night.
A cordial conversations lead to intimate drinks.
I do not want to risk it ...
- Mom, what room you choose?
Shakespeare is too complicated to You .
You do not understand love.
You understand only intercourse, amateur ones.
Why you keep silence now?
Last night, Chelsea have two to zero.
Five people will come tonight.
There will be no party.
Our gathered.
- Then shake Bobby for "goodbye."
Who fret with oily his voice?
To come and explain to all what he wrote Shakespeare in "Romeo and Juliet".
Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet.
Ay, ay, ay. "For Romeo and Juliet" ...
And who will hear this voice from the second balcony?
Juliet is a humble girl instead neighborhood waitress whom pick up footballer.
Do you have any idea how to get rid off Bobby and other invited?
-No.
- Then get rid off your parents somewhere.
Quiet!
Five times I asked for silence if someone isnt interested, better go out.
Well, let's see now this, the same in a different way.
Our not talking.
I can not hike them even more together.
You said They had gathered?
... And baptized a second time will be anything, but no Romeo.
Oh, who are you under the cloak of night raids in ...
Oh!
I said "in a different way," not to be beaten on stage!
Fate, abused with Juliet.
Are you still wondering about the party?
How you can blackmail me to stay in my house?
It resents you?

If so, after you threw the whiskey in the clinic, we're even.
Never learned to lie!
I do not even drink whiskey.
Mom, come on.
Well, say what you want from me?
Let me be not involved in your problems.
What do you know about my problems?
Mika is already a woman who only tolerated me.
Because my work is unimportant, my money is insufficient my sexual desires - inappropriate.
And you think someone with calf enthusiasm
Will admire the successes in your work?
Yasmina has nothing to do with my marriage.
- Last night was not thinking right.
What does she said?
- Why do not you ask her yourself?
You have no right to judge me, just you.
Record holder in failed marriages.
Maybe I have.
We both lie our relatives?
Save your lecture.
My life is complicated enough.
Then make it opposite, easy.
Now, if Maria dump, she'll find a man before you find your boxers.
You'll end up like me - a failed hero, completely rejected by their children.
Careful, I will follow.
Broil your wits!
If I wanted a hunting hound, I'd buy.
Be careful how you talk to me!
I may be old, but I have the strength to you a spanking.
Should I throw and medical alcohol?
Bit overestimating my problem, my dear.
But I will not give up a cup of tea.
Tony, you'll do you brew?
What are you going to do?
I still do not know.
But for the dinner with Alexander currently I have a police record.
-Show me someone in the community, who do not powder his nose, to ask him how he does it.
You are talking about me.
- You are no longer on the list.
I think to refuse his project.
- You habe No other customers.
I know.
It is not good policy to argue with life when you have no money.
For him there is nothing in google.
It's like you meet a dead man.
I think it's interesting ...
Yes.
If the "interesting" is the new word for presumptuous upstart.
Unlike your husband, with whom you do not even speak.
With Tony can not live without each other.
Clear
- Stockholm Syndrome - the victim attached to the kidnapper.
Nonsense.
We're just slightly bored.
We need a challenge.
Then challenge each other.
- And how?
Competition with darts?
Vibrating.
Yes.
My whole body was tense.
- No body, but your phone.
ALEXANDER:
I want to continue what we started.
Are you looking for something special?
I'm just looking.
- Whatever you like - is yours.
My mother would not say such thing never.
Why do not you tell me more about it?
Well it is threshed with various men while I roamed the streets.
We're not close.
But you are a cooler than she is.
Thanks.
Though not know me at all.
Well, at least not jealous.
- On the contrary.
So I dumped your uncle told me he was in love with some PR.
And how can you be sure that it has led here and other women?
While I was gone?
This means that he is still good.
Pervert!
If I was, would never get back.
I'm allergic to two things.
Infidelity and soy sauce.
But I learned to forgive infidelity.
Even if you slept with friends of yours?
I left him a few months ago.
Surely he suffered.
And they reminded him of me.
Does not matter.
I will find new friends.
You coming?
Where?
I want to prepare something special for your uncle.
Long not eaten a decent meal.
So you look at the sex as an obligation to a department?
Noo.
At the beginning it was not so.
But after the birth of twins
She is different.
- You have to take the initiative.
And you every time lie down on your back and waiting for me to do all the work.
I work in the office 18 hours.
Unlike you.
Why do you think to manage home and children is not a profession?
To wake up with baby vomit is not working?
And much more important than yours.
I'm a hundred times more knowledgeable than half of the people
You work with.
Mr. Counselor.
I left my career to wipe bottoms.
But I do not complain.
And it's a job like any other.
No complaining?
Then why are we here?
I offer you to sell the twins, or go to a hotel.
Cheap, seedy in which people go only for sex.
Please?
And no blather for families, children, relatives and other animals.
A little romance will not repair your marriage but will tighten the bolts.
Look!
I have important work.
Can not we have romance at home?
No.
Do not end up like the man and the woman who burned their house.
They stood outside and waited for the firecar.
The woman said:
"Great.
From 13 years for the first time we have together outside."
Nice story.
See?
We finished today.
- So fast?
Pay per hour, not per month.
Yasmina?
- Wrong number.
Why are you closing?
Because I avoid you Tony.
- Am I entitled to protection?
After the mess that got me - not.
I had problems with my daughter.
Because of that we break up?
"Break up"?
We have no connection to break it.
Only eat spaghetti, drink and fuck in the apartment of your mother.
Why did not you say that you live with her?
Because my dictionary does not recognize her as a word.
What else lied?
We agreed no one should delve into the lives of others.
Yes, I do not burrow and no longer play with you.
Yasmina, I miss the sounds of you ...
Tony ...
Want to kidnap outside the city?
I'll give you the phone, pockets ...all
We'll talk about anything you find inside.
Hello, Yasmina ...
Careful, Tony.
For every truth you are telling, I will drop off a garment of my body.
So be most honest with me.
I'll call you.
I will prepare salmon with bourbon.
This is not supposed to be an ordinary dinner?
Honey, just ordinary men are impressed by the mundane.
You feel insecure, right?
I feel like a queen, which will cook for their king.
Besides, tonight will broadcast the interview in which spoke of me.
We have to cheers.
If you add brown rice to salmon the picture will be complete.
- Good idea!
A girl from the street seems to know a lot about the food.
I did not care who it is.
My house has historic value and I will not let my balcony to be overshadowed by his clownish hotel.
How do I know?
I Do researching.
Block its construction before it started.
Sorry, it was a conversation on business.
My lucky jacket.
With it do its most successful deals.
- Do you always play so dirty?
Does not depend on me.
If you allow someone to think that you are equal, he will immediately decide that he excel.
Nice thought.
But let me tell you one.
We will not finish the job.
Already prepared the contract.
But you act destructively.
I thought the dinner you had fun.
Yes.
And I finished in 5th district as a Christmas turkey stuffed with cocaine.
With cocaine?
- Which cost me arrest for assault on a police officer and a criminal record.
You dreamed it.
- Dreamed?
Do not mock, please!
- Wait.
Hello?
Hi, I am.
Can you check something?
My close, very close, says Maria Lacheva.
She says that last night you have arrested for assault on a police officer.
Yes.
What?
Something went wrong?
Yeah, I thought so.
Thanks.
Bye.
Did I tell you that you dreamed?
Now can we talk business?
Good morning, Mom.
- Good.
Yes, I want to keep my room by you.
Yes, tonight.
Breakfast included.
Perfect.
Mom what are you doing?
Clean your tablet.
- How?
With eyes?
:DDD
Why you spoke outside?
- The house has no range.
Very strange, because I have.
And how did after no one calling you?
Should I pull out and my gun?
No.
If you do not shoot.
If you need me, I'll be in my room.
Mom, my tablet.
Please.
My father?
Is it true that two people after a quarrel, then the sex is better?
Once the dispute with your mother was like this.
Now after a dispute only continue to argue.
-In your horoscope says that today is troublesome day full of lies and intrigue.
Will thrust down tensions with partner only if you choose an appropriate way and time.
For all I agree with your mother and without talking to her.
Tell her I'm leaving.
- Where?
At a seminar.
I'm going to fix my luggage.
My father forgot your ...
If that's all I can see the house project.
Are you hungry?
- No.
Declined to share my food?
I have diets that do not like to break.
Do you relax at all?
We work together.
I start to feel ...
Just invite you to a picnic lunch.
Please!
Cross the border.
Ouch!
Sorry, your jacket ...
I'm sorry, I'll clean it up.
Sorry ...
ANTON VASILEV (this is Tony)
I'll pay the chemical.
I have to go.
Sorry.
I had forgotten that you can be such romantic.
Mickey?
- I got your text messages.
My text messages?
"While silent miss opportunities to make peace today in the mountains. "
I think we need to work on our marriage.
By ten minutes I'll be ready.
Super!
Shit, shit, shit!
Hello, Yasmina, I'm Tony.
I have a problem at work.
We must postpone the trip.
Hello, Yasmina.
I hope you did not prepare your luggage ... because we have to postpone it.
We have to postpone.
Yasmina, will unfortunately have to postpone.
Hello, Yasmina?
- Ready?
Yeah ...
Not yet.
I will not go with you.
- What?
Have to stay in Sofia.
And can not we talk?
Yes.
Do not call me.
I will seek.
And now ...
Hello?
Yasmina ...
I hope you have a plan for our romantic trip?
Since when we listen Serbian music?
- A friend show me that music.
Spin for half an hour.
- Do not hurry.
According to the map, the hotel is to the north.
The last time makes a map of the north, went to Greece.
Why not ask someone?
Plural.
- Please?
When you want to do something, you use the plural.
It sounds like "we are soiled" or "we are hungry", etc.
I'm not a baby, to talk to me like that.
You and I are individuals.
Sorry.
- I can handle myself.
Still you had to go the other way.
What are you doing?
- I suggest you drive.
Opss!
Are you happy?
- Will not you do something?
Like what?
Beef stew?
Sorry, honey, can you little ...
Come on ... come forth.
Come on it begin!
Lia, my dear, would you increase a little?
You watch "The Dark Side of Fame", and I talk with Georgi Andreev.
TV producer, whom we love.
We can hate.
But we can not forget, because he is always on top.
Are you nervous?
- And you?
No.
Because we'll talk about your women, not mine.
Do not forget I'm your boss and I control my editors.
Not in my show.
We do both.
Let's move on to women.
- I only have one.
Wait a minute.
You are rich, famous, around you is full of young girls.
How do you keep still married?
I'm with my wife for twenty years.
We've been through a lot.
Even at Christmas I got drunk and started to kiss her.
What do you tell me now?
Are not you tempted by young girls?
They will do anything for you.
Not for me, but for theirself.
They are the generation: "I want", and can not even express themselves properly.
When someone like his writing text messages:
Tu-yu-tout (2U2), Bi-ar-bi (BRB), Bi-ar-es (BRS) ...
I'm old-fashioned man, for I am still with Kameliya.
you always know when you meet someone special?
I do not know.
Ask my wife.
She is happy with me.
Did you hear that?
There were rumors that divorced
Rumors of my divorce are greatly exaggerated.
Tell Sis.
- It's not your sister, Emma is.
Tonight we party at your home.
We want some Famous for shine.
Can you help?
- My mother is not dead?
Gone to love weekend with ... (DARA suggests) Tony.
- Tony.
What time is the party?
- After nine.
Okay, I'm coming.
And why are our famous friends of Leah?
Because if the party you hang a few covers of magazines, tomorrow will the most popular in all the school.
Even for Bobby.
I do not know what to wear?
Try this
Leopard leggings?
- Have not you watched Discovery?
Once the boys could have sex only if it brought the skin of the leopard.
So today they see this pattern, it immediately becomes the bonner.
I do not care.
This is not me.
Think how sweet and how Bobby will have to seduce ...
What do I see?
I do not know.
- Hairs.
Moss.
- Moss?
Can you imagine?
Bobby is excited dreams of wrapping her legs around him, hand across them and suddenly felt this ... moss.
No.
So you have to be sexy or you can ...
What?
When men do it for the first time with a new woman sometimes they have trouble with erections.
And nothing like hair or cheap underwear should not distract them.
Girls, how many guests we expect?
A maximum of ten.
So, sandwiches and soft drinks will be enought.
Philly ...
If there was a meeting with someone like ...
Leonardo DiCaprio, how would you dress?
Come.
Why is this girl still here?
- That girl?
Is not your niece?
No, before you sit down at the table.
And why should meddle in her life?
Because there is currently no place to live.
Do not you hate to be with us?
Life is hard.
Let convened.
Leah is great.
In the nose a little bit like your brother, but more like you.
- Right?
Yes.
Aside chest.
Quite gifted, do not you think?
Hello!
I watched your interview.
It was no-waste.
- Non-waste ...
SHe wants to say cool.
- Right?
Uncle for the first time, Explain publicly in love.
Suggest to dinner.
- Before I propose to drink.
For mature women and shitty muffins.
Those where confuse google and Gogol when tied after knocking conversation with someone clever.
Rice looks great.
I only said that when girls talk, the audience does not understand anything.
We need subtitles.
Uncle audience long ago can no longer read.
What are you talking now?
- NMZ.
Does not matter.
I get out.
And there have no dinner with us?
- Mmm.
What's happened?
- What's happened ...
Honestly?
I can not take it anymore.
NMZ.
More importantly, that the interview was your ... how he said Leah ... no-waste.
Recently pretty nice to me.
Are you complaining?
- No, but I get suspicious.
Do you keep more bare our pictures from Bali?
Everything valuable is in my old computer.
Why?
Because we can enrich the collection.
- Right?
Battery low?
Hello, lover.
How do I look?
- Good.
Only good?
- Blinding well.
Your wife knows you're here?
- Meaning?
You heard me.
Your wife knows you're here?
No.
SHe thinks I'm in a seminar.
Oho!
Use of undercover work
And when will you mean for us?
- I can not.
Why?
Well ... because ...
A) I'm happily married b) because I'm a quitter fool and c) because my wife will kill me.
Apparently quite a thought on the subject.
What about your wife about it?
Mickey ...
You got one of those pills "oh, horror, finished in you?"
I have.
Now shut up because kill romance.
Tony shoes ...
- You've chose them.
Lying with them on sheets.
- Nothing.
Go on ...
But these are our sheets.
Bring your sheets at home?
You know I never sleep in the hotel.
Once you do not care about sheets.
Mickey, let's move on.
Please!
And not.
No ...
- Kick off them and will continue.
No, no, no ...
Forget it.
You have too many rules, to be a lover.
And you do not have any.
Yasmina?
- Who is looking for her?
Cabbage!
If you expect to do the same will surely arrest us.
Sorry, we went wrong address.
- I see.
Dara your guests came.
Welcome! We agreed no shit!
Good evening!
- Mr. Shakespeare.
I did not know that tonight there will be enemies.
I'm not an enemy, the children invited me as a friend, but I can play and security.
Oh, you know what the word "play"?
You start a lot to surprise me.
Welcome!
(DARA) This is my chance to break up with chastity belt.
And all I have to do is just to behave normally.
Dara ...
- Bobby ...
We must keep our carpets.
Yes.
Be careful with carpets.
What is this?
These are Condoms for shoes.
Put them.
Well, boys and girls, on the left is drinking the right tuck.
The party can start now.
Should we talk quitely?
No.
My grandmother withstand any noises.
Can I order for you?
- I'm on a diet.
I should not mix ...
Tonight not.
Can I?
Have you chosen?
- For me and my special friend the mother of my children, mussels Provencal with more sauce.
As we love them, right?
I can recommend wine ...
- Bring us the most expensive.
80 leva a bottle.
- Tony?
Are you married?
- No.
Excuse me.
Can you hear me all?
I and this woman are together for seventeen years.
Those of you who want to shoot us can benefit.
We've been through everything:
passion, love, friendship, boredom ...
Tonight I want to go back to passion.
Thank you for your attention!
Good night!
Give the most expensive.
- Thanks.
Very sweet.
But how the word "passion" is tied with "the mother of my children?"
What's wrong?
Just what am I to you?
The mother of your children ...
And the love of my life.
- So I am no longer a sexual object?
For example, "the blond chick that still drives me crazy" ...
Mickey, you're what make me see ... but I like the view.
I see.
And what do you see now?
Things that do not want to see the entire restaurant.
And why?
I've nursed your children.
Okay, I give up.
You're Mickey after seventeen years, just as it was seventeen years ago.
And something else.
If tonight in the hotel noisy, it will be from our room.
Thank you.
Now to call you children?
(DARA) Oh, no.
I have friends who have friends, who are their friends.
I'm Joan of Arc, which will burn the family stake.
If I have not burned by my own hormones.
Hello.
- Hello.
How is Nat?
-In plaster for several weeks.
Sorry.
Someone has to save us from this music.
Do not you like it?
- No.
Me too.
Sometimes I think that everything in me is in reward.
I did not know you were gay.
- What?
I did not know you were gay.
- I'm not gay.
I just do not like what they all losers like.
What?
(DARA) "Everything in reward"
I want the mothership to pick me up before I stump up more shit.
No.
Not now.
Now it is happening something fantastic.
Sorry.
I heard nothing.
- What?
Very nice garden.
- My mother wanted a pool, but a pig drowned in the pool of her friend and she refused.
Pig?
(DARA) No, you ninny!
Scheherazade has charmed its king with tales of love and lust.
Not with stories about ...
- Yes, pig.
Neighbors had a pig.
(DARA) Please, keep going.
My ears faded, but I still have the strength to follow your tongue.
Do you want something to drink?
I can not ....
Yes.
If you want me to ...
- I'll get you.
We urgently need to get out of here.
- If you go to bed will reduce music.
Honey, if I went to bed, You would know immediately.
Going out for a few hours and come back I want everything to be cleared.
For the record
- I was not so noisy as it was you.
Is that why you removed us from the train station of that country ...
What was her name?
- No, I do not remember.
We did not have money, you showed your tits to the ticket seller ...
Only five seconds.
Through the glass.
And there was no one at the station.
Now I grew up, Tony.
- They saw you and another ten people.
Why not discuss this controversial situation in the room ...
I have not heard a better offer.
Bill.
I can not stand ...
- Give me the card.
In you is.
Check.
- Not me.
I found it.
It's not.
- Right now ...
Give it to me.
Tony ...
Count to two hundred and four till I get out!
(DARA) According to the customers of my father, with long ties romance always ends with the same result.
Expectations 1000 points, performance - 0.
Tony!
Or two zeros.
(DARA) They say that who is looking, usually find ...
What about drinking?
Sorry.
Do you know her?
... though not always exactly what I was looking for.
This is my sister.
Leah.
She looks like Keira Knightley.
Without the voice in December Make me unclog ears.
(DARA) Keira Knightley?
And you know that snoring at night and up to 10 class-wetting?
... MY music in your mind MY music in your mind ...
Wow!
- I'll go congratulate her on track.
(DARA) I can not believe it.
I waited Bobby an eternity in the garden, and to Leah for two minutes to steal it.
Bobby.
- Leah.
Sabine cool.
- Thanks. 'Tis was a compliment ?
Go out, faggot ...
- Please?
(DARA) Beat me, I love you!
I'm not sure.
Tony ...
- Yes.
What are you thinking about?
For nothing.
And how can you not think of nothing?
I think we're two people who shit on their love weekend.
And I think they "shout for me" again.
I propose to handle bags and leave now.
I'm better.
- Me too.
I'll wait at the reception.
I can not believe it!
Which?
I drank a few vodkas.
Someday you will show your breasts and for less.
Not my fault that your guy did cast leagues.
You do not even remember his name.
- Nor do I want to tell you cringe.
But u did.
Just as shrinking money from my purse.
Stupid selfish!
Shut up, loser.
- Loser?
Is this the coolest you can think of me?
Better not to had returned.
Girls ...
Tell me that this is a joke.
Because if not, you need together to say prayers.
Sometimes We think that the bad stories, that happen to others, will not happen to us.
Because they are full of mistakes that we will not do.
And yet we are wrong.
We went to the pizza and did not let the alarm.
I'll call SDI.
But if lucky, can others take the blame of us.
Hi, Alexander.
Although personal mistakes, we have to pay personally.
I told you that I do not work on Sunday?
- You are not in the mood?
No, I'm not.
Last night they robbed the house.
Details?
- I can not share with clients.
If you are alone therapy will be not.
- Relax, this time lead and company.
It's therapist.
The best.
Yasmina Mihajlovic.
- Anton Vasilev.
Married about seventeen years.
It has science and experience.
I'm sure this is our guy.
Previously on Ray Donovan...
I know you want me.
I know you want to be with me.
You out of your fucking mind?
- You followed me?
- Fucking right I did.
She's gonna tell Dad.
If she does, he'll kill him.
And maybe he deserves it?
If anyone lays a hand on him, you will never fucking see me again.
That did not happen.
- I ain't fucking senile.
- Fine.
You're not senile.
Go tell Joe Friday out there that you want to wear a wire and get your brains blown out in Long Beach.
You want out?
There is no out.
Ow!
You got to leave L.A.
You tricked their beloved grandfather into signing away his rights, or you're the kind of son that dumps his demented old man in a nursing home.
Either way...
they're gonna hate ya.
Unless you want to go to jail, you'll do exactly what we agreed to.
Andrew Finney was in three hours ago telling the Chief of Police you killed the guy.
- Has he been arrested?
- I do know they're gonna want to talk to you before they charge him.
You're going down for the one fucking murder you didn't commit.
I mean, that's divine retribution.
Where's the poker?
Fuck yourself, you Irish piece of shit.
Ahh!
God!
Where's the poker?
Ray Donovan, we have a warrant to search the premises.
Tell the truth and get it all.
Who knows, you play your cards right, you might even keep the team.
Why would your father kill your husband?
They were lovers.
Anyone see you come in?
No.
I took the service entrance.
I'll wait downstairs.
Stay here.
Keep out of the shit show for a while.
I'll get your PR people to come by tomorrow.
There are more helicopters outside my dad's house than when OJ took the white Bronco down the 405.
Yeah.
How they love to see the mighty fall.
You did the right thing, Paige.
Do you think that's a comfort?
I don't know.
Key's on the counter.
You know, my father never would have killed Varick if you weren't around.
He fell in love with the idea that there was always gonna be someone there to save him from himself.
I'll have my girl check on you in the morning.
Are you sure you can't stay?
Santa Monica.
By the pier.
I'll be at the Paradise Inn.
Please hurry.
I'm really scared.
Bridget?
Bridget?
Bridge?
Baby, wake up.
Nene, wake up.
Mm.
I want to play.
Come on.
I want to play.
What are you doing?
Don't you fucking speak without my permission.
Oh, shit.
- Oh!
- Disobey me, you mariquita?
Did you call me a margarita?
Say you're sorry, motherfucker, or I'll pull it off.
- I'm...
I'm sorry.
- Huh?
Louder.
I'm sorry.
- I bet you are.
- Ah.
Oh.
Happy?
Yeah.
Then get up.
We're going out.
It's the middle of the night.
I'm taking you somewhere.
Come on.
Pants on, bitch.
You're not gonna want to miss this.
All in all, plenty of sunshine and really clear skies.
This is Darby Jackson with your Southern California daily weather.
Now, back to tonight's top story.
Police were dispatched to media mogul Andrew Finney's
Bel Air estate just hours ago after hearing reports of a fire burning on the property.
When investigators arrived at the scene, they discovered that the blaze contained the remains...
Raymond.
...of an unidentified adult male.
Sources are currently saying the victim may have been an employee of the Finney organi...
Where is everybody?
Conor's at a friend's house, and, uh...
Abby's out looking for Bridget.
Why is she looking for Bridget?
Sit down... there's something I got to tell ya.
Bridget got involved with someone at school.
Who?
Her math teacher.
What the fuck are you talking about?
How'd you know they were his drugs?
Well, we found the bottle in her purse, and the prescription had his name on it.
Are ya all right?
How long have you known about this?
A few days.
Few days, huh?
Yeah, we talked about it, and...
You're not my kid's father, Terry.
No, but we thought it was all under control.
You keep fucking saying "we." Wh... you and Abby?
Huh?
What's going on, Terry?
You got a little crush on my wife?
I know you're fucked up in the head, but don't get confused about that, all right?
I'm not the one that's confused, Ray.
You're the one that don't get it.
Don't get what?
It's a disgrace the way you treat her.
You're out all night.
You're cheating like the old man did.
- What?
- Yeah, you heard what I said!
Stop it.
Just both of you fucking stop it.
Why'd you keep this from me?
Because I knew you'd go fucking nuts.
That's not your decision to make.
She's my fucking daughter.
I know how you handle things.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
It means you have problems with shit like this.
Oh, yeah?
Until you come face-to-face with something ugly and you need me to make it go away.
I think what Abby's trying to say...
Do I need you to tell me what my fucking wife is saying, huh?
You got some kind of inside line?
No, he's just been here helping me while you've been out chasing Paige Finney.
Fuck you.
I want you to pack your shit and get out of here before I'm back.
You're not going anywhere.
It's not your decision.
Where's he live?
What?
The teacher.
Where does he live?
He's not home.
I was just there.
Where does he live, Abby?
Tell him.
_
_
_
That was wrong.
I shouldn't have talked to him like that.
He needed to hear it.
I'm glad you said it.
It's her.
She's at Mickey's.
You've been out all night.
I'll go get her.
- I'll come with you.
- No.
No.
I don't want Ray thinking that we are acting as a team.
Now, when your husband comes back, you are gonna talk and you're gonna fix things.
Yeah?
She's at Mickey's.
Terry went to go pick her up.
I'll meet him there.
You didn't have to be so hard on him.
He didn't do anything wrong.
Ray, you there?
Yeah.
Look, just tell him you didn't mean it.
Tell him you don't want him to leave.
Otherwise he'll pack his bags, and he'll never come back.
Is that what you want?
Ray?
I'll talk to him.
Oh.
My beautiful, beautiful boy.
I missed you so much.
Bring Davros some mantee.
Prison food is shit.
You want some bread and pickles with that?
Nah.
It's true what Vartan said about Mickey?
Nothing is ever easy.
Hmm.
Mmm, it's good.
They put enough sumac for once.
I'm sorry I stole the car.
Uh, I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
I'm not worth it.
My own mother hates me.
Six, one thousand.
Seven, one thousand.
Eight, one thousand.
Nine, one thousand.
Ten, one thousand.
All right, ready or not, here I come.
One, two, three, the coke shuffle.
You clever girls.
Wonder where it could be.
It's not over here.
Doesn't seem to be over here.
Oh, look what I found!
I found it.
You found coke?
Don't move.
Oh, fuck you, Ray.
All right, now it's yours.
Go ahead.
- I'm counting?
- Here's a straw.
- You count, you guys hide.
- You're it.
- I'm hiding it.
- You guys are hiding.
Now, we hide it.
Oh.
Oh, time out.
I got to take this.
Ahh.
Hello, sweetie pie.
You all right?
I'm scared to go home.
I told my mother that I'm at your apartment.
Oh?
What happened?
Dad found out about my new boyfriend, and he's gonna hurt him.
Can you please tell them that I'm there with you?
Oh, if I do that, he'd come right over.
Come back and bite ya.
Forget it.
Never mind.
Are you okay?
No, I'm not.
It's not okay.
My dad found out, and he's gonna hurt you.
Okay, Bridget, slow down.
You don't know him, okay?
He can be a very dangerous person.
We need to leave Los Angeles.
Leave Los Angeles?
Bridget, that's insane.
Well, then you need to stay here with me.
In a hotel room with you?
Yeah, that's gonna calm everyone down.
Okay, come on.
Let's just...
let's go for a walk.
Okay?
We'll think of something.
I don't think you're supposed to walk in the woods at night.
Who says?
There's snakes and coyotes and shit.
Pshh.
They fuck with us, they'll have a problem.
Well, how do you even know about this place?
We used to smoke weed out here when I was in high school.
This is where I lost my virginity.
I didn't know Mexicans hiked.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't just fucking say that.
Terry!
What's going on, baby?
Where's Bridget?
What?
What do you mean?
Why would Bridget be here?
Terry!
Come on in.
Take your pants off.
Is Bridget with you?
I don't think so.
♪ Show and tell
♪ Just a game I play...
Oh, shit.
What's up, man?
Abby, I'm at Mick's.
She's not here.
She must have lied.
She called me.
I'll call you back.
- She called me.
- When?
A few minutes ago.
Wanted me to cover for her.
Something about Ray not liking her new boyfriend.
You should have told us, Mick.
You don't sit on shit like that.
I can call her.
See if she'll pick up for me.
See if I can meet her somewhere.
♪ That can't help calling your name... ♪
She ain't answering.
♪ Tell me that you feel the same... ♪
Shit!
Mick, get down!
Aah!
Bridget!
Bridget!
Ray!
Ray!
- Bridget!
- Michelle's dead!
She's dead!
They killed Michelle.
- Ray, they shot her, man.
- Michelle's dead!
- Where the fuck's my daughter?
- She's not here, Ray!
- Where is she?
- She's not here, man.
Bridget!
They're gone, Ray.
Ray.
Ohh.
Terry's shot.
Terry's been shot, Ray.
Oh, fuck.
Come on, Ter.
Look at me, Terry.
Terry, can you hear me?
What happened?
What happened?
Oh, fuck.
We got to get him to the hospital, Ray.
Can you move, Ter?
- Terry.
- Look at me.
Look at me.
Stay awake.
Come on.
- Lift him up.
- Up!
Ah!
All right, get his leg.
Come on.
Come on, Terry.
Let's go.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
You, we need help!
Over here.
Get over here.
Nurse!
Come on, Terry.
Wake up, Ter.
Hey!
There you go.
There you go.
Stay awake.
Surgeon to the bay, please.
Stay awake, Terry.
I mean it, keep your eyes open.
Get me a priest.
You don't need a fucking priest.
You keep your eyes open.
Get me a priest.
Stay back here please.
Your brother has experienced massive hypovolemia.
It means he's lost most of the blood in his body.
There are two arteries in the abdomen called the mesenteric arteries.
Judging from the blood loss, at least one of Terry's is ruptured.
Now, the plan is to perform a series of transfusions during the surgery using universal donor blood to try to keep his heart beating while we do our best to stop the bleeding.
Mr. Donovan?
Your brother will be in surgery for several hours.
We'll check in with you as soon as we know anything.
What'd you find out?
Two of the Minassians got busted on the docks after you pulled Mickey from the sting.
And they blame him.
Well, the APS has a process for informers.
They call it "cutting the tree."
They go after every family member, Ray.
Stay at the office.
I'll call you later.
How bad is it?
What are the doctors saying?
He's still in surgery.
Jesus Christ.
I sent him over there.
Don't do that.
He did it for me, and I fucking let him, Ray.
Abs, stop.
I got too close to him.
Am I responsible for this?
You're the last person who's responsible for this.
Here.
What the hell happened, Mickey?
Gangs.
Turf war.
Wrong place, wrong time, I guess.
Wrong place, wrong time?
We both know who that bullet was meant for.
What the fuck does that mean?
Nothing.
Ray, those Minassians aren't gonna stop.
We need to do something.
Let me make something absolutely fucking clear to you.
We are not doing anything.
Where you going?
I gotta take care of something.
So your father wants to kill me,
I'm gonna lose my job, my teaching credentials, maybe have to register as a sex offender, because apparently, no matter what actually happened, I'm guilty.
It's like a Kafka novel.
Hannah Montana.
- What?
- You.
Your man want to buy you a bracelet?
You don't have to.
I mean, it's...
Sure.
True love.
Right on.
A souvenir to remember the night your math teacher lost his job.
If they're gonna blame you for being with me, why not just be with me?
You all right, kiddo?
You know, I didn't even know her real last name, Pop.
It's Kravitz.
I didn't even know that, Pop.
- Daryll...
- No.
It's cool.
It's cool.
Everything they got from SID.
Okay, I'll go talk to the manager.
Officer, uh, I got nothing to wear.
No stores are open, and, uh, when I made my statement, they said I could grab a change of clothes.
Come on.
Only touch what I tell you to.
Sure.
I feel 100% better.
Do you think I could grab a little something to eat?
I'm starving.
You got 30 seconds.
Okay, thank you.
You know, just need a little something.
Dessert.
Wow.
That's something, huh?
You never been up here, huh?
No.
Nah.
And how long have you lived in L.A.?
Long time, but...
I don't like the woods.
That's gonna have to change, Brendan.
Kids need to get out in nature.
You put a fucking baby in me.
What?
What?
You're not happy?
Um, how'd it happen so quick?
You were firing real bullets, Brendan.
That's gonna be your fucking reaction?
I just...
Say something good.
I can't fucking believe you.
Okay.
I'm coming in the side door.
You take the front door.
You hear me open fire, you don't stop shooting.
Yeah?
So Bridget turned her phone off and took her SIM card out, but Donellen didn't, so I tracked him to Santa Monica.
Is she with him?
I don't know yet.
All right.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on.
Always in the middle of everything, this fucking guy!
You got some balls coming around here.
Fuck.
Let's go.
Come on, Avi.
Avi!
Aah!
You think this is over?
You think you can kill my boys and it stops?
This will never stop.
You are dead.
All of you are dead.
Your children are dead.
Fuck you, and fuck you, and fuck...
And fuck you.
Jesus fucking Christ.
This water old?
Ahh.
Want a sip?
Yeah?
You find her?
No, but there's a motel here.
Let me talk to the clerk.
Already guilty.
Already guilty.
What... what is it?
- I...
- Um...
I...
Please put this on.
Why?
Just put it back on.
Oh, God.
What am I doing here?
What am I...
what am I doing here?
It's okay.
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, Bridget.
I just...
I just miss her so much.
It's okay.
They're in 215.
What are you doing here?
Take him to the hospital.
Come on, Mick.
- He ain't coming?
- Nope.
- Daddy, no!
- Wait, wait...
Do you like kids, you piece of shit?
Huh?
Stop it!
Aah!
You go near my daughter again, I'll cut your fucking hands off.
You understand me?
Get up.
Get away from me.
Get up, Bridget.
We're going.
I'm so sorry.
Ow!
Leave me alone!
I fucking hate you!
Let go!
Dad, let go!
What the fuck is the matter with you?
- Huh?
- I don't know.
What is it?
You having second thoughts about me?
You want to call this shit off, go right ahead.
File papers, whatever.
I was never hurting for a man.
Fucking red hair...
you think that's my thing?
It ain't nothing like that.
Why don't you want to have a baby with me?
'Cause I got no idea how to be a father.
You think I got any idea how to be a mother?
People do it.
We'll figure it out.
Not people like me.
What do you mean people like you?
You know what I mean.
I'm different.
I'm fucked up.
I got news for you, Brendan.
You're not as fucked up as you think you are.
That shit that happened in the past?
Fly away, bye-bye.
It don't touch who you are now.
It don't touch us.
I just don't want to let you down.
What was your mother's name?
Mary.
If it's a girl, we'll call her Maria.
Come on.
Take me out to eat.
I need protein.
He had it coming, Bridge.
You may not realize it now, but you will when you're older.
You don't feel anything, do you?
You say you love me, but you don't.
You say you love Mom, but you don't.
It's like you're not even alive inside.
You think I don't love you?
Bridge, you're my...
You got to know I'd do anything for you.
You control, you don't love.
I'm suffocating being near you, and I don't want to live with that anymore.
Ohh.
Ah.
Daryll, I was worried about ya.
Listen, we took care of business.
We fucking evened the score.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, uh, Pop, I want to show you something.
What's the name?
What's it say?
What do you mean?
The license.
My name.
Daryll Weisbrod.
Yeah, it's funny, 'cause I've always hated that name.
I hated the fact that mom let Allan adopt me because she knew how bad I wanted to be your son.
See, I always wanted to be a Donovan.
Always.
Here, take...
Take the keys.
Take 'em!
There's a reason that Michelle came back.
There's a reason.
- I'm so sorry, Son.
- She...
She brought your car back, so you can get in it and drive away!
Just go.
Hey, Ter.
Hey.
What you said about me... about how I treat the family you were right.
I don't deserve 'em.

He needs a priest.
Why?
What happened?
He got shot.
He's dying.
I'm sorry, Ray.

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been 36 years since my last confession.
I've hurt people.
Been violent all my life.
Caused pain.
Confess your sins.
I killed Father O'Connor.
I shot him in the head.
He begged me for his life, and I shot him.
Will you accept Christ into your life?
I don't know how.
Can you find the Kingdom of God in your heart?
I can't find anything.
I...
I did what you said.
Now...
make it right for him.
Please, just make it... make it right with God for my brother.
But what about you?
- I don't care about me...
- God does.
God cares about you.
I killed him.
All right?
I said what you wanted me to say, so...
Why, Ray?
Why did you do it?
I say I did it.
You say you forgive me.
Why did you do it?
Now you're just putting fucking words in my mouth!
Why did you do it, Ray?
He told me I was smart.
All right?
He took me places.
Bought me things.
And no one else in your life was doing that?
When he started in with me, he said I was special.
He said he saw something in me.
The things he did...
After a while, I stopped fighting him.
Of course you did.
I know how that feels.
You wanted to please him.
No.
It was more than that.
I cared for him.
I did it because I cared for him.
I see these fucking pictures in my head every fucking day!
Every night!
When I hug my kids, I see these fucking pictures!
He shouldn't have done that to you, Ray.
You were just a boy.
I don't need your fucking sympathy.
What do you need?
I need to know my brother's gonna be all right.
I need to know my brother's not gonna die.
I can't tell you that.
Ray... faith is the evidence of things not seen.
You asked God for forgiveness.
That has to be enough.
The rest is out of your control.
May God grant you pardon and peace.
I absolve you of your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

Previously on Ray Donovan...
I know you want me.
I know you want to be with me.
You out of your fucking mind?
- You followed me?
- Fucking right I did.
She's gonna tell Dad.
If she does, he'll kill him.
And maybe he deserves it?
If anyone lays a hand on him, you will never fucking see me again.
That did not happen.
- I ain't fucking senile.
- Fine.
You're not senile.
Go tell Joe Friday out there that you want to wear a wire and get your brains blown out in Long Beach.
You want out?
There is no out.
You t to leave L.A.
You tricked their beloved grandfather into signing away his rights, or you're the kind of son that dumps his demented old man in a nursing home.
Either way...
they're gonna hate ya.
Unless you want to go to jail, you'll do exactly what we agreed to.
Andrew Finney was in three hours ago telling the Chief of Police you killed the guy.
- Has he been arrested?
- I do know they're gonna want to talk to you before they charge him.
You're going down for the one fucking murder you didn't commit.
I mean, that's divine retribution.
Where's the poker?
Fuck yourself, you Irish piece of shit.
God!
Where's the poker?
Ray Donovan, we have a warrant to search the premises.
Tell the truth and get it all.
Who knows, you play your cards right, you might even keep the team.
Why would your father kill your husband?
They were lovers.
Anyone see you come in?
No.
I took the service entrance.
I'll wait downstairs.
Stay here.
Keep out of the shit show for a while.
I'll get your PR people to come by tomorrow.
There are more helicopters outside my dad's house than when OJ took the white Bronco down the 405.
Yeah.
How they love to see the mighty fall.
You did the right thing, Paige.
Do you think that's a comfort?
I don't know.
Key's on the counter.
You know, my father never would have killed Varick if you weren't around.
He fell in love with the idea that there was always gonna be someone there to save him from himself.
I'll have my girl check on you in the morning.
Are you sure you can't stay?
Santa Monica.
By the pier.
I'll be at the Paradise Inn.
Please hurry.
I'm really scared.
Bridget?
Bridget?
Bridge?
Baby, wake up.
Nene, wake up.
I want to play.
Come on.
I want to play.
What are you doing?
Don't you fucking speak without my permission.
Oh, shit.
Disobey me, you mariquita?
Did you call me a margarita?
Say you're sorry, motherfucker, or I'll pull it off.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
Louder.
I'm sorry.
I bet you are.
Happy?
Yeah.
Then get up.
We're going out.
It's the middle of the night.
I'm taking you somewhere.
Come on.
Pants on, bitch.
You're not gonna want to miss this.
All in all, plenty of sunshine and really clear skies.
This is Darby Jackson with your Southern California daily weather.
Now, back to tonight's top story.
Police were dispatched to media mogul Andrew Finney's
Bel Air estate just hours ago after hearing reports of a fire burning on the property.
When investigators arrived at the scene, they discovered that the blaze contained the remains...
Raymond.
...of an unidentified adult male.
Sources are currently saying the victim may have been an employee of the Finney organi...
Where is everybody?
Conor's at a friend's house, and, uh...
Abby's out looking for Bridget.
Why is she looking for Bridget?
Sit down... there's something I got to tell ya.
Bridget got involved with someone at school.
Who?
Her math teacher.
What the fuck are you talking about?
How'd you know they were his drugs?
Well, we found the bottle in her purse, and the prescription had his name on it.
Are ya all right?
How long have you known about this?
A few days.
Few days?
Yeah, we talked about it, and...
You're not my kid's father, Terry.
No, but we thought it was all under control.
You keep fucking saying "we." Wh... you and Abby?
What's going on, Terry?
You got a little crush on my wife?
I know you're fucked up in the head, but don't get confused about that, all right?
I'm not the one that's confused, Ray.
You're the one that don't get it.
Don't get what?
It's a disgrace the way you treat her.
You're out all night.
You're cheating like the old man did.
- What?
- Yeah, you heard what I said!
Stop it.
Just both of you fucking stop it.
Why'd you keep this from me?
Because I knew you'd go fucking nuts.
That's not your decision to make.
She's my fucking daughter.
I know how you handle things.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
It means you have problems with shit like this.
Oh, yeah?
Until you come face-to-face with something ugly and you need me to make it go away.
I think what Abby's trying to say...
Do I need you to tell me what my fucking wife is saying?
You got some kind of inside line?
No, he's just been here helping me while you've been out chasing Paige Finney.
Fuck you.
I want you to pack your shit and get out of here before I'm back.
You're not going anywhere.
It's not your decision.
Where's he lives?
What?
The teacher.
Where does he lives?
He's not home.
I was just there.
Where does he live, Abby?
Tell him.
INCOMING CALL DAD
MESSAGING:
THREADS MOM:
WHERE ARE YOU, BRIDGET?
DON'T WORRY, I'M AT GRANDPA'S
That was wrong.
I shouldn't have talked to him like that.
He needed to hear it.
I'm glad you said it.
It's her.
She's at Mickey's.
You've been out all night.
I'll go get her.
- I'll come with you.
- No.
No.
I don't want Ray thinking that we are acting as a team.
Now, when your husband comes back, you are gonna talk and you're gonna fix things.
Yeah?
She's at Mickey's.
Terry went to go pick her up.
I'll meet him there.
You didn't have to be so hard on him.
He didn't do anything wrong.
Ray, you there?
Yeah.
Look, just tell him you didn't mean it.
Tell him you don't want him to leave.
Otherwise he'll pack his bags, and he'll never come back.
Is that what you want?
Ray?
I'll talk to him.
My beautiful, beautiful boy.
I missed you so much.
Bring Davros some mantee.
Prison food is shit.
You want some bread and pickles with that?
Nah.
It's true what Vartan said about Mickey?
Nothing is ever easy.
It's good.
They put enough sumac for once.
I'm sorry I stole the car.
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
I'm not worth it.
My own mother hates me.
Six, one thousand.
Seven, one thousand.
Eight, one thousand.
Nine, one thousand.
Ten, one thousand.
All right, ready or not, here I come.
One, two, three, the coke shuffle.
You clever girls.
Wonder where it could be.
It's not over here.
Doesn't seem to be over here.
Oh, look what I found!
I found it.
You found coke?
Don't move.
Oh, fuck you, Ray.
All right, now it's yours.
Go ahead.
- I'm counting?
- Here's a straw.
- You count, you guys hide.
- You're it.
- I'm hiding it.
- You guys are hiding.
Now, we hide it.
Oh, time out.
I got to take this.
Hello, sweetie pie.
You all right?
I'm scared to go home.
I told my mother that I'm at your apartment.
What happened?
Dad found out about my new boyfriend, and he's gonna hurt him.
Can you please tell them that I'm there with you?
Oh, if I do that, he'd come right over.
Come back and bite ya.
Forget it.
Never mind.
Are you okay?
No, I'm not.
It's not okay.
My dad found out, and he's gonna hurt you.
Okay, Bridget, slow down.
You don't know him, okay?
He can be a very dangerous person.
We need to leave Los Angeles.
Leave Los Angeles?
Bridget, that's insane.
Well, then you need to stay here with me.
In a hotel room with you?
Yeah, that's gonna calm everyone down.
Okay, come on.
Let's just...
let's go for a walk.
Okay?
We'll think of something.
I don't think you're supposed to walk in the woods at night.
Who says?
There's snakes and coyotes and shit.
They fuck with us, they'll have a problem.
Well, how do you even know about this place?
We used to smoke weed out here when I was in high school.
This is where I lost my virginity.
I didn't know Mexicans hiked.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't just fucking say that.
Terry!
What's going on, baby?
Whers Bridget?
What?
What do you mean?
Why would Bridget be here?
Terry!
Come on in.
Take your pants off.
Is Bridget with you?
I don't think so.
Oh, shit.
What's up, man?
Abby, I'm at Mick's.
She's not here.
She must have lied.
She called me.
I'll call you back.
- She called me.
- When?
A few minutes ago.
Wanted me to cover for her.
Something about Ray not liking her new boyfriend.
You should have told us, Mick.
You don't sit on shit like that.
I can call her.
See if she'll pick up for me.
See if I can meet her somewhere.
She ain't answering.
Shit!
Mick, get down!
Bridget!
Bridget!
Ray!
Ray!
- Bridget!
- Michelle's dead!
She's dead!
They killed Michelle.
- Ray, they shot her, man.
- Michelle's dead!
- Where the fuck's my daughter?
- She's not here, Ray!
- Where is she?
- She's not here, man.
Bridget!
They're gone, Ray.
Ray.
Terry's shot.
Terry's been shot, Ray.
Oh, fuck.
Come on, Ter.
Look at me, Terry.
Terry, can you hear me?
What happened?
What happened?
Oh, fuck.
We got to get him to the hospital, Ray.
Can you move, Ter?
- Terry.
- Look at me.
Look at me.
Stay awake.
Come on.
- Lift him up.
- Up!
All right, get his leg.
Come on.
Come on, Terry.
Let's go.
ST.
MATTHEW MEDICAL CENTER EMERGENCY
You, we need help!
Over here.
Get over here.
Nurse!
Come on, Terry.
Wake up, Ter.
Hey!
There you go.
There you go.
Stay awake.
Surgeon to the bay, please.
Stay awake, Terry.
I mean it, keep your eyes open.
Get me a priest.
You don't need a fucking priest.
You keep your eyes open.
Get me a priest.
Stay back here please.
Your brother has experienced massive hypovolemia.
It means he's lost most of the blood in his body.
There are two arteries in the abdomen called the mesenteric arteries.
Judging from the blood loss, at least one of Terry's is ruptured.
Now, the plan is to perform a series of transfusions during the surgery using universal donor blood to try to keep his heart beating while we do our best to stop the bleeding.
Mr. Donovan?
Your brother will be in surgery for several hours.
We'll check in with you as soon as we know anything.
What'd you find out?
Two of the Minassians got busted on the docks after you pulled Mickey from the sting.
And they blame him.
Well, the APS has a process for informers.
They call it "cutting the tree."
They go after every family member, Ray.
Stay at the office.
I'll call you later.
How bad is it?
What are the doctors saying?
He's still in surgery.
Jesus Christ.
I sent him over there.
Don't do that.
He did it for me, and I fucking let him, Ray.
Abs, stop.
I got too close to him.
Am I responsible for this?
You're the last person who's responsible for this.
Here.
What the hell happened, Mickey?
Gangs.
Turf war.
Wrong place, wrong time, I guess.
Wrong place, wrong time?
We both know who that bullet was meant for.
What the fuck does that mean?
Nothing.
Ray, those Minassians aren't gonna stop.
We need to do something.
Let me make something absolutely fucking clear to you.
We are not doing anything.
Where you going?
I gotta take care of something.
So your father wants to kill me,
I'm gonna lose my job, my teaching credentials, maybe have to register as a sex offender, because apparently, no matter what actually happened, I'm guilty.
It's like a Kafka novel.
Hannah Montana.
- What?
- You.
Your man want to buy you a bracelet?
You don't have to.
I mean, it's...
Sure.
True love.
Right on.
A souvenir to remember the night your math teacher lost his job.
If they're gonna blame you for being with me, why not just be with me?
You all right, kiddo?
You know, I didn't even know her real last name, Pop.
It's Kravitz.
I didn't even know that, Pop.
- Daryll...
- No.
It's cool.
It's cool.
Everything they got from SID.
Okay, I'll go talk to the manager.
Officer, uh, I got nothing to wear.
No stores are open, and, uh, when I made my statement, they said I could grab a change of clothes.
Come on.
Only touch what I tell you to.
Sure.
I feel 100% better.
Do you think I could grab a little something to eat?
I'm starving.
You got 30 seconds.
Okay, thank you.
You know, just need a little something.
Dessert.
Wow.
That's something?
You never been up here?
No.
Nah.
And how long have you lived in L.A.?
Long time, but...
I don't like the woods.
That's gonna have to change, Brendan.
Kids need to get out in nature.
You put a fucking baby in me.
What?
What?
You're not happy?
How'd it happen so quick?
You were firing real bullets, Brendan.
That's gonna be your fucking reaction?
I just...
Say something good.
I can't fucking believe you.
Okay.
I'm coming in the side door.
You take the front door.
You hear me open fire, you don't stop shooting.
Yeah?
So Bridget turned her phone off and took her SIM card out, but Donellen didn't, so I tracked him to Santa Monica.
Is she with him?
I don't know yet.
All right.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on.
Always in the middle of everything, this fucking guy!
You got some balls coming around here.
Fuck.
Let's go.
Come on, Avi.
Avi!
You think this is over?
You think you can kill my boys and it stops?
This will never stop.
You are dead.
All of you are dead.
Your children are dead.
Fuck you, and fuck you, and fuck...
And fuck you.
Jesus fucking Christ.
This water old?
Want a sip?
Yeah?
You find her?
No, but there's a motel here.
Let me talk to the clerk.
Already guilty.
Already guilty.
What... what is it?
I...
I...
Please put this on.
Why?
Just put it back on.
Oh, God.
What am I doing here?
What am I...
what am I doing here?
It's okay.
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, Bridget.
I just...
I just miss her so much.
It's okay.
They're in 215.
What are you doing here?
Take him to the hospital.
Come on, Mick.
- He ain't coming?
- Nope.
- Daddy, no!
- Wait, wait...
Do you like kids, you piece of shit?
Stop it!
You go near my daughter again, I'll cut your fucking hands off.
You understand me?
Get up.
Get away from me.
Get up, Bridget.
We're going.
I'm so sorry.
Leave me alone!
I fucking hate you!
Let go!
Dad, let go!
What the fuck is the matter with you?
I don't know.
What is it?
You having second thoughts about me?

He told me I was smart.
All right?
He took me places.
Bought me things.
And no one else in your life was doing that?
When he started in with me, he said I was special.
He said he saw something in me.
The things he did...
After a while, I stopped fighting him.
Of course you did.
I know how that feels.
You wanted to please him.
No.
It was more than that.
I cared for him.
I did it because I cared for him.
I see these fucking pictures in my head every fucking day!
Every night!
When I hug my kids, I see these fucking pictures!
He shouldn't have done that to you, Ray.
You were just a boy.
I don't need your fucking sympathy.
What do you need?
I need to know my brother's gonna be all right.
I need to know my brother's not gonna die.
I can't tell you that.
Ray... faith is the evidence of things not seen.
You asked God for forgiveness.
That has to be enough.
The rest is out of your control.
May God grant you pardon and peace.
I absolve you of your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

You may not realize it now, but you will when you're older.
You don't feel anything, do you?
You say you love me, but you don't.
You say you love Mom, but you don't.
It's like you're not even alive inside.
You think I don't love you?
Bridge, you're my...
You got to know I'd do anything for you.
You control, you don't love.
I'm suffocating being near you, and I don't want to live with that anymore.
Ohh.

What's the name?

What do you mean?
The license.
My name.
Daryll Weisbrod.
Yeah, it's funny, 'cause I've always hated that name.
I hated the fact that mom let Allan adopt me because she knew how bad I wanted to be your son.
See, I always wanted to be a Donovan.
Always.

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been 36 years since my last confession.
I've hurt people.
Been violent all my life.
Caused pain.
[Romero] Confess your sins.
I killed Father O'Connor.
I shot him in the head.
He begged me for his life, and I shot him.
Will you accept Christ into your life?
I don't know how.
Can you find the Kingdom of God in your heart?
I can't find anything.
I...
I did what you said.
Now...
make it right for him.
Please, just make it... make it right with God for my brother.

Bought me things.
And no one else in your life was doing that?

After a while, I stopped fighting him.
Of course you did.

No.

You have no signal.
Here.
Look.
You need a signal.
Otherwise you walk a few steps or you climb.
And there's a problem or you think there's a problem
-you call me, understand?
-Alright, boss.
-Day or night.
-Okay, boss.
Samuel...
Haven't you ever got the feeling that what's happening isn't really happening?
My husband...
Angus thinks I have got a lot of rubbish in my head.
That was just beautiful, Mattis.
That was just beautiful!
I forgot my purse in my room.
Next time...
It's all the same for him!
What'd he do with money, anyway?
I don't understand french!
That's it, dad.
I've brought them all in.
A gift.
From Angus's wife.
For us?
-Dad?
-What?
Do you like dogs?
Everybody likes dogs.
Even stray dogs?
I threw a rock at a dog today.
Samuel?
I just heated some coffee.
No, thank you, I'm in a hurry.
I need extra men to reinforce the fencing tomorrow morning.
I'll come by and get you at six.
Almighty God, our Father in heaven, watch over us.
Guide me towards a good job where I may fulfill our needs.
Almighty Benefactor, in your mercy protect our rosebushes and make them grow.
Waldo...
You have to pray with your eyes closed.
-Amen.
-Amen.
I'm offering 40 rands a day.
This...
Five...
You have 30 rands, 40 cents and you need 300!
Okay, okay, look. 300, alright?
300 and you come back.
Your brother doesn't have to be informed about the custody.
But your father must come here and sign it!
Next person!
There is two in this one.
A big one and a little one!
The big one is a weed.
It's hard to tell the difference.
I'll teach you.
Should I pull it out?
Let's wait a bit longer to be on the safe side.
Even just a little bit will be enough for the tests.
I've been holding it in since yesterday.
You should have asked Estelle.
It's hard to ask your daughter to do something like that.
Angus is a lucky man!
A pretty bride from the city!
God does not exist...
I've made a new friend.
He's going to help me with Mattis' custody.
Are you jealous?
Men are so predictable.
What's a poor girl supposed to do?
Change your clothes.
Dinner will be ready in five minutes.
Tonight is an extra special night.
What are we celebrating?
Good money and even more pay.
Go on, you're wet!
Dinner will be ready in five minutes!
Wait until you see the roses.
I'm starving!
Let's taste all three.
We'll plant some ivy in the empty grass jars.
And give it away for free with the purchase of two rosebushes.
Pure figue.
Maybe we could sell the ivy too?
But if we give away a free ivy, with two rosebushes, they'll be tempted to buy two instead of one.
Dad?
My secret tunnel is going to be one kilometer long.
Your secret tunnel, hey!
?
-You don't believe me, do you?
-Of course I believe you.
It's for real.
I've beaten down the sugar canes this wide across.
It's going to go all the way to the river.
Fuck!
Keep the meat.
I bought a bicycle today.
With my own money.
The jackals attacked the herd tonight.
They ripped a pregnant ewe to shreds.
It was still alive when I got there.
They'd eaten its fetus.
They'd rip a man to shreds if they get the chance.
Get someone to drive you if you need to wander around.
Bicycles aren't an option.
The cat had her kittens last night.
You'll have to put them down.
I'll ask Samuel.
No.
Samuel is coming with me today.
You'll have to manage on your own.
What happened to Samuel's wife?
Long story...
A gang from the township drowned two white women from the Catholic Mission for revenge...
She was a french nurse...
I need more men.
Keep as much meat as you like and burn the rest.
Samuel, come with me, we're going to take a look around.
What an idea asking me?
!
I can give you 50 rands.
You can treat yourself...
Buy yourself a new dress.
What do I need a new dress for?
!
All right.
I'll make a plan, I'll find somebody.
Just leave the box on the table.
Thank you.
I do it for you.
You're good with people.
We'll track them down.
I'll trap one that will lead us to the others...
I'll kill them one by one!
Tell me if it hurts.
Okay?
Nobody seems to care about anything here.
I had to get rid of a litter of kittens this morning.
I asked Mrs Borgman...
There is this painting on her outside wall:
The eleven of...
Lady Grey.
How is that?
You'll feel quite well in our place.
I grew up here.
My son was born here...
Your wife?
She was one of the two french nurses, right?
They never found her body in the river...
She doesn't have no grave.
Same as the eleven of Lady Grey.
Never found their bodies.
But someone must know, don't you think?
Kids like meat!
Is it better?
Much better.
Thank you...
For working?
Tomorrow'll be alright.
Should I still cook the beans?
-Hello.
-Hello.
Hello, everybody.
We have to disconnect your electricity.
You haven't paid for the last four months.
I need a signature.
You really don't like me, do you?
I've just brewed some coffee.
Why don't you come in?
No thanks, we've got work to do.
Get out of here!
Get the fuck out of here!
Fuck off!
Get out of here!
Fuck off!
It's okay.
Don't worry, Waldo.
Everything's okay.
I'm not worried.
I'm not worried.
Are you okay?
How's your hand?
It's okay.
We burn all around in the spring.
It's all green again...
Your coin isn't worth anything.
Not worth anything.
Okay, okay, okay.
Look, look.
I give you 50 cents for your coin, okay?
50 cents.
I'm trying to catch some flies for fishing.
I forgot they cut off the electricity.
Listen.
When we don't hear any more coins clink in the box, that'll mean there are enough bills in here to pay for the electricity.
Okay?
Waldo?
Where are you going?
Waldo!
Waldo!
You don't think I do this for the fun of it, do you?
Maybe I do...
Sometimes...
You know what it means to be different?
One day they tell you:
"Now your father is white."
It makes you different, no?
Not all black.
People are so anxious for things to be black or white.
Let me stay.
Are you sure you've never had a child with a black woman?
You have to go now.
Go on.
What you asked me about...
I don't know... sometimes...
I've been... wild... like an animal.
Take care of the rosebushes.
Amen.
Amen.
I remember when mummy and I watched you fishing.
I remember you caught a blue trout with your hands.
A blue trout, that's right.
A big blue trout.
Just with your bare hands.
I remember the river was green.
What a memory you have.
Green and silent.
And me and mummy watched you fishing in the green river.
You don't need a nursing degree to give him a wash.
That's what I pay you for, isn't it?
Here.
A week in advance.
I was thinking of the river today.
I was trying to remember how many blue trout
I'd caught by hand that day.
Do you remember?
Don't leave me alone.
The silence is toxic.
In this country...
-Bring them inside.
-Nobody's there, sir.
Store room.
Thank you.
People were talking at the vigil.
They said things about Angus.
I don't know.
I wish my mother were among the three coffins...
Is your father in?
No.
He's got some work at the mission.
What are you doing?
I'm putting the rosebushes outside.
Rosebushes?
They look like weeds.
Well, we all learn by our mistakes, don't we?
The boy's father said you can have it back now...
Who is he?
I don't know...
I only saw the boy.
Where does this boy live?
I don't know...
He ran away...
You should have stopped him!
He said... his brothers have a grave, you can have the ring back...
Why didn't you stop him?
-I couldn't!
-Why?
Why?
Why?
What's your problem with me?
-Please...
-Go away!
Go away!
We're going out to a restaurant tonight.
I told you, didn't I?
I told you we'd get rich fast.
Tonight we celebrate and treat ourselves.
We're going out to a restaurant.
We'll pay for the electricity with the money from the rosebushes.
Pick out something from the dessert menu.
I'm fine.
I've had enough.
Boss!
Biscuit and chocolate pudding for the young man.
My round!
Beers for everyone!
And wine for the young lady.
Look at this!
Lord, bless our souls.
We thank You for the bread and wine we share in the memory of Your body.
Amen!
Amen!
-Thank you, Olive.
-Pleasure.
More beers, guys?
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
Good.
A toast, guys?
To Olive!
Cheers!
From your father.
A round smooth rock... in the river... up to my waist...
I take off my shirt...
A trout swims between my legs...
A blue trout...
In the green river.
Mrs Borgman!
Another one for the road!
I want to go home now.
Boss!
More pudding for the young man.
Dad!
More wine!
Angus says the rosebushes aren't rosebushes.
They're weeds.
You made me eat two desserts.
We spent all the money!
I hate you!
I hate you!
I don't... want you to worry about money.
I'm so proud of you.
Everyone in town congratulates me whenever I talk about you.
You'll never lack of anything.
I'll make sure you never lack of anything.
I promise.
Waldo...
Hop in.
Come on.
It's much too cold to be out walking.
You know me.
I'm Olive's husband.
Olive who looks after your dad.
Your sister Estelle called me.
She asked me to bring you home.
What were you telling the men at the bar?
I could read your lips.
You were telling about the trout, weren't you?
Yes.
No, no.
To tell you the truth,
I don't remember the trout very well.
You were quick.
Did you know where the eleven burned bodies were hidden?
You must have lost it.
Can you explain?
Do you love him?
Do you love me?
(dog barking)
From the tip of your toe through the crown of your head, feel the energy flow.
Ignore the distractions of the world.
(door opens) Hey.
Oh, no, no.
I was almost asleep.
I know.
...fill you with energy...
I could use a nap, too.
(sighs) ...and exhale.
Ah!
How great is it back here?
No tenant.
No kids.
No laundry.
It's paradise.
This could be the beginning of a whole new phase of our lives.
The guest house years.
Hmm...
What if we pretend that, like, we were teenagers... (moans) (chuckles) ...and our parents lived in the main house.
Mm-hmm.
And they might come in at any moment.
So we have to do it really quickly.
LINA:
I'm not finishing my class, am I?
RUSS:
No.
(kissing)
I hear them.
Who?
Your parents.
- Really?
-Yeah.
Are you sure it's not your mother?
No, it's not my mother.
- Really?
- It's your parents.
I think I can hear your mom's heels on the wood floor.
No, it's your parents.
- I think I can hear your mom...
- Stop.
...lighting a cigarette.
Damn it!
(laughing)
That's not cool, okay?
It's not hot at all.
You can finish your class.
Mmm, mission accomplished.
(door closes)
So, we are celebrating, guys.
I did a good deed.
Nobody's gonna ask me what my good deed was?
Pretty sure we're gonna get that information either way.
Mmm.
I'm helping a Webcam girl get off the cam.
I don't understand.
Well, you know those girls who help fellas enjoy the Internet?
I know what a Webcam girl is.
What do you mean you "helped her off the cam"?
I'm paying for her education.
Oh, in exchange for sorority cam.
Nice.
No.
She wants to work with deaf kids.
She may look like a dirty bird, but underneath that rocking bod is a sweet little angel.
How do you manage to make charity seem creepy?
There's nothing creepy about it.
I am trying to help women be happy.
Oh, good luck with that.
What's with him?
What did you do?
Did you finally break my friend here?
This has nothing to do with me.
This is about his mother.
She's coming to stay with us for a couple nights.
(laughs):
Oh, Sharon, huh?
Too bad I'm sober.
She knows how to party.
I'm not sober.
Yeah, well, for Russ, the party ended a long time ago.
RUSS:
I'm just not my best around her.
It's only two nights.
Yeah, but who knows?
I mean, you never get a straight answer with her.
We just got to make it through the weekend without any drama.
Is that all we have to do?
(mouth full):
Mm-hmm.
LINA:
Take that.
They look expensive.
If Grandma sees it, she might ask for money.
Take this wine, put it in my closet with the rest, okay?
Why do we hide things from Grandma?
Sometimes Grandma thinks staying with us is a party.
And she... likes a goodie bag.
- Don't mention the guest house.
- Are you kidding me?
She'd never leave.
- Are you okay?
- No.
Look, it's a few days.
And then she leaves for her cruise.
We just need to feed her, get her drunk.
It'll be fine.
(doorbell rings)
GIRLS:
Grandma!
Hi, you little maniacs.
(smooching)
Oh, there you are.
There's my handsome son.
Come on.
Tell your mommy you love her.
I love you.
Aw.
Oh!
Thank you.
- Hi, Sharon.
- Hi.
How's my favorite daughter-in-law?
(chuckles) Good, really good.
I thought you said you had a nicer house.
We, we do.
But it's still in the Valley.
That's where people live.
No, no.
No, people don't
"live" in the Valley;
they exist.
What's going on?
Are playing or not?
(sighs)
I can't.
Too depressed.
Remember that Webcam girl I was telling you about?
Sure.
She's back on the cam.
So?
"So?"
I registered her for classes.
I bought her textbooks.
I even gave her a stipend.
At least she's in school.
Well, that's the thing.
She didn't even show up for class.
(wry laugh)
What the hell?
When she told me that she wanted to work with deaf kids,
I actually believed her.
(sighs)
The Internet's a web of lies.
I was so proud of myself.
For the first time since I was fired,
I felt like I was doing something positive.
I felt like I was improving the world.
Now... (quiet laugh) she's back on the cam.
Hey.
Could you give me this woman's information?
I'd like to give her a piece of my mind.
I don't like seeing you like this.
SHARON:
Oh, Jesus, what a shithole!
Come on, let's get it cleaned up.
Oh!
Does your mother even know how to dust?
LINA:
I'm right here.
How much was this painting?
I don't remember.
Well, whatever you paid, you paid too much.
Mom, where are you pants?
It's okay.
I'm wearing my underpants.
No, it's not okay.
I-I think what Russ means is that he'd feel more comfortable if-if you wore pants around the house.
Oh, is that what he wants?
That's what he wants.
Then he can speak for himself.
I want you to wear pants.
Don't be such a Republican.
Pants are "Republican"?
I think pants are bipartisan.
Fine.
Tell Mohammed I'll put on my burka.
(scoffs)
(door closes)
Why did you start with her?
Are you kidding?
I'm supposed to let her walk around the house in her panties?
Two days.
Then she goes on her cruise, then she flies back to Cleveland and then she goes back to being your sister's problem.
I know, but I'm not gonna make it.
Fine.
I'll keep you separated.
Sharon?
Can I take you shopping?
SHARON:
Finally!
This won't be cheap.
Buy her some pants.
Are you excited about Mexico?
I'm excited about not paying for it.
Wow, Tina's treating?
That's nice of her.
I'm not going with Tina.
Russ said that, um...
Well, that's what I told him.
He doesn't like to hear about my love life.
Wow.
What do you think?
Who are you going on this cruise with?
An interested senior I met on the Internet.
Oh...
So what's your verdict on the teddy?
Is he getting his money's worth?
I don't know.
How much is the cruise?
The answer is yes, bitch.
(sighs)
RUSS:
So you're going on a cruise with a man you've never met before?
Well, we FaceTimed.
But it wasn't just faces.
(laughs)
Oh, gross, Mom.
What do you even know about this guy?
I know that he's very generous.
Unlike my son and daughter-in-law.
Those cheeses weren't cheap.
Neither was the teddy.
What teddy?
Never mind.
Does Kimmy know that you're going on this trip with a man that you've never met?
I'm done with your sister.
I am never going back to Cleve-bland.
I see.
So then, what happens?
- Where do you go after the cruise?
- Oh.
The interested senior has some property in La Jolla.
Maybe I'll end up there.
That doesn't make any sense.
Well, it would, if you saw the teddy.
_
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.
Sit down.
I already ordered.
All right.
So I had a little Web chat with our friend.
- And?
- And, well, at first, I just pretended to be a regular pervert.
You know?
I asked her to do some light panty play, established trust-- pretty smart, right?
Did you ask her about the deaf school or not?
Yes, I did, and all of a sudden, click-
- I was blocked.
That's it?
You had me drive to Valencia for this?
You could've told me all of that on the phone.
Hang on!
I noticed, on her night stand, a take-out container:
Tandoori chicken...
from Assam Kitchen.
So what?
I heard a nearby train.
I researched all four locations.
This is the only Assam Kitchen near train tracks.
Your plan is to sit here until she comes back to this restaurant and orders more tandoori?
Oh, well.
We tried.
You can't, can't save everyone.
Wait a second.
I think I know how to do this.
Guys?
We're trying to save a life.
And help the deaf, so it's a two-fer.
I'm not home.
AJ:
No, no, no, no.
We need a third.
Of course you do.
Yeah?
RUSS:
My mom's plan is to bone an old stranger until he invites her to live with him.
Do you have a better plan?
Yeah.
Ether, duct tape, shallow grave in the desert...
SHARON:
Oh, there you are.
What's for dinner?
Well, I made tater tots and chicken nuggets for the kids.
What is this, Friendly's?
RUSS:
Mom...
Not okay.
You're a guest.
You're the host?
Lina, can you take me to Crate Barrel?
I need some new pots.
For the cruise?
Forget it;
I cancelled it.
What?
Why?
Ah... guy called me up and asked for my credit card to cover my incidentals.
So you're not going?
Nobody tells me how many margaritas to order.
Who does he think he is, your father?
Oh, wow.
Wow!
I see what this is.
I'm such an idiot.
What?
I was worried about you.
But that's...
what you wanted, right?
That was the plan?
To have me get super-concerned and worried so that I would beg you not to go on the trip.
Right?
Was there ever a cruise, Mom?
Was there ever an interested senior?
You don't think I'm hot enough to get a cruise paid for?
(phone chimes, whistles) Here, look.
Oh, my God, Mom!
SHARON:
Now do you believe me?
That could be any old guy's dick.
Seriously?
You really think that I would go out and steal a picture of any old guy's dick just so I could live here with my asshole son and his joyless wife?
Yep.
Yeah, I do, actually.
I would never live in the Valley.

[Lisa Simone Kelly] My mother was one of the greatest entertainers of all time, hands down... but she paid a huge price.

[interviewer] Good evening.
Our guest tonight is Nina Simone.
Probably the foremost blues singer, jazz singer, singer of all songs in the United States today.
Nina, are you happy with the kind of work you are doing?
[Nina] What makes me the happiest, is when I'm performing and there are people out there who feel with me and I know I touched them.
But to be completely honest, the whole thing seems so much like a dream.
I never thought I was gonna stay in show business.
When I first got into show business,
I wasn't a blues singer and I wasn't even a jazz singer.
I was a classical pianist.
I studied to become the first black classical pianist in America, and that's all that was on my mind.
That's what I was prepared to be.
I was born Eunice Waymon, which is my real name, by the way, in a town called Tryon, North Carolina.
I started to play the piano when I was three or four.
My mother was a preacher and she took me with her on her revivals, and I started to play the piano in church.
["Children Go Where I Send You" playing]
♪ Children go where I send you ♪
♪ How shall I send you?
♪
♪ I'm gonna send you one by one ♪
♪ One for the little biddy baby was born, born, born in Bethlehem ♪
Revival meetings were some of the most exciting times that I've ever had.
The music was so intense, you just sort of went out of yourself.
I felt it tremendously.
I was leading it.
When I was seven, the choir of our church gave a program at the local theater, and I was on that program...
And I played some song, I don't remember what it was, and these two women, two white women, in the audience heard me.
One of them was the woman that my mother worked for, and the other one was a music teacher, Mrs. Mazzanovich, and they decided right then and there to give me lessons.
And so, for five years after that,
I studied piano, classical piano, with this teacher.
I crossed the railroad tracks every weekend to get to Mrs. Mazzanovich.
And, you know, railroad tracks in the South are supposed to be dividing the blacks from the whites.
Well, it really did.
I was so scared.
Mrs. Mazzanovich frightened me.
It was her being white, in the sense that I had never seen.
She was alien to me.
Her white hair, the combs in it, her pleasantness...
I loved that.
And she started me on Bach.
And this Bach, I liked him.
Mrs. Mazzanovich had it in her mind that I was gonna be one of the world's greatest concert pianists.
So it was all very disciplined classical music.
Bach, Beethoven, Debussy, Brahms, you name it.
Then Mrs. Mazzanovich got a fund together, "Eunice Waymon Fund,"
and I gave lots of recitals, and they would take up collection to further my education after I had left her.
[Lisa] Mommy took to all of the training like a fish to water, but it was a double-edged sword.
She had a very lonely life because she was practicing seven, eight hours a day.
[Nina] When I first started to take lessons,
I became terribly aware of how isolated I was from the other children, and how isolated I was from the white community and the negro community.
I felt it, all the time, even when the kids used to play with me.
They always wanted me just to play the piano for them to dance.
I wasn't asked too much to do anything else.
That was very hard.
Part of that isolation, of course, was the thing about color.
I was a black girl, and I knew about it, and I lived in it.
I lived in the South for 17 years.
[Lisa] My mom rarely referred to Jim Crow and segregation and a lot of the racial issues that were going on at that stage in her life.
But she did tell me about times when she was told her nose was too big, her lips were too full and her skin was too dark.
And after she was told that, they probably told her,
"There's only certain things you'll be good for in your life."
[Nina] What I knew, I knew.
But we weren't allowed to mention anything racial in our house.
I wasn't consciously dealing with race.
That wasn't consciously on my mind at all... until years later.
After I graduated from high school, the money that had been saved from the Eunice Waymon Fund sent me to New York to Juilliard for a year and a half.
And then I applied for a scholarship to Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
I was playing Czerny and Liszt and Rachmaninoff and Bach.
I knew I was good enough, but they turned me down, and it took me about six months to realize it was because I was black.
I never really got over that jolt of racism at the time.
Then the money ran out and the reality hit me that I had to go to work.
My parents had moved the whole family to Philadelphia to be near me, and my family is very poor, so I had to work.
What else was there for me to do?
So, I got myself a job in Atlantic City for a summer.
It was a very crummy bar and I used to go in in evening gowns.
I didn't know any better.
And I played everything that I could think of.
Pop songs, classical, spirituals, all kinds of things.
It was very strange.
And I had never sung before, and the owner came in the second night and told me if I wanted to keep the job, I had to sing.
So, $90 was more money than I had ever heard of in my life, so I said, "Well, I'll sing," and ever since then, I've been singing.
[Roger Nupie] Eunice Waymon was playing in the bars to support her family and to have money to continue her classical piano training.
But since she didn't want her mother to know that she was playing "the devil's music" in bars, she changed her name.
Eunice Waymon became Nina Simone.
She named herself "Niña," meaning "little one,"
and she had a boyfriend who called her "Niña,"
and "Simone" came from the French actress Simone Signoret.
[Nina] I didn't want my mother to find out.
I knew she would hate it.
So I, kind of, kept it from her for a long, long time.
[interviewer] Was it lonely for a young girl entertaining in these strange bars?
[Nina] Extremely.
Extremely lonely.
[interviewer] Working peculiar hours, I imagine.
[Nina] 12:00 midnight to 7:00 in the morning.
[interviewer] It ruined your social life, uh...
[Nina] Never had much of one.
[interviewer] Why'd you keep on with it?
[Nina] Couldn't help it.
I have to play and I needed money.
It was always a matter of necessity from day to day what I'm going to do.
I didn't even know I was going to stay in show business.
I never thought about a choice.

[Al] The first time I played with Nina, it was the summer of 1957 at a restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania.
She didn't look at me.
Said nothing, as though I wasn't...
I wasn't even there, and started in on a song.
She never told me what key she was going to be in.
She just started playing, and I knew exactly where I was going to go with it.
It was like we had a telepathic relationship.
Before you knew it, we were just weaving in and out.
And then she looked up.

[Nina] Al Schackman is a terribly sensitive, creative man.
He has perfect pitch, which means that no matter what key I'm in, he's able to adapt himself immediately, 'cause I do that all the time.

but, like, metamorphosizing it.

[Nina] What I was interested in was conveying an emotional message, which means using everything you've got inside you sometimes to barely make a note or if you have to strain to sing, you sing.

[George Wein] When I first saw Nina at my club in 1959,
I was impressed.
She was different.
She mixed in folk music with jazz.
She played very fine piano.
Her voice was totally different from anybody else.
It was a woman's voice, but it had the depth of a baritone.
That depth and that darkness carried the insight of what was in Nina's soul... and it reached you very quickly.

[Nina] Then I recorded seven or eight tunes that I had been doing all of those years, and of course, the public picked out "I Loves You Porgy."
It was not pushed or promoted to be a hit at all.
-Girls!
Guys!
Hi.
-Hi, Hugh, nice to see you.

He walked into your life and became a permanent part.
How did you meet your husband?
[Nina] He came to see me at a nightclub and a mutual friend introduced us.
Nina came to the table and sat, and I was eating a hamburger plate, and there were fries, and she dipped into them.
And she wanted to know if it was okay.
I said, "All right."
We got cute and then she gave me that card with a note on it.
Then I went over to see her at her place in the next day or two.

And he had come for me.
I fell in love with him.
Then later, he scared me to death.
He was so, you know...
He knew what he wanted and he just took over.

He abandoned his own career as a sergeant of the police department to manage me, and for the first time, I knew what it was not to be just floundering out there.

[song ends] [all clapping]
[Al] I just remember meeting Andy.
Here was a tough, New York, you know, vice squad cop, that when he stepped out of his car uptown, people ran.
And he had... he had a way of just saying one word... [in deep voice] "Hey."
...and that could put a lot of fear in people.
But Andy and Nina married in 1961.
He retired from the police force and became her manager, and he did well for her.
They bought a beautiful house in Mount Vernon, New York.
[Nina] We had a 13-room house, four acres of land, lot of trees.

[Nina] And Lisa was born nine months later.
The first three hours after Lisa was born were the most peaceful in my life, and I was in love with the world.
And Andrew was there.
He was sitting right there, and he said--
I said, "How's the baby?" He says, "How's the mother?"
And I loved him for that.
I loved being a mother.
I was a good mother.
I was a goddamn good mother.
[Lisa] I remember our house in Mount Vernon like the back of my hand.
It was like a fairy tale.
I remember seeing the paisley on the walls.
The walls were kind of like a...
[sighs]
They were hued in gold, but it really wasn't gold.
It was more like a muted gold but it felt like it was velvet.
So I'd always run my hands, like, over the walls, because it was textured.
And my mom, she had her cold storage where she kept her fur coats and her costumes.
So I was always in there.
[Andy] These were the good, sweet days.
We were building and growing together.
[song continues]
[Andy] I had an overall plan to develop and create her as an artist.
I had set up an office at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street.
I had a publicist.
I had a guy who was a record-promotion man that I got from Atlantic Records.
I had another fellow who did the college radio station promotion, and a photographer.
Dad was the original Puff Daddy.
I mean, he really had a vision, and he was a very astute businessman.
[Andy] And of course, she was burning to get on to Carnegie Hall.
She had trained as a classical pianist with the one thought in mind of being the first black female classical pianist to appear in Carnegie Hall.
That was her prime objective.
However, none of the New York City promoters would undertake this project.
So, I took my own money to promote the appearance.
She was ecstatic.
I mean, she was out of her mind with joy.
[interviewer] You apparently wrote a letter to your parents saying,
"This is where you wanted me to play,
-but I should have been playing Bach." -[Nina] "Playing Bach."
[interviewer] So this was your glory occasion, but you were still disappointed?
[Nina] Well, I loved the audience, but I wasn't playing classical music, and I wanted to be, and so I wrote,
"Yes, I'm in Carnegie Hall, finally, but I'm not playing Bach."

[host 1] Miss Simone brings to her music a kind of technique and discipline we generally associate with classical music.
She has introduced fugue and counterpoint into the freewheeling spontaneity of the jazz world.
[interviewer] Nina, do you think that now that you are successful as a popular artist that you'd like to do any classical?
[Nina] Yes, but I don't have time to think about it too much.
But you have to realize that when I'm most satisfied with my music,
I call upon all of the things that I have learned in classical music.
[Andy] She wanted everything that money and success could buy.
So I promised her that she was going to be a rich black bitch.
[Nina] We had a blackboard and he used to put on there,
"I'll be a rich black bitch by this such-and-such date,"
and he said, "Then you could quit," and I always believed him, but I never could quit because he worked me too hard.

[Lisa] I didn't realize what my mom did for a living.
I just know that Mom was always traveling.
My mother often told me that I had 13 nannies in seven years.
So, while she was trying to maintain some sense of a schedule for me and normalcy for me, she was out there doing what she was doing.
[Nina] Can I have five more minutes?
It's very frustrating...
[Al] When we were on the road, there were times we had to be careful.
She could get angry and start arguments with people.
Y'all pushing!
You're pushing!
Don't put nothin' in it!
Let's do it again.
[Al] If anyone were talking in the audience, she would just sit, and at first, she would say, "Please..."
and she said, "I'm not continuing."
She'd get up, walk out, and the gig was over.
[Nina] I just want them to listen to the music like they did in the classical world.
I thought they needed teaching.
If they couldn't listen, fuck it!
[Andy] She got into Carnegie Hall, and she got the big house in the country, but she began questioning herself.

So, she came to resent Andy... but she was afraid of Andy.
[Nina] Andrew protected me against everybody but himself.
He wrapped himself around me like a snake.
I worked like a dog, and I was scared of him... and Andrew beat me up.
But I've never talked to you about this.

Bloody blows.
He beat me all the way home, up the stairs, in the elevator, in my room, put a gun to my head.
Then he tied me up and raped me.
She came to my place and...
and she was beat up.
And I, you know, put her to bed, and... and she, you know, rested for a couple of days.
[Nina] He didn't find me for two weeks.

He said, "No, I didn't.

[Lisa] My mother always said, till the day she died,
Dad was the best manager that she ever had.
But on top of being charismatic, he could be a bully and he could be very mean, and she was on the receiving end of that... more times than, you know, she should have been,
which should have been never.
Mom would allude to, you know,
"He's rammed my head into a concrete wall."
She said that he punched her in the stomach when she was pregnant with me.
[Lisa] As a child, I remember sitting in the car between them and they were arguing about something, and I remember my father reaching across me, so it was like this, and backhanding her.
[Andy] We're going home in the car, I'm driving, and I slapped her.
Blood spurted...
right over this eyebrow.
She had, like, a one-inch cut from my ring, you know.
We got her home and I clipped the skin together and taped it... and a week later, there wasn't even a scar.
[Lisa] I think they were both nuts.
She stayed with him.
She had this love affair with fire.
That's like inviting the bull with the red cape,
"Just come on into my kitchen and let's see what we can do."
That's what she did.
-What do I want for her?
-[interviewer] Yes.
Myself.
What else?
-[laughing] -[interviewer] Career-wise.
[Lisa] My father had a strategic plan in terms of how Mom's career was going to go.
He wanted her to be able to win all the awards, and to become the huge star that he knew that she could be... but she wanted something more.
There was something missing in her, some meaning.

There's something about a woman... if you look at all the suffering that black folks went through... not one black man would dare say, "Mississippi, goddam."

In '65, we played at the Selma March in Montgomery, Alabama.

[Al] It was extremely dangerous.
The federal Marshals were called in, and they were standing on the tops of all the buildings downtown with guns.

[Lisa] My mother said that after she sang that song, she got so angry that her voice broke... and from "Mississippi Goddam" on, it never, ever returned to its former octave.
[crowd singing "Go Tell It On The Mountain"]
But I think that Mom's anger is what sustained her.
The energy and the creativity and the passion of those days is really what kept her going.
[Andy] When she wrote "Mississippi Goddam,"
I thought it was something else.
You know, I liked it.
They put a 45 out on it, and I knew it had a lot of impact.
But my complaint was that while I was always pushing for the commercial side of the picture, she got sidetracked with all of these civil rights activities.
[Nina] When the civil rights thing came up, all of a sudden,
I could let myself be heard about what I'd been feeling all the time.
When I was young, I knew to stay alive.
As a black family, we had to work at it.
We had to keep secrets.
We never complained about being poor, or being taken advantage of or not getting our share.
We had to keep our mouths shut as I walked across that railroad track every Saturday.
So I knew to break the silence meant a confrontation with the white people of that town.

[Nina] It touched me first time when I gave a recital at this library.
Everybody was seated and they told me my parents had to sit in the back, and I said,
"If they have to sit in the back, I won't perform."
They fixed it that time and they brought them to the front and they let them sit down, but it was my first feeling of being discriminated against, and I recoiled in horror at such a thing.

But it was very exhilarating to be part of that movement at the time because I was needed.
Now I could sing to help my people, and that became the mainstay of my life.
Not classical piano, not classical music, not even popular music, but civil rights music.
I got to know Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Andrew Young, and artists, actors, actresses, poets, writers, people like myself who felt compelled to make the stand that I have.
[Roger] It was very important for her to connect with the writers and playwrights of that moment because those people had the intellectual background of the movement and she didn't have that.
She had music, the musical background.
For instance, Langston Hughes, he wrote the lyrics for "Backlash Blues" for her.
Lorraine Hansberry, Nina took her play, Young, Gifted, and Black, and made a song out of it.
It's regarded as one of the most important songs in the civil rights movement.

I look back now and I'm just like, "Wow!

Malcolm X's wife, Betty Shabazz, was my auntie.
They lived right next door in Mount Vernon.
There are six daughters and I was like the seventh.
So I was always riding my bike over there.
Lisa and I were the same age, and...
I think we may have called one another twins.
It was just a great, great time.
There was music, there were discussions.
Whether it was at our house or Lisa's house, Nina Simone's home, it was definitely party with a purpose.
[Ambassador Shabazz] We happened to be a fly on the wall with some of the genius poets and poetesses of the time, the era.
And to sit in that room and listen...
These were brilliant, well-read, well-traveled, charming, alluring, charismatic people who were moved to make a difference in the world.

She'd fly off.
I remember a few nights, you know, you go to bed happy and holding one another.
I wake up, and she'd be sitting up in bed with her arms folded, looking at me, thinking about killing me.
And this is how it went.
The political work became very heavy.
[Nina] To me, we are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world, black people.
So my job is to make them more curious about where they came from and their own identity and pride in that identity.
That's why my songs...
I try to make them as powerful as possible, mostly just to make them curious about themselves.
We don't know anything about ourselves.
We don't even have the pride and the dignity of African people, but we can't even talk about where we came from.
We don't know.

And he said, "That's okay, sister.

[Nina] I was never non-violent.
Never.
I thought we should get our rights by any means necessary.
[Al] And then she met Stokely Carmichael.
Miss Simone says something very significant in her song "Mississippi Goddam."
She says, "This country..." She says, "This country is built on lies."
You're gonna sit in front of your television set and listen to LBJ tell you that,

It was cutting the legs out from all the work that I had done.

[Lisa] I remember my dad complaining about the fact that she never stopped speaking out, but that's who she was.

It's okay 'cause you let it all hang out, and then when the show ends and the lights go out,
"Okay, let's put the monkey back in the cage, and eat your banana and, you know, just behave yourself."
It was like she was penalized and punished for being herself.

Is this really the artist's role?

We did a tour with Bill Cosby, and the last night, she became erratic.
She had a can of shoe polish.
She was putting it in her hair.
And she began talking gibberish, and she was totally out of it, incoherent.
It appeared she was having a nervous breakdown.
And when it came time to go on,
I had to escort her by holding her arm onto the stage and sat her down at the piano, and I immediately stood in the wings on the opposite side where we could see one another.
She's watching me pantomime and she performed.
Basically, she had no control over her emotions, and underneath it all, sex dominated her.
There were times, once or twice a week, when there was a sex attack when she goes into a maniacal rage.
There had to be sex.
I mean, this is driving her.
[Nina] My attitude towards sex was that we should have it all the time.
[interviewer] How did Andy act towards you?
[Nina] I just wanted him to move me sexually, and he never was able to.
[interviewer] Right.
[Nina] He didn't know how to touch me and he never had enough time.
He'd come to see me late at night and be there two hours and leave.
[Andy] I knew that she was dating other people.
We agreed that we could both have our own outside partners... but we would work together for the sake of the business and the child.
[Shabazz] I can't sit here and speak about Aunt Nina and Uncle Andy's marriage.
What I can say is that participation and activism during the '60s... rendered chaos in any individual's lives.
People sacrificed sanity, well-being, life.
Nina Simone was a free spirit in an era that didn't really appreciate a woman's genius.
So what does that do to a household and a family?

I wore...
Bikinis and boots is all I wore.
[woman] Yeah.
[Nina] Well, there was no loneliness.
There was no boredom.
The days flew into nights, and you just couldn't keep up with the times 'cause there was so much to do.
It was always fun.
I also am keenly aware that I've entered a world that I dreamed of all my life and that it is a perfect world.
And I remember thinking of the United States as something that I had had in a dream sometime in my life, but is now gone, like it never existed!
It was a dream that I had had and I had worked myself out of it 'cause I had toiled so long in that place, in that prison... and now I'm home, now I'm free,
and there is no going back.
There, it was vast and open, and everything was natural.
Everything!
I have seen lightning in Africa not flash, but hover, and what it does is it electrifies you into complete speechlessness.
I have seen it!
I have seen God.
[Lisa] In my seventh grade year, Mom moved me to Liberia, but she was always traveling, and I never knew half the time if I wasn't going, that she was leaving or when she was coming back.
So I lived with a family for a year and I went to school there, and I lived with them until Mom came and decided to buy a house on the beach, and I went from living with them to living with her,
and she just...
I could never do anything right.
She went from being my comfort to the monster in my life.
Now she was the person that was doing the beating, and she was beating me.
One time, we were in public somewhere, I did something, and she just... she went off on me in front of everybody, and I didn't show any emotion because when Mom...
when Mom would see you cry, she knew she could push your buttons.
That's what she wanted, and I would not give her that satisfaction.
When she would hit me, I would look her dead in her face... and she'd be like, "You better cry.
You better cry."
I wouldn't do it.
Times got really bad, to the point where I thought about committing suicide.
So, when I was 14, I flew to New York, and I wound up living with my dad and I never went back.
[Andy] After we broke up, a lot of things happened.
She didn't file taxes.
She didn't take care of business.
She lost the house in Mount Vernon.
Everything went crazy.
[Roger] She lived a nomadic life, having no manager, having no husband... but she always said living in Africa was the happiest time in her life.
She could just be there, enjoy herself.
She didn't have to sing at all.
[Lisa] She wasn't playing piano and she wasn't performing.
She said she hated the piano.
She hated it.
Think about it.
She's playing since she was four years old.
[Roger] On the other hand, she was very well aware that in Africa, no money came in.
So she had to pick up her career again.
She didn't want to return to what she called,
"The United Snakes of America."
So she moved to Switzerland, which was the complete opposite of Africa, and the first thing she did was the Montreux concert.
[audience applauding]
You on yet?
Do you hear all those noises?
You didn't forget me, huh?
That's-
- That's what's so wild, you didn't forget me.
I didn't expect you to, but I'm tired.
You don't know what I mean.
And there are many people in show business who said,
"Oh, she-
- You know, she used to be a star.
She's gone all the way to the bottom,"
and all kinds of crap which means nothing to me at all.
I hope that you will see me or see the spirit in another sphere, on another plane very soon now.
And again, I don't wanna let you down and I get this feeling.
So I think the only way to tell you who I am these days... is to sing a song by Janis Ian.

[Nina] In Switzerland, there I had no money.
I never got anything from Andy.
He just cut himself off from me and I was left high and dry.
So I left Switzerland and I went to Paris, thinking that I could resume my career.
I did it alone and I landed in the wrong place.
I was working every night in a small cafe for about $300 a night.
[stammering] [speaking French]
No, we just do "Vous Etes Seuls."
It goes like this!
[singing "Vous Êtes Seul, Mais Je Désire Être Avec Vous"]
[Nina] I was desperate and no one believed that I was there.
I was too big to be there.
No one came to see me.
And I had fallen from grace.
I'm sorry that I didn't become the world's first black classic pianist.
I think I would have been happier.
I'm not very happy now.
I wouldn't change being part of the civil rights movement.
I wouldn't change that.
But some of the songs that I sang have hurt my career.
All of the controversial songs the industry decided to punish me for... and they put a boycott on all of my records, and it's, uh... hard for me to incorporate those songs anymore because they are not relevant to the times.
In terms of the civil rights movement, how far have we come?
There aren't any civil rights!
What do you mean?
There is no reason to sing those songs.
Nothing is happening.
There's no civil rights movement.
Everybody's gone.
[Gerrit de Bruin] I met Nina in 1967 and I've been her friend all her life.
She called me in 1982 and she was here in Paris, living in a very small apartment, hardly with any money.
She did concerts of four hours long at Trois Mailletz, that nightclub, and she got a few hundred dollars a night.
And that was the worst period.
I visited her in that little apartment and it was so dirty, so I cleaned it all up and, "Nina, you can't live like this,"
but at that moment, she was still uncontrollable.
This thing in the Grand Hotel in Paris happened.
Somebody looked her in the eyes a bit too long, and she was already a bit nervous and she kind of... made a movement and I thought, "She's going to hit him."
Immediately, my arms around her, and I dragged her out in a taxi and I said to the taxi driver, "Drive!"
[Al] When I saw her in Paris, she was like a street urchin dressed in rags.
I couldn't believe what was happening and I was really, really sad.
Gerrit and I, we knew something was very wrong, and we were trying to figure out, and like, "What is it?
What is it, really?"
So Gerrit found her a condo in Nijmegen in Holland, and Gerrit had a friend, a doctor, that he brought to Nina's place, and the doctor examined her and asked her questions, and he prescribed a medication
which was kind of new... new spectrum, called Trilafon.
[Lisa] It wasn't till I was in my 20s and I went to visit her in Nijmegen, that's when I learned the term "manic-depressive" and "bipolar"
and I remember asking,
"Well, what is that?
What do you mean by that?"
And her mood swings and a lot of the things I dealt with earlier in life when, you know, one minute she'd be happy and then the next minute...
I'd be dealing with someone that wasn't in the room five minutes ago.
It started to make sense.
[Gerrit] She got so deep in the shit in the end that she realized it's either dying or give in.
And she gave in because we said, "Nina... we'll get you a house, we'll get you your musicians, we'll make the things all right around you, we'll book your concerts... but you have to do as we say.
You have to take your medicine.
You have to work.
God has given you the possibility to be able to do what you do, so do it!
The only thing we want to hear is either 'yes' or 'no.'"
And she said, with tears in her eyes, "Yes."
[Lisa] When I saw her,
I was very concerned because she had a... a nervous tic.
You know, she'd be talking or sitting and this--
Her mouth would always be twitching, and when she would walk, it was more of a shuffle.
And I'm like, "What's going on here?"
You know, "Why--
What's going on?
What am I missing?"
And they had her on medication.
[Al] She started taking the Trilafon and the doctor said,
"Through the years, it's going to have an effect on her motor skills.
Her voice is going to start to slur and her piano abilities will decline.
You can deal with that or you can deal with her probably damaging herself or someone else."
But the Trilafon really helped.
I mean, there were times in Holland, sitting on her terrace in these lounge chairs and just holding hands...
I mean, she was like-- She was my sister.
...and not talking at all for hours, just enjoying the day.
[Lisa] And I suppose that medication enabled her to perform and fulfill the business dealings that were taking place so that her career could get back on track, but there were times when I questioned that, you know, "But what about her heart?"
Because at the end of the day, you guys got wives and husbands and lives, but she's alone.
[Nina] My personal life is a shambles.
I've had a few love affairs and I would love to be married, but everything has had to be sacrificed for the music.
[crowd cheering and applauding]
[Gerrit] We had to do, first in Holland, eight concerts, and the word spread that Nina's doing the job well.
Then she was on the road again and it was... poof.
The business was going.
[Roger] She came onstage and you had this overwhelming, emotional feeling coming from the audience just because she was there.
Now listen to me.
I love you very much.
I think you know that and I know that you love me.
-I know that.
-[audience member whoops] [cheers and applause]
[Roger] And we never knew too well what was going to happen and how the mood would be.
So this place is very hot and it's very crowded and it's very ugly.
[audience laughing]
[Roger] But she opened her heart and soul at that moment.
That's this special kind of connection she had with an audience.
This song is popular all over France.
It's from our first album... the very first album we made in this world, which is at least 25 years old.
I only wish I was as wise... could have been as wise then as I have become now.
I have suffered.
But there's a Bösendorfer here, so we'll see what happens.
"My Baby Just Cares For Me."
She was helped by "My Baby Just Cares For Me,"
that song that became a hit because of the Chanel advertisement.
[Nina] And when "My Baby Just Cares For Me" came along, I said,
"I have to take this opportunity now to go all over the world because this is my last chance."
And so I worked very hard to take advantage of my second coming because it was my last time as far as I was concerned.

[Shabazz] As I got older, I started to look at her and I thought to myself,

The times was at odds with her.
I think when a person moves to their own kind of clock, spirit, flow, if we were living in an environment that allowed us to be exactly who we are, you're always in congress with yourself.
The challenge is,
"How do we fit in in the world that we're around, but we--
Are we allowed to be exactly who we are?
Was Nina Simone allowed to be exactly who she was?"
As fragile as she was strong, as vulnerable as she was dynamic, she was African royalty.
How does royalty stomp around in the mud and still walk with grace?

Tremendous pleasure and honor to welcome the incredible, unique, and fantastic, one and only Nina Simone.
Hello.
Hi!
We're ready.
One, two, three.
I haven't seen you for many years, since 1968.
I have decided that I will do no more jazz festivals.
That decision has not changed.
I will sing for you, or we will do and share with you a few moments,
after which I shall graduate to a higher class, I hope, and I hope you will come with me.
We will start from the beginning, which was about a little girl,
and her name was Blue.
What's "free" to you, Nina?
- What's "free" to me?
- Yeah.
Same thing it is to you.
You tell me.
No, no, you tell me.
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.
It's just a feeling.
It's like, "How do you tell somebody how it feels to be in love?"
How are you going to tell anybody who has not been in love how it feels to be in love?
You cannot do it to save your life.
You can describe things but you can't tell them, but you know it when it happens.
That's what I mean by "free."
I've had a couple of times onstage when I really felt free, and that's something else.
That's really something else!
Like, all... all...
Like...
like--
I'll tell you what freedom is to me, no fear.
I mean, really, no fear.
If I could have that half of my life, no fear.

My mother was one of the greatest entertainers of all time, hands down... but she paid a huge price.

Good evening.
Our guest tonight is Nina Simone.
Probably the foremost blues singer, jazz singer, singer of all songs in the United States today.
Nina, are you happy with the kind of work you are doing?
What makes me the happiest, is when I'm performing and there are people out there who feel with me and I know I touched them.
But to be completely honest, the whole thing seems so much like a dream.
I never thought I was gonna stay in show business.
When I first got into show business,
I wasn't a blues singer and I wasn't even a jazz singer.
I was a classical pianist.
I studied to become the first black classical pianist in America, and that's all that was on my mind.
That's what I was prepared to be.
I was born Eunice Waymon, which is my real name, by the way, in a town called Tryon, North Carolina.
I started to play the piano when I was three or four.
My mother was a preacher and she took me with her on her revivals, and I started to play the piano in church.
♪ Children go where I send you ♪
♪ How shall I send you?
♪
♪ I'm gonna send you one by one ♪
♪ One for the little biddy baby was born, born, born in Bethlehem ♪
Revival meetings were some of the most exciting times that I've ever had.
The music was so intense, you just sort of went out of yourself.
I felt it tremendously.
I was leading it.
When I was seven, the choir of our church gave a program at the local theater, and I was on that program...
And I played some song, I don't remember what it was, and these two women, two white women, in the audience heard me.
One of them was the woman that my mother worked for, and the other one was a music teacher, Mrs. Mazzanovich, and they decided right then and there to give me lessons.
And so, for five years after that,
I studied piano, classical piano, with this teacher.
I crossed the railroad tracks every weekend to get to Mrs. Mazzanovich.
And, you know, railroad tracks in the South are supposed to be dividing the blacks from the whites.
Well, it really did.
I was so scared.
Mrs. Mazzanovich frightened me.
It was her being white, in the sense that I had never seen.
She was alien to me.
Her white hair, the combs in it, her pleasantness...
I loved that.
And she started me on Bach.
And this Bach, I liked him.
Mrs. Mazzanovich had it in her mind that I was gonna be one of the world's greatest concert pianists.
So it was all very disciplined classical music.
Bach, Beethoven, Debussy, Brahms, you name it.
Then Mrs. Mazzanovich got a fund together, "Eunice Waymon Fund,"
and I gave lots of recitals, and they would take up collection to further my education after I had left her.
Mommy took to all of the training like a fish to water, but it was a double-edged sword.
She had a very lonely life because she was practicing seven, eight hours a day.
When I first started to take lessons,
I became terribly aware of how isolated I was from the other children, and how isolated I was from the white community and the negro community.
I felt it, all the time, even when the kids used to play with me.
They always wanted me just to play the piano for them to dance.
I wasn't asked too much to do anything else.
That was very hard.
Part of that isolation, of course, was the thing about color.
I was a black girl, and I knew about it, and I lived in it.
I lived in the South for 17 years.
My mom rarely referred to Jim Crow and segregation and a lot of the racial issues that were going on at that stage in her life.
But she did tell me about times when she was told her nose was too big, her lips were too full and her skin was too dark.
And after she was told that, they probably told her,
"There's only certain things you'll be good for in your life."
What I knew, I knew.
But we weren't allowed to mention anything racial in our house.
I wasn't consciously dealing with race.
That wasn't consciously on my mind at all... until years later.
After I graduated from high school, the money that had been saved from the Eunice Waymon Fund sent me to New York to Juilliard for a year and a half.
And then I applied for a scholarship to Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
I was playing Czerny and Liszt and Rachmaninoff and Bach.
I knew I was good enough, but they turned me down, and it took me about six months to realize it was because I was black.
I never really got over that jolt of racism at the time.
Then the money ran out and the reality hit me that I had to go to work.
My parents had moved the whole family to Philadelphia to be near me, and my family is very poor, so I had to work.
What else was there for me to do?
So, I got myself a job in Atlantic City for a summer.
It was a very crummy bar and I used to go in in evening gowns.
I didn't know any better.
And I played everything that I could think of.
Pop songs, classical, spirituals, all kinds of things.
It was very strange.
And I had never sung before, and the owner came in the second night and told me if I wanted to keep the job, I had to sing.
So, $90 was more money than I had ever heard of in my life, so I said, "Well, I'll sing," and ever since then, I've been singing.
Eunice Waymon was playing in the bars to support her family and to have money to continue her classical piano training.
But since she didn't want her mother to know that she was playing "the devil's music" in bars, she changed her name.
Eunice Waymon became Nina Simone.
She named herself "Niña," meaning "little one,"
and she had a boyfriend who called her "Niña,"
and "Simone" came from the French actress Simone Signoret.
I didn't want my mother to find out.
I knew she would hate it.
So I, kind of, kept it from her for a long, long time.
Was it lonely for a young girl entertaining in these strange bars?
Extremely.
Extremely lonely.
Working peculiar hours, I imagine.
12:00 midnight to 7:00 in the morning.
It ruined your social life, uh...
Never had much of one.
- Why'd you keep on with it?
- Couldn't help it.
I have to play and I needed money.
It was always a matter of necessity from day to day what I'm going to do.
I didn't even know I was going to stay in show business.
I never thought about a choice.

The first time I played with Nina, it was the summer of 1957 at a restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania.
She didn't look at me.
Said nothing, as though I wasn't...
I wasn't even there, and started in on a song.
She never told me what key she was going to be in.
She just started playing, and I knew exactly where I was going to go with it.
It was like we had a telepathic relationship.
Before you knew it, we were just weaving in and out.
And then she looked up.

When I first saw Nina at my club in 1959,
I was impressed.
She was different.
She mixed in folk music with jazz.
She played very fine piano.
Her voice was totally different from anybody else.
It was a woman's voice, but it had the depth of a baritone.

Then I recorded seven or eight tunes that I had been doing all of those years, and of course, the public picked out "I Loves You Porgy."
It was not pushed or promoted to be a hit at all.

He came to see me at a nightclub and a mutual friend introduced us.
Nina came to the table and sat, and I was eating a hamburger plate, and there were fries, and she dipped into them.
And she wanted to know if it was okay.
I said, "All right."
We got cute and then she gave me that card with a note on it.

How did you know that Andy Stroud was to be your husband and not just another guy out for a date or something else?
That's a hard question.
He told me that he had wanted to meet me for a long time.
And he had come for me.
I fell in love with him.
Then later, he scared me to death.
He was so, you know...
He knew what he wanted and he just took over.

He abandoned his own career as a sergeant of the police department to manage me, and for the first time, I knew what it was not to be just floundering out there.

I just remember meeting Andy.
Here was a tough, New York, you know, vice squad cop, that when he stepped out of his car uptown, people ran.
And he had... he had a way of just saying one word...
"Hey."
...and that could put a lot of fear in people.
But Andy and Nina married in 1961.
He retired from the police force and became her manager, and he did well for her.
They bought a beautiful house in Mount Vernon, New York.
We had a 13-room house, four acres of land, lot of trees.

And Lisa was born nine months later.
The first three hours after Lisa was born were the most peaceful in my life, and I was in love with the world.
And Andrew was there.
He was sitting right there, and he said--
I said, "How's the baby?" He says, "How's the mother?"
And I loved him for that.
I loved being a mother.
I was a good mother.
I was a goddamn good mother.
I remember our house in Mount Vernon like the back of my hand.
It was like a fairy tale.
I remember seeing the paisley on the walls.
The walls were kind of like a...
They were hued in gold, but it really wasn't gold.
It was more like a muted gold but it felt like it was velvet.
So I'd always run my hands, like, over the walls, because it was textured.
And my mom, she had her cold storage where she kept her fur coats and her costumes.
So I was always in there.
These were the good, sweet days.
We were building and growing together.
I had an overall plan to develop and create her as an artist.
I had set up an office at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street.
I had a publicist.
I had a guy who was a record-promotion man that I got from Atlantic Records.
I had another fellow who did the college radio station promotion, and a photographer.
Dad was the original Puff Daddy.
I mean, he really had a vision, and he was a very astute businessman.
And of course, she was burning to get on to Carnegie Hall.
She had trained as a classical pianist with the one thought in mind of being the first black female classical pianist to appear in Carnegie Hall.
That was her prime objective.
However, none of the New York City promoters would undertake this project.
So, I took my own money to promote the appearance.
She was ecstatic.
I mean, she was out of her mind with joy.
You apparently wrote a letter to your parents saying,
"This is where you wanted me to play,
- but I should have been playing Bach." - "Playing Bach."
So this was your glory occasion, but you were still disappointed?
Well, I loved the audience, but I wasn't playing classical music, and I wanted to be, and so I wrote,
"Yes, I'm in Carnegie Hall, finally, but I'm not playing Bach."

She became highly successful and recognized.
- Oh!
Thank you very much!
- Meeting in Japan.
A young woman who's made a very emphatic name for herself...
An accomplished pianist and distinctive who's now become a rather famous artist.
A remarkable blues-soul sound.
For the first time on British television,
The High Priestess of Soul...
- Nina Simone.
- Nina Simone.
The great Nina Simone.
Miss Simone brings to her music a kind of technique and discipline we generally associate with classical music.
She has introduced fugue and counterpoint into the freewheeling spontaneity of the jazz world.
Nina, do you think that now that you are successful as a popular artist that you'd like to do any classical?
Yes, but I don't have time to think about it too much.
But you have to realize that when I'm most satisfied with my music,
I call upon all of the things that I have learned in classical music.
She wanted everything that money and success could buy.
So I promised her that she was going to be a rich black bitch.
We had a blackboard and he used to put on there,
"I'll be a rich black bitch by this such-and-such date,"
and he said, "Then you could quit," and I always believed him, but I never could quit because he worked me too hard.

I didn't realize what my mom did for a living.
I just know that Mom was always traveling.
My mother often told me that I had 13 nannies in seven years.
So, while she was trying to maintain some sense of a schedule for me and normalcy for me, she was out there doing what she was doing.
Can I have five more minutes?
It's very frustrating...
When we were on the road, there were times we had to be careful.
She could get angry and start arguments with people.
Y'all pushing!
You're pushing!
Don't put nothin' in it!
Let's do it again.
If anyone were talking in the audience, she would just sit, and at first, she would say, "Please..."
and she said, "I'm not continuing."
She'd get up, walk out, and the gig was over.
I just want them to listen to the music like they did in the classical world.
I thought they needed teaching.
If they couldn't listen, fuck it!
She got into Carnegie Hall, and she got the big house in the country, but she began questioning herself.
She'd get into moods of depression about the whole business, the personal relationship, cursing and smashing things, and this worsened as the time went by.

She felt she was being handled like a racehorse, and she was always fighting, fighting, fighting it.
Andy would say, "Nina, we've got a career here.
That's not going to continue if you don't nurture it."
So, she came to resent Andy... but she was afraid of Andy.
Andrew protected me against everybody but himself.
He wrapped himself around me like a snake.
I worked like a dog, and I was scared of him... and Andrew beat me up.
But I've never talked to you about this.
But he beat me up.
I was deathly scared of Andrew.

I mean, she related this to me.
And Andy came back and grabbed her arm and took her out from the place and beat her up.
And when I got out on the street, he started raining blows on me.
Bloody blows.
He beat me all the way home, up the stairs, in the elevator, in my room, put a gun to my head.
Then he tied me up and raped me.
She came to my place and...
and she was beat up.
And I, you know, put her to bed, and... and she, you know, rested for a couple of days.
He didn't find me for two weeks.
My eyes, I couldn't see.
And he said, "Who beat you up like that?"
And I said, "You did!"
He said, "No, I didn't.
I've been looking for you for two weeks."
I said, "You're insane!"
He was brutal...

My mother always said, till the day she died,
Dad was the best manager that she ever had.
But on top of being charismatic, he could be a bully and he could be very mean, and she was on the receiving end of that... more times than, you know, she should have been,
which should have been never.
Mom would allude to, you know,
"He's rammed my head into a concrete wall."
She said that he punched her in the stomach when she was pregnant with me.
As a child, I remember sitting in the car between them and they were arguing about something, and I remember my father reaching across me, so it was like this, and backhanding her.
We're going home in the car, I'm driving, and I slapped her.
Blood spurted...
right over this eyebrow.
She had, like, a one-inch cut from my ring, you know.
We got her home and I clipped the skin together and taped it... and a week later, there wasn't even a scar.
I think they were both nuts.
She stayed with him.
She had this love affair with fire.
That's like inviting the bull with the red cape,
"Just come on into my kitchen and let's see what we can do."
That's what she did.
- What do I want for her?
- Yes.
Myself.
What else?
Career-wise.
My father had a strategic plan in terms of how Mom's career was going to go.
He wanted her to be able to win all the awards, and to become the huge star that he knew that she could be... but she wanted something more.
There was something missing in her, some meaning.
They died in Birmingham, the nation's most segregated big city.
Dynamite exploded on Sunday morning, killed four little girls, injured 20 other negroes.
It was one of more than 40 bombings in that Birmingham area.
Kids were murdered in Birmingham on a Sunday and in Sunday schools in a Christian nation, and nobody cares!
When the kids got killed in that church... that did it.
First you get depressed, and after that, you get mad.
And when these kids got bombed,
I just sat down and wrote this song.
And it's a very...
moving, violent song, 'cause that's how I feel about the whole thing.

Got my attention.
What she was doing was different.
There's something about a woman... if you look at all the suffering that black folks went through... not one black man would dare say, "Mississippi, goddam."
And then to have someone with her stature talking about your problem, you know how happy they had to be?
We all wanted to say it.
She said it.

As the civil rights movement really swung into high gear, she swung into high gear with it.
In '65, we played at the Selma March in Montgomery, Alabama.
We have a legal and constitutional right to march from Selma to Montgomery!
It was extremely dangerous.
The federal Marshals were called in, and they were standing on the tops of all the buildings downtown with guns.
Seated in front of the stage facing the audience was Martin Luther King,
Ralph Bunche from the UN and a lot of other worldwide dignitaries.
You had Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Sidney Poitier,
Bill Cosby, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Belafonte, and we did "Mississippi Goddam."

My mother said that after she sang that song, she got so angry that her voice broke... and from "Mississippi Goddam" on, it never, ever returned to its former octave.
But I think that Mom's anger is what sustained her.
The energy and the creativity and the passion of those days is really what kept her going.
When she wrote "Mississippi Goddam,"
I thought it was something else.
You know, I liked it.
They put a 45 out on it, and I knew it had a lot of impact.
But my complaint was that while I was always pushing for the commercial side of the picture, she got sidetracked with all of these civil rights activities.
When the civil rights thing came up, all of a sudden,
I could let myself be heard about what I'd been feeling all the time.
When I was young, I knew to stay alive.
As a black family, we had to work at it.
We had to keep secrets.
We never complained about being poor, or being taken advantage of or not getting our share.
We had to keep our mouths shut as I walked across that railroad track every Saturday.
So I knew to break the silence meant a confrontation with the white people of that town.

It touched me first time when I gave a recital at this library.
Everybody was seated and they told me my parents had to sit in the back, and I said,

But it was very exhilarating to be part of that movement at the time because I was needed.
Now I could sing to help my people, and that became the mainstay of my life.
Not classical piano, not classical music, not even popular music, but civil rights music.
I got to know Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Andrew Young, and artists, actors, actresses, poets, writers, people like myself who felt compelled to make the stand that I have.
It was very important for her to connect with the writers and playwrights of that moment because those people had the intellectual background of the movement and she didn't have that.
She had music, the musical background.
For instance, Langston Hughes, he wrote the lyrics for "Backlash Blues" for her.
Lorraine Hansberry, Nina took her play, Young, Gifted, and Black, and made a song out of it.
It's regarded as one of the most important songs in the civil rights movement.

Lorraine Hansberry was my godmother.
Malcolm X's wife, Betty Shabazz, was my auntie.
They lived right next door in Mount Vernon.
There are six daughters and I was like the seventh.
So I was always riding my bike over there.
Lisa and I were the same age, and...
I think we may have called one another twins.
It was just a great, great time.
There was music, there were discussions.
Whether it was at our house or Lisa's house, Nina Simone's home, it was definitely party with a purpose.
We happened to be a fly on the wall with some of the genius poets and poetesses of the time, the era.
And to sit in that room and listen...
These were brilliant, well-read, well-traveled, charming, alluring, charismatic people who were moved to make a difference in the world.
I'm born of the Young, Gifted, and Black affirmation.
For me, and those of us in that environment, it was daring to proclaim it... and then share it joyously when she sang it.

push the revolution.
I told them that's not the answer, and then it began to manifest in her attitude towards me and the business.
She'd fly off.
I remember a few nights, you know, you go to bed happy and holding one another.
I wake up, and she'd be sitting up in bed with her arms folded, looking at me, thinking about killing me.
And this is how it went.
The political work became very heavy.
To me, we are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world, black people.
So my job is to make them more curious about where they came from and their own identity and pride in that identity.
That's why my songs...
I try to make them as powerful as possible, mostly just to make them curious about themselves.
We don't know anything about ourselves.
We don't even have the pride and the dignity of African people, but we can't even talk about where we came from.
We don't know.

It was like she was penalized and punished for being herself.

Nina, when it comes to the artists today, we find that more of the artists are attempting to alert America to the need for change.
Is this really the artist's role?
Well, I think it's something that, um, I have chosen to do and I have felt compelled to do it.

We even went to Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital,
I think, signed her in for four or five days.
They conducted every test known to... medicine at the time and they were unable to find anything.

And her downward spiral, it just got worse and worse.
We did a tour with Bill Cosby, and the last night, she became erratic.
She had a can of shoe polish.
She was putting it in her hair.
And she began talking gibberish, and she was totally out of it, incoherent.
It appeared she was having a nervous breakdown.
And when it came time to go on,
I had to escort her by holding her arm onto the stage and sat her down at the piano, and I immediately stood in the wings on the opposite side where we could see one another.
She's watching me pantomime and she performed.
Basically, she had no control over her emotions, and underneath it all, sex dominated her.
There were times, once or twice a week, when there was a sex attack when she goes into a maniacal rage.
There had to be sex.
I mean, this is driving her.
My attitude towards sex was that we should have it all the time.
How did Andy act towards you?
I just wanted him to move me sexually, and he never was able to.
Right.
He didn't know how to touch me and he never had enough time.
He'd come to see me late at night and be there two hours and leave.
I knew that she was dating other people.
We agreed that we could both have our own outside partners... but we would work together for the sake of the business and the child.
I can't sit here and speak about Aunt Nina and Uncle Andy's marriage.
What I can say is that participation and activism during the '60s... rendered chaos in any individual's lives.
People sacrificed sanity, well-being, life.
Nina Simone was a free spirit in an era that didn't really appreciate a woman's genius.
So what does that do to a household and a family?
Not because of income, but because of your soul not being able to do what you need to do.
Direct from our newsroom in Washington, this is the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite.
Good evening.
Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
Jesus!
Jesus.
There was shock in the nation's negro communities.
Men, women and children poured into the streets.
They appeared dazed.
Many were crying.
I think White America made its biggest mistake when she killed Dr. King last night.
He was the one man in our race who was trying to teach our people to have love, compassion, and mercy for what white people had done.
When White America killed Dr. King last night, she killed all reasonable hope.
We want to do a tune written... for today... for this hour for Dr. Martin Luther King.
We had yesterday to learn it, and... so we'll see.

Last year, Lorraine Hansberry left us, and she was a dear friend, and then Langston Hughes left us.
Who can go on?
Do you realize how many we have lost?
Then it really gets down to reality, doesn't it?
Not a performance.
Not microphones and all that crap, but really something else.
We can't afford any more losses.
Oh, no.

I knew that we were lost.
I felt chased all the time, no matter what I did or how sad I got.
I felt that there was just no life for me in the country.
I knew I had to quit or I had to leave Andy or do something.
So I took my ring off, put it on the table... and I left the country.

According to my godsister Attallah Shabazz...
I was staying with them, and Mom had gone away, and the phone would ring and whenever it would ring,
I would go running, saying, "Is that my mommy on the phone?"
And then I remember going back to the house in Mount Vernon and Dad just wasn't there.
He wasn't there.
And nobody told me anything, you know?
And, um, so...
One day you're at home and the staff is there and your dad's there and the dog's there and everything that's familiar to you is there, and then you come back, I don't know, weeks later
and... nothing's there, nobody's there.
♪ Don't look for me ♪
I decided that I wanted to go to Africa to live and never come back to America.
I got a divorce from Andy and I went to Liberia... and I moved there to stay.
When I got to Africa, I am happy, I'm beyond happy.
Liberia is a place that was founded by the American slaves, and it only makes sense that I should feel at home there.
I wore...
Bikinis and boots is all I wore.
Yeah.
Well, there was no loneliness.
There was no boredom.
The days flew into nights, and you just couldn't keep up with the times 'cause there was so much to do.
It was always fun.
I also am keenly aware that I've entered a world that I dreamed of all my life and that it is a perfect world.
And I remember thinking of the United States as something that I had had in a dream sometime in my life, but is now gone, like it never existed!
It was a dream that I had had and I had worked myself out of it 'cause I had toiled so long in that place, in that prison... and now I'm home, now I'm free,
and there is no going back.
There, it was vast and open, and everything was natural.
Everything!
I have seen lightning in Africa not flash, but hover, and what it does is it electrifies you into complete speechlessness.
I have seen it!
I have seen God.
In my seventh grade year, Mom moved me to Liberia, but she was always traveling, and I never knew half the time if I wasn't going, that she was leaving or when she was coming back.
So I lived with a family for a year and I went to school there, and I lived with them until Mom came and decided to buy a house on the beach, and I went from living with them to living with her,
and she just...
I could never do anything right.
She went from being my comfort to the monster in my life.
Now she was the person that was doing the beating, and she was beating me.
One time, we were in public somewhere, I did something, and she just... she went off on me in front of everybody, and I didn't show any emotion because when Mom...
when Mom would see you cry, she knew she could push your buttons.
That's what she wanted, and I would not give her that satisfaction.
When she would hit me, I would look her dead in her face... and she'd be like, "You better cry.
You better cry."
I wouldn't do it.
Times got really bad, to the point where I thought about committing suicide.
So, when I was 14, I flew to New York, and I wound up living with my dad and I never went back.
After we broke up, a lot of things happened.
She didn't file taxes.
She didn't take care of business.
She lost the house in Mount Vernon.
Everything went crazy.
She lived a nomadic life, having no manager, having no husband... but she always said living in Africa was the happiest time in her life.
She could just be there, enjoy herself.
She didn't have to sing at all.
She wasn't playing piano and she wasn't performing.
She said she hated the piano.
She hated it.
Think about it.
She's playing since she was four years old.
On the other hand, she was very well aware that in Africa, no money came in.
So she had to pick up her career again.
She didn't want to return to what she called,
"The United Snakes of America."
So she moved to Switzerland, which was the complete opposite of Africa, and the first thing she did was the Montreux concert.
You on yet?
Do you hear all those noises?
You didn't forget me, huh?
That's-
- That's what's so wild, you didn't forget me.
I didn't expect you to, but I'm tired.
You don't know what I mean.
And there are many people in show business who said,
"Oh, she-
- You know, she used to be a star.
She's gone all the way to the bottom,"
and all kinds of crap which means nothing to me at all.
I hope that you will see me or see the spirit in another sphere, on another plane very soon now.
And again, I don't wanna let you down and I get this feeling.
So I think the only way to tell you who I am these days... is to sing a song by Janis Ian.

In Switzerland, there I had no money.
I never got anything from Andy.
He just cut himself off from me and I was left high and dry.
So I left Switzerland and I went to Paris, thinking that I could resume my career.
I did it alone and I landed in the wrong place.
I was working every night in a small cafe for about $300 a night.
No, we just do "Vous Etes Seuls."
It goes like this!
I was desperate and no one believed that I was there.
I was too big to be there.
No one came to see me.
And I had fallen from grace.
I'm sorry that I didn't become the world's first black classic pianist.
I think I would have been happier.
I'm not very happy now.
I wouldn't change being part of the civil rights movement.
I wouldn't change that.
But some of the songs that I sang have hurt my career.
All of the controversial songs the industry decided to punish me for... and they put a boycott on all of my records, and it's, uh... hard for me to incorporate those songs anymore because they are not relevant to the times.
In terms of the civil rights movement, how far have we come?
There aren't any civil rights!
What do you mean?
There is no reason to sing those songs.
Nothing is happening.
There's no civil rights movement.
Everybody's gone.
I met Nina in 1967 and I've been her friend all her life.
She called me in 1982 and she was here in Paris, living in a very small apartment, hardly with any money.
She did concerts of four hours long at Trois Mailletz, that nightclub, and she got a few hundred dollars a night.
And that was the worst period.
I visited her in that little apartment and it was so dirty, so I cleaned it all up and, "Nina, you can't live like this,"
but at that moment, she was still uncontrollable.
This thing in the Grand Hotel in Paris happened.
Somebody looked her in the eyes a bit too long, and she was already a bit nervous and she kind of... made a movement and I thought, "She's going to hit him."
Immediately, my arms around her, and I dragged her out in a taxi and I said to the taxi driver, "Drive!"
When I saw her in Paris, she was like a street urchin dressed in rags.
I couldn't believe what was happening and I was really, really sad.
Gerrit and I, we knew something was very wrong, and we were trying to figure out, and like, "What is it?
What is it, really?"
So Gerrit found her a condo in Nijmegen in Holland, and Gerrit had a friend, a doctor, that he brought to Nina's place, and the doctor examined her and asked her questions, and he prescribed a medication
which was kind of new... new spectrum, called Trilafon.
It wasn't till I was in my 20s and I went to visit her in Nijmegen, that's when I learned the term "manic-depressive" and "bipolar"
and I remember asking,
"Well, what is that?
What do you mean by that?"
And her mood swings and a lot of the things I dealt with earlier in life when, you know, one minute she'd be happy and then the next minute...
I'd be dealing with someone that wasn't in the room five minutes ago.
It started to make sense.
She got so deep in the shit in the end that she realized it's either dying or give in.
And she gave in because we said, "Nina... we'll get you a house, we'll get you your musicians, we'll make the things all right around you, we'll book your concerts... but you have to do as we say.
You have to take your medicine.
You have to work.
God has given you the possibility to be able to do what you do, so do it!
The only thing we want to hear is either 'yes' or 'no.'"
And she said, with tears in her eyes, "Yes."
When I saw her,
I was very concerned because she had a... a nervous tic.
You know, she'd be talking or sitting and this--
Her mouth would always be twitching, and when she would walk, it was more of a shuffle.
And I'm like, "What's going on here?"
You know, "Why--
What's going on?
What am I missing?"
And they had her on medication.
She started taking the Trilafon and the doctor said,
"Through the years, it's going to have an effect on her motor skills.
Her voice is going to start to slur and her piano abilities will decline.
You can deal with that or you can deal with her probably damaging herself or someone else."
But the Trilafon really helped.
I mean, there were times in Holland, sitting on her terrace in these lounge chairs and just holding hands...
I mean, she was like-- She was my sister.
...and not talking at all for hours, just enjoying the day.
And I suppose that medication enabled her to perform and fulfill the business dealings that were taking place so that her career could get back on track, but there were times when I questioned that, you know, "But what about her heart?"
Because at the end of the day, you guys got wives and husbands and lives, but she's alone.
My personal life is a shambles.
I've had a few love affairs and I would love to be married, but everything has had to be sacrificed for the music.
We had to do, first in Holland, eight concerts, and the word spread that Nina's doing the job well.
Then she was on the road again and it was... poof.
The business was going.
She came onstage and you had this overwhelming, emotional feeling coming from the audience just because she was there.
Now listen to me.
I love you very much.
I think you know that and I know that you love me.
I know that.
And we never knew too well what was going to happen and how the mood would be.
So this place is very hot and it's very crowded and it's very ugly.
But she opened her heart and soul at that moment.
That's this special kind of connection she had with an audience.
This song is popular all over France.
It's from our first album... the very first album we made in this world, which is at least 25 years old.
I only wish I was as wise... could have been as wise then as I have become now.
I have suffered.
But there's a Bösendorfer here, so we'll see what happens.
"My Baby Just Cares For Me."
She was helped by "My Baby Just Cares For Me,"
that song that became a hit because of the Chanel advertisement.
And when "My Baby Just Cares For Me" came along, I said,
"I have to take this opportunity now to go all over the world because this is my last chance."
And so I worked very hard to take advantage of my second coming because it was my last time as far as I was concerned.

let me listen to it again!
How is she doing this?"
He couldn't understand.

As I got older, I started to look at her and I thought to myself,
"Wow, she's from another time!"
But she was not at odds with the times.
The times was at odds with her.
I think when a person moves to their own kind of clock, spirit, flow, if we were living in an environment that allowed us to be exactly who we are, you're always in congress with yourself.
The challenge is,
"How do we fit in in the world that we're around, but we--
Are we allowed to be exactly who we are?
Was Nina Simone allowed to be exactly who she was?"
As fragile as she was strong, as vulnerable as she was dynamic, she was African royalty.
How does royalty stomp around in the mud and still walk with grace?
Most people are afraid to be as honest as she lived.

Good night!
Tremendous pleasure and honor to welcome the incredible, unique, and fantastic, one and only Nina Simone.
Hello.
Hi!
We're ready.
One, two, three.
I haven't seen you for many years, since 1968.
I have decided that I will do no more jazz festivals.
That decision has not changed.
I will sing for you, or we will do and share with you a few moments,
after which I shall graduate to a higher class, I hope, and I hope you will come with me.
We will start from the beginning, which was about a little girl,
and her name was Blue.
What's "free" to you, Nina?
- What's "free" to me?
- Yeah.
Same thing it is to you.
You tell me.
No, no, you tell me.
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.
It's just a feeling.
It's like, "How do you tell somebody how it feels to be in love?"
How are you going to tell anybody who has not been in love how it feels to be in love?
You cannot do it to save your life.
You can describe things but you can't tell them, but you know it when it happens.
That's what I mean by "free."
I've had a couple of times onstage when I really felt free, and that's something else.
That's really something else!
Like, all... all...
Like...
like...
I'll tell you what freedom is to me, no fear.
I mean, really, no fear.
If I could have that half of my life, no fear.
My mother was one of the greatest entertainers of all time, hands down... but she paid a huge price.
People seem to think that when she went out on stage, that was when she became Nina Simone.
My mother was Nina Simone 24/7... and that's where it became a problem.
When she was performing, she was brilliant, she was loved.
She was also a revolutionary.
She found a purpose for the stage, a place from which she could use her voice to speak out for her people.
But when the show ended, everybody else went home.
She was alone and she was still fighting... but she was fighting her own demons... full of anger and rage.
She couldn't live with herself... and everything fell apart.
Good evening.
Our guest tonight is Nina Simone.
Probably the foremost blues singer, jazz singer, singer of all songs in the United States today.
Nina, are you happy with the kind of work you are doing?
What makes me the happiest, is when I'm performing and there are people out there who feel with me and I know I touched them.
But to be completely honest, the whole thing seems so much like a dream.
I never thought I was gonna stay in show business.
When I first got into show business,
I wasn't a blues singer and I wasn't even a jazz singer.
I was a classical pianist.
I studied to become the first black classical pianist in America, and that's all that was on my mind.
That's what I was prepared to be.
I was born Eunice Waymon, which is my real name, by the way, in a town called Tryon, North Carolina.
I started to play the piano when I was three or four.
My mother was a preacher and she took me with her on her revivals, and I started to play the piano in church.
Revival meetings were some of the most exciting times that I've ever had.
The music was so intense, you just sort of went out of yourself.
I felt it tremendously.
I was leading it.
When I was seven, the choir of our church gave a program at the local theater, and I was on that program...
And I played some song, I don't remember what it was, and these two women, two white women, in the audience heard me.
One of them was the woman that my mother worked for, and the other one was a music teacher, Mrs. Mazzanovich, and they decided right then and there to give me lessons.
And so, for five years after that,
I studied piano, classical piano, with this teacher.
I crossed the railroad tracks every weekend to get to Mrs. Mazzanovich.
And, you know, railroad tracks in the South are supposed to be dividing the blacks from the whites.
Well, it really did.
I was so scared.
Mrs. Mazzanovich frightened me.
It was her being white, in the sense that I had never seen.
She was alien to me.
Her white hair, the combs in it, her pleasantness...
I loved that.
And she started me on Bach.
And this Bach, I liked him.
Mrs. Mazzanovich had it in her mind that I was gonna be one of the world's greatest concert pianists.
So it was all very disciplined classical music.
Bach, Beethoven, Debussy, Brahms, you name it.
Then Mrs. Mazzanovich got a fund together, "Eunice Waymon Fund,"
and I gave lots of recitals, and they would take up collection to further my education after I had left her.
Mommy took to all of the training like a fish to water, but it was a double-edged sword.
She had a very lonely life because she was practicing seven, eight hours a day.
When I first started to take lessons,
I became terribly aware of how isolated I was from the other children, and how isolated I was from the white community and the negro community.
I felt it, all the time, even when the kids used to play with me.
They always wanted me just to play the piano for them to dance.
I wasn't asked too much to do anything else.
That was very hard.
Part of that isolation, of course, was the thing about color.
I was a black girl, and I knew about it, and I lived in it.
I lived in the South for 17 years.
My mom rarely referred to Jim Crow and segregation and a lot of the racial issues that were going on at that stage in her life.
But she did tell me about times when she was told her nose was too big, her lips were too full and her skin was too dark.
And after she was told that, they probably told her,
"There's only certain things you'll be good for in your life."
What I knew, I knew.
But we weren't allowed to mention anything racial in our house.
I wasn't consciously dealing with race.
That wasn't consciously on my mind at all... until years later.
After I graduated from high school, the money that had been saved from the Eunice Waymon Fund sent me to New York to Juilliard for a year and a half.
And then I applied for a scholarship to Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
I was playing Czerny and Liszt and Rachmaninoff and Bach.
I knew I was good enough, but they turned me down, and it took me about six months to realize it was because I was black.
I never really got over that jolt of racism at the time.
Then the money ran out and the reality hit me that I had to go to work.
My parents had moved the whole family to Philadelphia to be near me, and my family is very poor, so I had to work.
What else was there for me to do?
So, I got myself a job in Atlantic City for a summer.
It was a very crummy bar and I used to go in in evening gowns.
I didn't know any better.
And I played everything that I could think of.
Pop songs, classical, spirituals, all kinds of things.
It was very strange.
And I had never sung before, and the owner came in the second night and told me if I wanted to keep the job, I had to sing.
So, $90 was more money than I had ever heard of in my life, so I said, "Well, I'll sing," and ever since then, I've been singing.
Eunice Waymon was playing in the bars to support her family and to have money to continue her classical piano training.
But since she didn't want her mother to know that she was playing "the devil's music" in bars, she changed her name.
Eunice Waymon became Nina Simone.
She named herself "Niña," meaning "little one,"
and she had a boyfriend who called her "Niña,"
and "Simone" came from the French actress Simone Signoret.
I didn't want my mother to find out.
I knew she would hate it.
So I, kind of, kept it from her for a long, long time.
Was it lonely for a young girl entertaining in these strange bars?
Extremely.
Extremely lonely.
Working peculiar hours, I imagine.
12:00 midnight to 7:00 in the morning.
It ruined your social life, uh...
Never had much of one.
- Why'd you keep on with it?
- Couldn't help it.
I have to play and I needed money.
It was always a matter of necessity from day to day what I'm going to do.
I didn't even know I was going to stay in show business.
I never thought about a choice.
From the beginning, I felt there was something eating at her.
You know, "What's eating at you, Nina?"
And, um... gradually that got stronger.
The first time I played with Nina, it was the summer of 1957 at a restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania.
She didn't look at me.
Said nothing, as though I wasn't...
I wasn't even there, and started in on a song.
She never told me what key she was going to be in.
She just started playing, and I knew exactly where I was going to go with it.
It was like we had a telepathic relationship.
Before you knew it, we were just weaving in and out.
And then she looked up.
Al Schackman is a terribly sensitive, creative man.
He has perfect pitch, which means that no matter what key I'm in, he's able to adapt himself immediately, 'cause I do that all the time.
I'll change the key in the middle of a tune.
Nina had a wonderful way of taking a piece of music, and... not interpreting it, but...
but, like, metamorphosizing it.
You know, morphing it into her experience.
What I was interested in was conveying an emotional message, which means using everything you've got inside you sometimes to barely make a note or if you have to strain to sing, you sing.
So sometimes I sound like gravel, and sometimes I sound like coffee and cream.
When I first saw Nina at my club in 1959,
I was impressed.
She was different.
She mixed in folk music with jazz.
She played very fine piano.
Her voice was totally different from anybody else.
It was a woman's voice, but it had the depth of a baritone.
That depth and that darkness carried the insight of what was in Nina's soul... and it reached you very quickly.
She was an artist.
She was an original artist.
So we paid attention, and in 1960, I put her on the Newport Jazz Festival, and she was a hit there.
Her sound is so original.
When she first appeared... she was one of those musicians who...
Once...
You don't have to hear them a bunch.
If you hear them once, then the next time you hear 'em, you say,
"Oh, that's that same one I heard last week.
Nobody sounds like that except her."
At Newport, she was sitting on a high stool with a tambourine, and I was in the back.
She wasn't sure she wanted to go through with it.
If I remember right, she was a little, you know, "What am I doing here?"
And I said, "You're here because, you know, you belong here."
And she said, "Okay, Al, but you better play."
And I said, "Don't worry, I'll play."
But then, if you watch during her performance of "Little Liza,"
she has that little smile from time to time.
She let go, and it was really cute.
Then I recorded seven or eight tunes that I had been doing all of those years, and of course, the public picked out "I Loves You Porgy."
It was not pushed or promoted to be a hit at all.
- Girls!
Guys!
Hi.
- Hi, Hugh, nice to see you.
Real good.
Eleanor, you want to, uh, take Don's coat here, and maybe you can show the girls where the powder room is and bedroom.
Hello, there.
Very nice to have you with us this evening.
This is Playboy's Penthouse, and I'm Hugh Hefner, editor/publisher of Playboy magazine.
I'd like you to meet someone that I think most of you know, Nina Simone.
She came out of nowhere in the last year as a recording star.
Now has a very, very big record in "Porgy"
that is breaking all kinds of sales records.
We're very happy she could join us
- tonight on Playboy's Penthouse...
- Thanks.
And she's going to play and sing a little bit for us now with her group.
Do you want to hear "Porgy"?
- Very much!
- Right!
Good, that's what we'll do.
Nina, there's a man named Andy Stroud.
He walked into your life and became a permanent part.
How did you meet your husband?
He came to see me at a nightclub and a mutual friend introduced us.
Nina came to the table and sat, and I was eating a hamburger plate, and there were fries, and she dipped into them.
And she wanted to know if it was okay.
I said, "All right."
We got cute and then she gave me that card with a note on it.
Then I went over to see her at her place in the next day or two.
How did you know that Andy Stroud was to be your husband and not just another guy out for a date or something else?
That's a hard question.
He told me that he had wanted to meet me for a long time.
And he had come for me.
I fell in love with him.
Then later, he scared me to death.
He was so, you know...
He knew what he wanted and he just took over.
He abandoned his own career as a sergeant of the police department to manage me, and for the first time, I knew what it was not to be just floundering out there.
I just remember meeting Andy.
Here was a tough, New York, you know, vice squad cop, that when he stepped out of his car uptown, people ran.
And he had... he had a way of just saying one word...
"Hey."
and that could put a lot of fear in people.
But Andy and Nina married in 1961.
He retired from the police force and became her manager, and he did well for her.
They bought a beautiful house in Mount Vernon, New York.
We had a 13-room house, four acres of land, lot of trees.
And Lisa was born nine months later.
The first three hours after Lisa was born were the most peaceful in my life, and I was in love with the world.
And Andrew was there.
He was sitting right there, and he said...
I said, "How's the baby?" He says, "How's the mother?"
And I loved him for that.
I loved being a mother.
I was a good mother.
I was a goddamn good mother.
I remember our house in Mount Vernon like the back of my hand.
It was like a fairy tale.
I remember seeing the paisley on the walls.
The walls were kind of like a...
They were hued in gold, but it really wasn't gold.
It was more like a muted gold but it felt like it was velvet.
So I'd always run my hands, like, over the walls, because it was textured.
And my mom, she had her cold storage where she kept her fur coats and her costumes.
So I was always in there.
These were the good, sweet days.
We were building and growing together.
I had an overall plan to develop and create her as an artist.
I had set up an office at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street.
I had a publicist.
I had a guy who was a record-promotion man that I got from Atlantic Records.
I had another fellow who did the college radio station promotion, and a photographer.
Dad was the original Puff Daddy.
I mean, he really had a vision, and he was a very astute businessman.
And of course, she was burning to get on to Carnegie Hall.
She had trained as a classical pianist with the one thought in mind of being the first black female classical pianist to appear in Carnegie Hall.
That was her prime objective.
However, none of the New York City promoters would undertake this project.
So, I took my own money to promote the appearance.
She was ecstatic.
I mean, she was out of her mind with joy.
You apparently wrote a letter to your parents saying,
"This is where you wanted me to play,
- but I should have been playing Bach." - "Playing Bach."
So this was your glory occasion, but you were still disappointed?
Well, I loved the audience, but I wasn't playing classical music, and I wanted to be, and so I wrote,
"Yes, I'm in Carnegie Hall, finally, but I'm not playing Bach."
After Carnegie Hall, she was getting airplay all over the country, magazine pictures and stories.
She became highly successful and recognized.
- Oh!
Thank you very much!
- Meeting in Japan.
A young woman who's made a very emphatic name for herself...
An accomplished pianist and distinctive... who's now become a rather famous artist.
A remarkable blues-soul sound.
For the first time on British television,
The High Priestess of Soul...
- Nina Simone.
- Nina Simone.
The great Nina Simone.
Miss Simone brings to her music a kind of technique and discipline we generally associate with classical music.
She has introduced fugue and counterpoint into the freewheeling spontaneity of the jazz world.
Nina, do you think that now that you are successful as a popular artist that you'd like to do any classical?
Yes, but I don't have time to think about it too much.
But you have to realize that when I'm most satisfied with my music,
I call upon all of the things that I have learned in classical music.
She wanted everything that money and success could buy.
So I promised her that she was going to be a rich black bitch.
We had a blackboard and he used to put on there,
"I'll be a rich black bitch by this such-and-such date,"
and he said, "Then you could quit," and I always believed him, but I never could quit because he worked me too hard.
Andy said, "Nina, it's hard work.
You wanna make the money, you have to work."
And she resented that.
Then Lisa was born, and she resented being torn away, having to go on the road.
I didn't realize what my mom did for a living.
I just know that Mom was always traveling.
My mother often told me that I had 13 nannies in seven years.
So, while she was trying to maintain some sense of a schedule for me and normalcy for me, she was out there doing what she was doing.
Can I have five more minutes?
It's very frustrating...
When we were on the road, there were times we had to be careful.
She could get angry and start arguments with people.
Y'all pushing!
You're pushing!
Don't put nothin' in it!
Let's do it again.
If anyone were talking in the audience, she would just sit, and at first, she would say, "Please..."
and she said, "I'm not continuing."
She'd get up, walk out, and the gig was over.
I just want them to listen to the music like they did in the classical world.
I thought they needed teaching.
If they couldn't listen, fuck it!
She got into Carnegie Hall, and she got the big house in the country, but she began questioning herself.
She'd get into moods of depression about the whole business, the personal relationship, cursing and smashing things, and this worsened as the time went by.
All I did was work, work, work.
I was always tired.
I was always tired.
I could never sleep.
You see, music always goes through my head, which means the more I played, the less I could relax.
I kept thinking Andy would let me rest.
He never did.
She felt she was being handled like a racehorse, and she was always fighting, fighting, fighting it.
Andy would say, "Nina, we've got a career here.
That's not going to continue if you don't nurture it."
So, she came to resent Andy... but she was afraid of Andy.
Andrew protected me against everybody but himself.
He wrapped himself around me like a snake.
I worked like a dog, and I was scared of him... and Andrew beat me up.
But I've never talked to you about this.
But he beat me up.
I was deathly scared of Andrew.
One time, early in the morning, like 4:00, 5:00 in the morning, uh... the phone rings.
It's Nina, and she needed to hide out.
I had gone to a discotheque with Andrew... and a fan came up to me and gave me a note, and he saw me take this note and put it in my pocket.
She thought nothing of it.
I mean, she related this to me.
And Andy came back and grabbed her arm and took her out from the place and beat her up.
And when I got out on the street, he started raining blows on me.
Bloody blows.
He beat me all the way home, up the stairs, in the elevator, in my room, put a gun to my head.
Then he tied me up and raped me.
She came to my place and...
and she was beat up.
And I, you know, put her to bed, and... and she, you know, rested for a couple of days.
He didn't find me for two weeks.
My eyes, I couldn't see.
And he said, "Who beat you up like that?"
And I said, "You did!"
He said, "No, I didn't.
I've been looking for you for two weeks."
I said, "You're insane!"
He was brutal...
but I...
I loved him and I guess I just believed he wouldn't do it anymore.
My mother always said, till the day she died,
Dad was the best manager that she ever had.
But on top of being charismatic, he could be a bully and he could be very mean, and she was on the receiving end of that... more times than, you know, she should have been,
which should have been never.
Mom would allude to, you know,
"He's rammed my head into a concrete wall."
She said that he punched her in the stomach when she was pregnant with me.
As a child, I remember sitting in the car between them and they were arguing about something, and I remember my father reaching across me, so it was like this, and backhanding her.
We're going home in the car, I'm driving, and I slapped her.
Blood spurted...
right over this eyebrow.
She had, like, a one-inch cut from my ring, you know.
We got her home and I clipped the skin together and taped it... and a week later, there wasn't even a scar.
I think they were both nuts.
She stayed with him.
She had this love affair with fire.
That's like inviting the bull with the red cape,
"Just come on into my kitchen and let's see what we can do."
That's what she did.
- What do I want for her?
- Yes.
Myself.
What else?
Career-wise.
My father had a strategic plan in terms of how Mom's career was going to go.
He wanted her to be able to win all the awards, and to become the huge star that he knew that she could be... but she wanted something more.
There was something missing in her, some meaning.
They died in Birmingham, the nation's most segregated big city.
Dynamite exploded on Sunday morning, killed four little girls, injured 20 other Negroes.
It was one of more than 40 bombings in that Birmingham area.
Kids were murdered in Birmingham on a Sunday and in Sunday schools in a Christian nation, and nobody cares!
When the kids got killed in that church... that did it.
First you get depressed, and after that, you get mad.
And when these kids got bombed,
I just sat down and wrote this song.
And it's a very...
moving, violent song, 'cause that's how I feel about the whole thing.
"Mississippi Goddam."
Phew!
Hmm?
Got my attention.
What she was doing was different.
There's something about a woman... if you look at all the suffering that black folks went through... not one black man would dare say, "Mississippi, goddam."
And then to have someone with her stature talking about your problem, you know how happy they had to be?
We all wanted to say it.
She said it.
"Mississippi, goddam!"
For Mommy to write a song called "Mississippi Goddam"
was revolutionary.
They didn't have cursing on the radio or on television or anything.
DJ's refused to play it, and boxes of the 45s used to be sent back from the radio stations cracked in two.
As the civil rights movement really swung into high gear, she swung into high gear with it.
In '65, we played at the Selma March in Montgomery, Alabama.
We have a legal and constitutional right to march from Selma to Montgomery!
It was extremely dangerous.
The federal Marshals were called in, and they were standing on the tops of all the buildings downtown with guns.
Seated in front of the stage facing the audience was Martin Luther King,
Ralph Bunche from the UN and a lot of other worldwide dignitaries.
You had Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Sidney Poitier,
Bill Cosby, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Belafonte, and we did "Mississippi Goddam."
My mother said that after she sang that song, she got so angry that her voice broke... and from "Mississippi Goddam" on, it never, ever returned to its former octave.
But I think that Mom's anger is what sustained her.
The energy and the creativity and the passion of those days is really what kept her going.
When she wrote "Mississippi Goddam,"
I thought it was something else.
You know, I liked it.
They put a 45 out on it, and I knew it had a lot of impact.
But my complaint was that while I was always pushing for the commercial side of the picture, she got sidetracked with all of these civil rights activities.
When the civil rights thing came up, all of a sudden,
I could let myself be heard about what I'd been feeling all the time.
When I was young, I knew to stay alive.
As a black family, we had to work at it.
We had to keep secrets.
We never complained about being poor, or being taken advantage of or not getting our share.
We had to keep our mouths shut as I walked across that railroad track every Saturday.
So I knew to break the silence meant a confrontation with the white people of that town.
And though I didn't know I knew it, if the black man rises up and says, "I'm just not gonna do that anymore..."
he stands to get murdered.
But no one mentioned that, which is, indeed, quite strange.
It touched me first time when I gave a recital at this library.
Everybody was seated and they told me my parents had to sit in the back, and I said,
"If they have to sit in the back, I won't perform."
They fixed it that time and they brought them to the front and they let them sit down, but it was my first feeling of being discriminated against, and I recoiled in horror at such a thing.
I choose to reflect the times and the situations in which I find myself.
That, to me, is my duty... and at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when every day is a matter of survival,
I don't think you can help but be involved.
Young people, black and white, know this, and so that's why they're so involved in politics.
We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore.
So I don't think you have a choice...
How can you be an artist and not reflect the times?
I've always thought that I was shaking people up, but now I want to go at it more and I want to go at it more deliberately and I want to go at it coldly.
I want...
I want to shake people up so bad that when they leave a nightclub where I've performed,
I just want them to be to pieces.
All right!
I want to go in that den of those elegant people with their old ideas, smugness, and just drive them insane.
Rise up!
It's all right if you dance slow!
But it was very exhilarating to be part of that movement at the time because I was needed.
Now I could sing to help my people, and that became the mainstay of my life.
Not classical piano, not classical music, not even popular music, but civil rights music.
I got to know Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Andrew Young, and artists, actors, actresses, poets, writers, people like myself who felt compelled to make the stand that I have.
It was very important for her to connect with the writers and playwrights of that moment because those people had the intellectual background of the movement and she didn't have that.
She had music, the musical background.
For instance, Langston Hughes, he wrote the lyrics for "Backlash Blues" for her.
Lorraine Hansberry, Nina took her play, Young, Gifted, and Black, and made a song out of it.
It's regarded as one of the most important songs in the civil rights movement.
I know that there are only 300 black students here in this college of 18,000.
So this song is dedicated only to you.
Lorraine Hansberry was my best friend, and she wrote plays, Raisin in the Sun and Young, Gifted, and Black.
She taught me a lot about Karl Marx, Lenin, philosophy.
The basic fabric of our society that has Negroes in the situation that they are in is the thing which must be changed, you know.
Those times were pretty amazing.
I look back now and I'm just like, "Wow!
Who's who of Black America!"
Lorraine Hansberry was my godmother.
Malcolm X's wife, Betty Shabazz, was my auntie.
They lived right next door in Mount Vernon.
There are six daughters and I was like the seventh.
So I was always riding my bike over there.
Lisa and I were the same age, and...
I think we may have called one another twins.
It was just a great, great time.
There was music, there were discussions.
Whether it was at our house or Lisa's house, Nina Simone's home, it was definitely party with a purpose.
We happened to be a fly on the wall with some of the genius poets and poetesses of the time, the era.
And to sit in that room and listen...
These were brilliant, well-read, well-traveled, charming, alluring, charismatic people who were moved to make a difference in the world.
I'm born of the Young, Gifted, and Black affirmation.
For me, and those of us in that environment, it was daring to proclaim it... and then share it joyously when she sang it.
People would stand up and engage in their African-ness without apology... and it's a contemporary, hip song of the era.
It means you get to hum it in public.
She became a legend in the activists' movement, and through meetings and discussions that I overheard, she was convinced that certain things must be done in order to...
push the revolution.
I told them that's not the answer, and then it began to manifest in her attitude towards me and the business.
She'd fly off.
I remember a few nights, you know, you go to bed happy and holding one another.
I wake up, and she'd be sitting up in bed with her arms folded, looking at me, thinking about killing me.
And this is how it went.
The political work became very heavy.
To me, we are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world, black people.
So my job is to make them more curious about where they came from and their own identity and pride in that identity.
That's why my songs...
I try to make them as powerful as possible, mostly just to make them curious about themselves.
We don't know anything about ourselves.
We don't even have the pride and the dignity of African people, but we can't even talk about where we came from.
We don't know.
It's like a lost race.
I really mean to provoke this feeling of, like, "Who am I?
Where'd I come from?"
You know, "Do I really like me?" and, "Why do I like me?"
And, like, you know, "If I am black and beautiful,
I really am and I know it, and I don't care who cares or says what."
This is what compels me to push black people to identify with black culture.
Giving out to them that black-ness, that black power.
Nina was a real rebel.
She didn't really fit in the revolutionary black female role that was offered her.
She could avoid pretentious phoniness and get more depth out of a song than people are used to hearing out of those songs.
She was a kind of patron saint of the rebellion.
Nina started to get more aggressive.
I remember one time as she walked right up to Dr. King and said,
"I'm not non-violent!"
And he said, "That's okay, sister.
You don't have to be."
I was never non-violent.
Never.
I thought we should get our rights by any means necessary.
And then she met Stokely Carmichael.
Miss Simone says something very significant in her song "Mississippi Goddam."
She says, "This country..." She says, "This country is built on lies."
You're gonna sit in front of your television set and listen to LBJ tell you that,
"Violence never accomplishes anything, my fellow Americans."
And the honky drafting you out of school to go fight in Vietnam.
If you don't want any trouble, keep your filthy white hands off our beautiful black skin.
Keep them off!
I am just one of the people who is sick of the social order, sick of the establishment, sick to my soul of it all.
To me, America's society is nothing but a cancer, and it must be exposed before it can be cured.
I am not the doctor to cure it.
All I can do is expose the sickness.
Are you ready, black people?
Yeah!
Are you ready, black people?
Yeah!
- Are you really ready?
- Yeah!
She wanted to align herself with the extreme terrorist militants who were influencing her.
And after all of these meetings with all these people, she would come to me and,
"Let's get the guns.
Let's poison the reservoir."
All sorts of violent terrorist acts.
Are you ready to call the wrath of black gods... black magic...
Yeah!
To do your bidding?
Black people are never going to get their rights unless they have their own separate state.
And if we'd have armed revolution, there'd be a lot of blood.
I think we'd have that separate state.
Are you ready to smash white things?
Yeah!
To burn buildings, are you ready?
Yeah!
At a certain point, Nina started to play only political songs and nothing else, and that started to hurt her career.
That became a problem to book her, because promoters were a little bit afraid that it might only be the political message that you were getting.
Are you ready to kill if necessary?
Yeah!
Is your mind ready?
Yeah!
- Is your body ready?
- Yeah!
If I'd had my way, I'd have been a killer.
I would have had guns, and I would have gone to the South and gave them violence for violence, shotgun for shotgun, but my husband told me...
I didn't know anything about guns, and he refused to teach me, and the only thing I had was music, so I obeyed him.
But if I'd had my way, I wouldn't be sitting here today.
I'd be probably dead.
Are you really, really, really ready?
Yeah!
She's putting down the white people...
I mean, you know, like a barking dog, but she still wanted all the good things.
Whenever she'd see, like, Aretha Franklin and Gladys Knight and all of these people on the prime television shows, she, of course, was very upset because she wasn't able to get on to these shows because of her reputation.
It got so that there wasn't that much work and the expenses were high.
It was cutting the legs out from all the work that I had done.
See you later.
I'll see you later.
I remember my dad complaining about the fact that she never stopped speaking out, but that's who she was.
It was okay when you were onstage.
It's okay 'cause you let it all hang out, and then when the show ends and the lights go out,
"Okay, let's put the monkey back in the cage, and eat your banana and, you know, just behave yourself."
It was like she was penalized and punished for being herself.
That's a very painful, lonely place to be.
Good evening.
Tonight my guest in the studio with me needs almost no introduction.
She is Miss Nina Simone.
Nina, when it comes to the artists today, we find that more of the artists are attempting to alert America to the need for change.
Is this really the artist's role?
Well, I think it's something that, um, I have chosen to do and I have felt compelled to do it.
So it is my role... but sometimes, I wish it wasn't.
I think that the artists who don't get involved in preaching messages probably are happier, but you see, I have to live with Nina, and that is very difficult.
I think 19 people depend on me for their livelihood.
That's a hell of a lot of people.
I know that if I say, "Well, look, I'm too tired to work tonight,"
I'm gonna get it from both ends.
Nobody's going to understand or care that I'm too tired.
I'm very aware of that.
Now, I would like some freedom, somewhere... where I didn't feel those pressures.
By the late '60s, I realized that Nina was fighting demons that could appear at any moment and you wouldn't know it.
She could get violent, she could get really physical, and the change in her would be dramatic... boom, like a switch.
And I...
I, after a while, realized that I was...
I wasn't with my sister, I was with "that one..."
and that one was... menacing.
She was very concerned, in her sane moments, about these fits of depression and anger.
We even went to Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital,
I think, signed her in for four or five days.
They conducted every test known to... medicine at the time and they were unable to find anything.
And her downward spiral, it just got worse and worse.
We did a tour with Bill Cosby, and the last night, she became erratic.
She had a can of shoe polish.
She was putting it in her hair.
And she began talking gibberish, and she was totally out of it, incoherent.
It appeared she was having a nervous breakdown.
And when it came time to go on,
I had to escort her by holding her arm onto the stage and sat her down at the piano, and I immediately stood in the wings on the opposite side where we could see one another.
She's watching me pantomime and she performed.
Basically, she had no control over her emotions, and underneath it all, sex dominated her.
There were times, once or twice a week, when there was a sex attack when she goes into a maniacal rage.
There had to be sex.
I mean, this is driving her.
My attitude towards sex was that we should have it all the time.
How did Andy act towards you?
I just wanted him to move me sexually, and he never was able to.
Right.
He didn't know how to touch me and he never had enough time.
He'd come to see me late at night and be there two hours and leave.
I knew that she was dating other people.
We agreed that we could both have our own outside partners... but we would work together for the sake of the business and the child.
I can't sit here and speak about Aunt Nina and Uncle Andy's marriage.
What I can say is that participation and activism during the '60s... rendered chaos in any individual's lives.
People sacrificed sanity, well-being, life.
Nina Simone was a free spirit in an era that didn't really appreciate a woman's genius.
So what does that do to a household and a family?
Not because of income, but because of your soul not being able to do what you need to do.
Direct from our newsroom in Washington, this is the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite.
Good evening.
Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
Jesus!
Jesus.
There was shock in the nation's negro communities.
Men, women and children poured into the streets.
They appeared dazed.
Many were crying.
I think White America made its biggest mistake when she killed Dr. King last night.
He was the one man in our race who was trying to teach our people to have love, compassion, and mercy for what white people had done.
When White America killed Dr. King last night, she killed all reasonable hope.
We want to do a tune written... for today... for this hour for Dr. Martin Luther King.
We had yesterday to learn it, and... so we'll see.
Last year, Lorraine Hansberry left us, and she was a dear friend, and then Langston Hughes left us.
Who can go on?
Do you realize how many we have lost?
Then it really gets down to reality, doesn't it?
Not a performance.
Not microphones and all that crap, but really something else.
We can't afford any more losses.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
They're shooting us down, one by one.
Don't forget that... 'cause they are... killing us one by one.
I knew that we were lost.
I felt chased all the time, no matter what I did or how sad I got.
I felt that there was just no life for me in the country.
I knew I had to quit or I had to leave Andy or do something.
So I took my ring off, put it on the table... and I left the country.
According to my godsister Attallah Shabazz...
I was staying with them, and Mom had gone away, and the phone would ring and whenever it would ring,
I would go running, saying, "Is that my mommy on the phone?"
And then I remember going back to the house in Mount Vernon and Dad just wasn't there.
He wasn't there.
And nobody told me anything, you know?
And, um, so...
One day you're at home and the staff is there and your dad's there and the dog's there and everything that's familiar to you is there, and then you come back, I don't know, weeks later
and... nothing's there, nobody's there.
I decided that I wanted to go to Africa to live and never come back to America.
I got a divorce from Andy and I went to Liberia... and I moved there to stay.
When I got to Africa, I am happy, I'm beyond happy.
Liberia is a place that was founded by the American slaves, and it only makes sense that I should feel at home there.
I wore...
Bikinis and boots is all I wore.
Yeah.
Well, there was no loneliness.
There was no boredom.
The days flew into nights, and you just couldn't keep up with the times 'cause there was so much to do.
It was always fun.
I also am keenly aware that I've entered a world that I dreamed of all my life and that it is a perfect world.
And I remember thinking of the United States as something that I had had in a dream sometime in my life, but is now gone, like it never existed!
It was a dream that I had had and I had worked myself out of it 'cause I had toiled so long in that place, in that prison... and now I'm home, now I'm free,
and there is no going back.
There, it was vast and open, and everything was natural.
Everything!
I have seen lightning in Africa not flash, but hover, and what it does is it electrifies you into complete speechlessness.
I have seen it!
I have seen God.
In my seventh grade year, Mom moved me to Liberia, but she was always traveling, and I never knew half the time if I wasn't going, that she was leaving or when she was coming back.
So I lived with a family for a year and I went to school there, and I lived with them until Mom came and decided to buy a house on the beach, and I went from living with them to living with her,
and she just...
I could never do anything right.
She went from being my comfort to the monster in my life.
Now she was the person that was doing the beating, and she was beating me.
One time, we were in public somewhere, I did something, and she just... she went off on me in front of everybody, and I didn't show any emotion because when Mom...
when Mom would see you cry, she knew she could push your buttons.
That's what she wanted, and I would not give her that satisfaction.
When she would hit me, I would look her dead in her face... and she'd be like, "You better cry.
You better cry."
I wouldn't do it.
Times got really bad, to the point where I thought about committing suicide.
So, when I was 14, I flew to New York, and I wound up living with my dad and I never went back.
After we broke up, a lot of things happened.
She didn't file taxes.
She didn't take care of business.
She lost the house in Mount Vernon.
Everything went crazy.
She lived a nomadic life, having no manager, having no husband... but she always said living in Africa was the happiest time in her life.
She could just be there, enjoy herself.
She didn't have to sing at all.
She wasn't playing piano and she wasn't performing.
She said she hated the piano.
She hated it.
Think about it.
She's playing since she was four years old.
On the other hand, she was very well aware that in Africa, no money came in.
So she had to pick up her career again.
She didn't want to return to what she called,
"The United Snakes of America."
So she moved to Switzerland, which was the complete opposite of Africa, and the first thing she did was the Montreux concert.
You on yet?
Do you hear all those noises?
You didn't forget me, huh?
That's...
That's what's so wild, you didn't forget me.
I didn't expect you to, but I'm tired.
You don't know what I mean.
And there are many people in show business who said,
"Oh, she...
You know, she used to be a star.
She's gone all the way to the bottom,"
and all kinds of crap which means nothing to me at all.
I hope that you will see me or see the spirit in another sphere, on another plane very soon now.
And again, I don't wanna let you down and I get this feeling.
So I think the only way to tell you who I am these days... is to sing a song by Janis Ian.
Hey, girl, sit down!
Sit down!
Sit down!
In Switzerland, there I had no money.
I never got anything from Andy.
He just cut himself off from me and I was left high and dry.
So I left Switzerland and I went to Paris, thinking that I could resume my career.
I did it alone and I landed in the wrong place.
I was working every night in a small cafe for about $300 a night.
No, we just do "Vous Etes Seuls."
It goes like this!
I was desperate and no one believed that I was there.
I was too big to be there.
No one came to see me.
And I had fallen from grace.
I'm sorry that I didn't become the world's first black classic pianist.
I think I would have been happier.
I'm not very happy now.
I wouldn't change being part of the civil rights movement.
I wouldn't change that.
But some of the songs that I sang have hurt my career.
All of the controversial songs the industry decided to punish me for... and they put a boycott on all of my records, and it's, uh... hard for me to incorporate those songs anymore because they are not relevant to the times.
In terms of the civil rights movement, how far have we come?
There aren't any civil rights!
What do you mean?
There is no reason to sing those songs.
Nothing is happening.
There's no civil rights movement.
Everybody's gone.
I met Nina in 1967 and I've been her friend all her life.
She called me in 1982 and she was here in Paris, living in a very small apartment, hardly with any money.
She did concerts of four hours long at Trois Mailletz, that nightclub, and she got a few hundred dollars a night.
And that was the worst period.
I visited her in that little apartment and it was so dirty, so I cleaned it all up and, "Nina, you can't live like this,"
but at that moment, she was still uncontrollable.
This thing in the Grand Hotel in Paris happened.
Somebody looked her in the eyes a bit too long, and she was already a bit nervous and she kind of... made a movement and I thought, "She's going to hit him."
Immediately, my arms around her, and I dragged her out in a taxi and I said to the taxi driver, "Drive!"
When I saw her in Paris, she was like a street urchin dressed in rags.
I couldn't believe what was happening and I was really, really sad.
Gerrit and I, we knew something was very wrong, and we were trying to figure out, and like, "What is it?
What is it, really?"
So Gerrit found her a condo in Nijmegen in Holland, and Gerrit had a friend, a doctor, that he brought to Nina's place, and the doctor examined her and asked her questions, and he prescribed a medication
which was kind of new... new spectrum, called Trilafon.
It wasn't till I was in my 20s and I went to visit her in Nijmegen, that's when I learned the term "manic-depressive" and "bipolar"
and I remember asking,
"Well, what is that?
What do you mean by that?"
And her mood swings and a lot of the things I dealt with earlier in life when, you know, one minute she'd be happy and then the next minute...
I'd be dealing with someone that wasn't in the room five minutes ago.
It started to make sense.
She got so deep in the shit in the end that she realized it's either dying or give in.
And she gave in because we said, "Nina... we'll get you a house, we'll get you your musicians, we'll make the things all right around you, we'll book your concerts... but you have to do as we say.
You have to take your medicine.
You have to work.
God has given you the possibility to be able to do what you do, so do it!
The only thing we want to hear is either 'yes' or 'no.'"
And she said, with tears in her eyes, "Yes."
When I saw her,
I was very concerned because she had a... a nervous tic.
You know, she'd be talking or sitting and this...
Her mouth would always be twitching, and when she would walk, it was more of a shuffle.
And I'm like, "What's going on here?"
You know, "Why...
What's going on?
What am I missing?"
And they had her on medication.
She started taking the Trilafon and the doctor said,
"Through the years, it's going to have an effect on her motor skills.
Her voice is going to start to slur and her piano abilities will decline.
You can deal with that or you can deal with her probably damaging herself or someone else."
But the Trilafon really helped.
I mean, there were times in Holland, sitting on her terrace in these lounge chairs and just holding hands...
I mean, she was like...
She was my sister.
And not talking at all for hours, just enjoying the day.
And I suppose that medication enabled her to perform and fulfill the business dealings that were taking place so that her career could get back on track, but there were times when I questioned that, you know, "But what about her heart?"
Because at the end of the day, you guys got wives and husbands and lives, but she's alone.
My personal life is a shambles.
I've had a few love affairs and I would love to be married, but everything has had to be sacrificed for the music.
We had to do, first in Holland, eight concerts, and the word spread that Nina's doing the job well.
Then she was on the road again and it was... poof.
The business was going.
She came onstage and you had this overwhelming, emotional feeling coming from the audience just because she was there.
Now listen to me.
I love you very much.
I think you know that and I know that you love me.
I know that.
And we never knew too well what was going to happen and how the mood would be.
So this place is very hot and it's very crowded and it's very ugly.
But she opened her heart and soul at that moment.
That's this special kind of connection she had with an audience.
This song is popular all over France.
It's from our first album... the very first album we made in this world, which is at least 25 years old.
I only wish I was as wise... could have been as wise then as I have become now.
I have suffered.
But there's a Bösendorfer here, so we'll see what happens.
"My Baby Just Cares For Me."
She was helped by "My Baby Just Cares For Me,"
that song that became a hit because of the Chanel advertisement.
And when "My Baby Just Cares For Me" came along, I said,
"I have to take this opportunity now to go all over the world because this is my last chance."
And so I worked very hard to take advantage of my second coming because it was my last time as far as I was concerned.
And she was happiest doing music.
I think that was her salvation.
That's the one thing that she didn't have to think about.
When she sat at the piano, her fingers could fly.
She was an anomaly.
She was a genius.
She was brilliant, and that brilliance shone through no matter what she was going through.
Even into her old age, she was brilliant.
She was genius.
She could do whatever she liked.
And when she didn't have her medicine, she, musically, could get even further out.
In one of those little concerts, and it's recorded, she starts playing one song and she sings another.
And this recording, I made Miles Davis... while we were on tour, we were on the same jazz tour as Miles Davis, and I made him listen to it, and he said, "Gerrit...
let me listen to it again!
How is she doing this?"
He couldn't understand.
As I got older, I started to look at her and I thought to myself,
"Wow, she's from another time!"
But she was not at odds with the times.
The times was at odds with her.
I think when a person moves to their own kind of clock, spirit, flow, if we were living in an environment that allowed us to be exactly who we are, you're always in congress with yourself.
The challenge is,
"How do we fit in in the world that we're around, but we...
Are we allowed to be exactly who we are?
Was Nina Simone allowed to be exactly who she was?"
As fragile as she was strong, as vulnerable as she was dynamic, she was African royalty.
How does royalty stomp around in the mud and still walk with grace?
Most people are afraid to be as honest as she lived.
Good night!
Tremendous pleasure and honour to welcome the incredible, unique and fantastic one and only Nina Simone!
Hello.
Hi.
We're ready.
One, two, three.
I haven't seen you for many years since 1968.
I've decided that I will do no more jazz festivals.
That decision has not changed.
I will sing for you, or we will do and share with you a few moments,
after which I shall graduate to a higher class, I hope, and I hope you will come with me.
We'll start from the beginning, which was about a little girl,
and her name was Blue.
What's "free" to you?
- What's "free" to me?
- Yeah.
Same thing it is to you.
You tell me.
No, you tell me.
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.
It's just a feeling.
It's like, "How do you tell somebody how it feels to be in love?"
How are you going to tell anybody who has not been in love how it feels to be in love?
You cannot do it to save your life.
You can describe things but you can't tell them.
But you know it when it happens.
That's what I mean by "free".
I've had a couple of times on stage when I really felt free!
And that's something else.
That's really something else!
Like...
I tell you what freedom is to me: no fear!
I mean really, no fear.
If I could have that...
Half of my life...
No fear.
My mother was one of the greatest entertainers of all time, hands down.
But she paid a huge price.
People seem to think when she went out on stage, that was when she became Nina Simone.
My mother was Nina Simone 24/7 and that's where it became a problem.
When she was performing she was brilliant.
She was loved.
She was also a revolutionary.
She found a purpose for the stage, a place from which she could use her voice to speak out for her people.
But when the show ended, everybody else went home.
She was alone and she was still fighting.
But she was fighting her own demons, full of anger and rage.
She couldn't live with herself.
And everything fell apart.
Good evening.
Our guest tonight is Nina Simone.
Probably the foremost blues singer, jazz singer, singer of all songs in the United States today.
Nina, are you happy with the kind of work you're doing?
What makes me the happiest, is when I'm performing and there are people out there who feel with me and I know I touched them.
But to be completely honest, the whole thing seems so much like a dream.
I never thought I was gonna stay in show business.
When I first got into show business
I wasn't a blues singer and I wasn't even a jazz singer.
I was a classical pianist.
I studied to become the first black classical pianist in America.
And that's all that was on my mind.
That's what I was prepared to be.
I was born Eunice Waymon, which is my real name, by the way, in a town called Tryon, North Carolina.
I started to play the piano when I was three or four.
My mother was a preacher and she took me with her on her revivals and I started to play the piano in church.
Revival meetings were some of the most exciting times that I've ever had.
The music was so intense you sort of went out of yourself.
I felt it tremendously.
And I was leading it.
When I was seven, the choir of our church gave a programme at the local theatre.
And I was on that programme.
And I played some song, I don't remember what it was, and these two white women in the audience heard me.
One of them was the woman that my mother worked for, and the other one was a music teacher, Mrs Mazzanovich.
And they decided right then and there to give me lessons.
And so, for five years after that,
I studied classical piano with this teacher.
I crossed the railroad tracks every weekend to get to Mrs Mazzanovich.
And railroad tracks in the South were supposed to be dividing the blacks from the whites.
Well, it really did.
I was so scared.
Mrs Mazzanovich frightened me.
It was her being white in the sense that I had never seen.
She was alien to me.
Her white hair, the combs in it, her pleasantness...
I loved that.
She started me on...
Bach.
And this Bach...
I liked him.
Mrs Mazzanovich had it in her mind that I was going to be one of the world's greatest concert pianists.
So it was all very disciplined classical music.
Bach, Beethoven, Debussy, Brahms, you name it.
Then Mrs Mazzanovich got a fund together,
"Eunice Waymon fund".
And I gave lots of recitals.
They would take up collection to further my education after I'd have left her.
Mommy took to all the training like a fish to water, but it was a double-edged sword.
She had a very lonely life because she was practising seven, eight hours a day.
When I first started to take lessons,
I became terribly aware of how isolated I was from the other children.
And how isolated I was from the white community and the negro community.
I felt it, all the time, even when the kids played with me.
They always wanted me just to play piano for them to dance
I wasn't asked too much to do anything else.
That was very hard.
Part of that isolation, was the thing about colour.
I was a black girl and I knew about it, and I lived in it.
I lived in the South for 17years.
My mom rarely referred to Jim Crow and segregation and a lot of the racial issues that were going on at that stage in her life.
She did tell me about times when they told her nose was too big, her lips were too full and her skin was too dark.
And after she was told that, they probably told her,
"There's only certain things you'll be good for in life."
What I knew, I knew.
We weren't allowed to mention anything racial in our house.
I wasn't consciously dealing with race.
That wasn't consciously on my mind at all.
Until years later.
After I graduated from high school, the money that had been saved from the Eunice Waymon Fund sent me to New York, to Juilliard for a year and a half.
Then I applied for a scholarship to Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
I was playing Czerny and Liszt, Rachmaninoff and Bach.
I knew I was good enough but they turned me down.
It took me about six months to realise it was because I was black.
I never really got over that jolt of racism at the time.
Then the money ran out and the reality hit me that I had to go to work.
My parents had moved the family to Philadelphia to be near me.
And my family is very poor, so I had to work.
What else was there for me to do?
I got myself a job in Atlantic City for a summer.
It was a very crummy bar.
I used to go in evening gowns.
I didn't know any better.
I played everything that I could think of.
Pop songs, classical, spirituals, all kinds of things.
It was very strange.
And I had never sung before.
The owner came in the second night and told me if I wanted to keep the job, I had to sing.
$90 was more money than I had ever heard of in my life.
So I said: "Well, I'll sing." Ever since I've been singing.
Eunice Waymon was playing in bars to support her family and to have money to continue her classical piano training.
Since she didn't want her mother to know that she was playing the "devil's music" in bars, she changed her name.
Eunice Waymon became Nina Simone.
She named herself "Niña", meaning "little one".
She had a boyfriend who called her "Niña", and "Simone" came from the French actress Simone Signoret.
I didn't want my mother to find out.
I knew she would hate it.
I kept it from her for a long, long time.
Was it lonely for a young girl entertaining in these strange bars?
Extremely.
Extremely lonely.
Working peculiar hours, I imagine.
12:00 midnight till 7:00 in the morning.
- It ruined your social life.
- Never had much of one.
- Why did you keep on with it?
- I couldn't help it.
I have to play and I needed money.
It was always a matter of necessity from day to day what I am going to do...
I didn't even know I was going to stay in show business.
I never thought about a choice.
From the beginning,
I felt there was something eating at her.
You know, "What's eating at you, Nina?"
Gradually that got stronger.
The first time I played with Nina, it was the summer of 1957 at a restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania.
She didn't look at me, said nothing as if I wasn't even there, and started in on a song.
She never told me what key she was going to be in.
She started playing and I knew exactly where I was going to go with it.
It was like we had a telepathic relationship.
Before you knew it, we were just weaving in and out
And then she looked up.
Al Schackman is a terribly sensitive, creative man.
He has perfect pitch, which means that no matter what key I'm in, he's able to adapt himself immediately.
'Cause I do that all the time.
I change the key in the middle of a tune.
Nina had a wonderful way of taking a piece of music and... not interpreting it but metamorphosising it.
You know, morphing it into her experience.
What I was interested in was conveying an emotional message, which means using everything you've got inside you sometimes to barely make a note or if you have to strain to sing, you sing.
Sometimes I sound like gravel and sometimes I sound like coffee and cream.
When I first saw Nina at my club in 1959, I was impressed.
She was different.
She mixed in folk music with jazz.
She played very fine piano.
Her voice was totally different from anybody else.
It was a woman's voice but it had the depth of a baritone.
That depth and that darkness carried the insight of what was in Nina's soul.
And it reached you very quickly.
She was an artist.
She was an original artist.
So we paid attention and in 1960,
I put her on the Newport Jazz Festival.
And she was a hit there.
Her sound is so original
When she first appeared, she was one of those musicians...
Once... you don't have to hear them much.
If you hear them once, the next time you hear them you say:
"Oh, that's that same one I heard last week.
Nobody sounds like that except her."
At Newport, she was sitting on a high stool with a tambourine.
I was in the back.
She wasn't sure she wanted to go through with it.
If I remember right, she was a little, you know...
"What am I doing here?"
I said: "You're here because you belong here."
She said: "OK, Al, but you'd better play."
I said: "Don't worry, I'll play."
Then, if you watch during her performance of "Little Liza", she has that little smile from time to time.
She let go and it was really cute.
Then I recorded seven or eight tunes
I had been doing all those years and of course the public picked out "I Loves You Porgy".
It was not pushed or promoted to be a hit at all.
- Girls!
Don!
Hi.
- Hi, Hugh, nice to see you.
Real great.
Eleanor, you wanna take Don's coat here?
Maybe you can show the girls where the powder room is, the bedroom.
Hello there.
Very nice to have you with us this evening.
This is Playboy's Penthouse, and I'm Hugh Hefner, editor publisher of Playboy Magazine.
I'd like you to meet someone most of you know, Nina Simone.
She came out of nowhere in the last year as a recording star.
She has a very big record, "Porgy"
that is breaking all kinds of sales records.
We're very happy she could join us
- tonight on Playboy's Penthouse
- Thanks.
She's gonna play and sing a little bit now with her group.
You want to hear "Porgy"?
- Very much.
- Right.
Good.
That's what we'll do.
Nina, there's a man named Andy Stroud.
He walked into your life and he became a permanent part.
How did you meet your husband?
He came to see me at a nightclub and a mutual friend introduced us.
Nina came to the table and sat.
I was eating a Hamburger plate and there were fries and she dipped into them.
She wanted to know if it was OK.
I said: "All right."
We got cute and then she gave me that card with a note on it.
Then I went to see her, at her place in the next day or two.
How did you know Andy Stroud was to be your husband and not just another guy out for a date or something else?
That's a hard question.
He told me that he'd wanted to meet me for a long time.
And he had come for me.
I fell in love with him.
Then later, he scared me to death, he was so...
You know, he knew what he wanted and he just took over
He abandoned his own career as a sergeant of the police department to manage me.
For the first time, I knew what it was not to be just floundering out there.
I just remember meeting Andy.
He was a tough New York vice squad cop.
When he stepped out of his car uptown, people ran.
He had a way of just saying one word.
"Hey."
And that could put a lot of fear in people.
But Andy and Nina married in 1961.
He retired from the police force and became her manager.
And he did well for her.
They bought a beautiful house in Mount Vernon, New York.
We had a 13-room house, four acres of land, a lot of trees.
Lisa was born nine months later.
The first three hours after Lisa was born were the most peaceful in my life.
And I was in love with the world.
Andrew was there.
He was sitting right there and he said:
I said, "How is the baby?" He says: "How is the mother?"
I loved him for that.
I loved being a mother.
I was a good mother.
I was a goddamn good mother.
I remember our house in Mount Vernon like the back of my hand.
It was like a fairy tale.
I remember seeing the paisley on the walls.
The walls were kind of like a..
They were hued in gold but it really wasn't gold.
It was more like a muted gold
But it felt like it was velvet.
I'd always run my hands over the walls because it was textured.
And my mom had a cold storage where she kept her fur coats and her costumes.
So I was always in there.
These were the good, sweet days.
We were building and growing together.
I had an overall plan to develop and create her as an artist.
I had set up an office at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street.
I had a publicist.
I had a guy who was a record promotion man from Atlantic Records.
I had another fellow who did the college radio station promotion and a photographer.
Dad was the original Puff Daddy.
He really had a vision and he was a very astute businessman.
And of course, she was burning to get on to the Carnegie Hall.
She had trained as a classical pianist with the one thought in mind of being the first black female classical pianist to appear at Carnegie Hall.
That was her prime objective.
However, none of the New York city promoters would undertake this project.
So, I took my own money to promote the appearance.
She was ecstatic.
I mean, she was out of her mind with joy.
You apparently wrote a letter to your parents saying:
"This is where you wanted me to play but I should have been playing Bach."
This was your glory occasion but you were still disappointed?
Well, I loved the audience, but I wasn't playing classical music and I wanted to be.
So I wrote: "Yes, I'm in Carnegie Hall, finally, but I'm not playing Bach."
After Carnegie Hall, she was getting airplay all over the country, magazine, pictures and stories.
She became highly successful and recognised.
- Oh!
Thank you very much!
- Meeting in Japan.
A young woman who's made a very emphatic name for herself...
An accomplished pianist and distinctive... who's now become a rather famous artist.
...a remarkable blues-soul sound.
For the first time on British television, the High Priestess of soul.
An exceptional singer.
- Nina Simone.
- Nina Simone.
Nina Simone.
Miss Simone brings to her music a kind of technique and discipline we generally associate with classical music.
She's introduced fugue and counterpoint into the freewheeling spontaneity of the jazz world.
Nina, do you think that now that you are successful as a popular artist that you'd like to do any classical?
Yes, but I don't have time to think about it too much.
But you have to realise that when I'm most satisfied with my music,
I call upon all the things that I've learned in classical music.
She wanted everything money and success could buy.
So I promised her that she was going to be a rich black bitch.
We had a blackboard and he used to put on there
"I'll be a rich black bitch"by this such and such date."
He said, "Then you could quit." I always believed him.
But I never could quit because he worked me too hard.
Andy said: "Nina, it's hard work.
"You want to make the money?
You have to work."
And she resented that.
Then, Lisa was born and she resented being torn away, having to go on the road.
I didn't realise what my mom did for a living.
I just know that Mom was always travelling.
My mother often told me that I had 13 nannies in seven years.
While she was trying to maintain some sense of schedule for me and normalcy for me, she was out there doing what she was doing.
Can I have five more minutes?
It's very frustrating...
When we were on the road, there were times we had to be careful.
She could get angry and start arguments with people.
You're all pushing, You're pushing.
Don't put nothin' in it.
Let's do it again.
If anyone were talking in the audience, she would just sit.
First she would say: "Please..."
She said: "I'm not continuing."
She'd get up, walk out and the gig was over.
I just want them to listen to the music like they did in the classical world.
I thought they needed teaching.
If they couldn't listen, fuck it!
She got into Carnegie Hall, and she got the big house in the country, but she began questioning herself.
She'd get into moods of depression about the whole business, the personal relationship, cursing, smashing things, and it worsened as the time went by.
All I did was work, work, work.
I was always tired.
I was always tired.
I could never sleep.
You see, music always goes through my head, which means the more I played the less I could relax.
I kept thinking Andy should let me rest.
He never did.
Got my liver
She felt she was handled like a racehorse and she was always fighting...
fighting, fighting it.
Andy would say:
"Nina, we've got a career here.
That's not gonna continue if you don't nurture it.
So, she came to resent Andy.
But she was afraid of Andy.
Andrew protected me against everybody but himself.
He wrapped himself around me like a snake.
I worked like a dog and I was scared of him.
And Andrew beat me up...
I've never talked to you about this, but he beat me up.
I was deathly scared of Andrew.
One time, early in the morning, like 4:00 or 5:00 o'clock, the phone rings, it's Nina, and she needed to hide out.
I had gone to a discotheque with Andrew.
A fan came up to me and gave me a note.
Andy saw me take this note and put it in my pocket.
She thought nothing of it.
She related this to me.
Andy came back and grabbed her arm and took her out from the place and beat her up.
When I got out on the street, he started raining blows on me, bloody blows.
He'd beat me all the way home, up the stairs, in the elevator, in my room, put a gun to my head.
Then he tied me up and raped me.
She came to my place and she was beat up.
And I put her to bed and she rested for a couple of days.
He didn't find me for two weeks
My eyes...
I couldn't see.
He said: "Who beat you up like that?"
I said: "You did." He said: "No, I didn't.
"I've been looking for you for two weeks."
I said: "You're insane."
He was brutal.
But I loved him.
I guess, I just believed he wouldn't do it any more.
My mother always said till the day she died,
Dad was the best manager that she ever had.
But on top of being charismatic he could be a bully, and he could be very mean.
And she was on the receiving end of that, more times than you know... she should have been, which should have been never.
Mom would allude to:
"He's rammed my head into a concrete wall."
She said that he punched her in the stomach when she was pregnant with me.
As a child I remember sitting in the car between them.
They were arguing about something and I remember my father reaching across me...
So I was like this... and backhanding her.
We're going home in the car, I'm driving and I slapped her.
Blood spurted right over this eyebrow.
She had, like, a one-inch cut from my ring.
We got her home and I clipped the skin together and taped it.
And a week later, there wasn't even a scar.
I think they were both nuts.
She stayed with him, she had this love affair with fire.
That's like inviting the bull with the red cape,
"Just come on into my kitchen and let's see what we can do."
That's what she did.
- What I want for her?
- Yes.
- Myself, what else?
- I mean career-wise.
My father had a strategic plan in terms of how Mom's career was gonna go.
He wanted her to be able to win all the awards and to become the huge star he knew that she could be.
But she wanted something more.
There was something missing, in her...
Some meaning.
They died in Birmingham, the nation's most segregated city.
Dynamite exploded on Sunday morning.
Killed four little girls, injured 20 other Negroes.
It was one of more than 40 bombings in that Birmingham area.
Kids were murdered in Birmingham!
On a Sunday and in Sunday schools, in a Christian nation!
And nobody cares!
When the kids got killed in that church...
That did it.
First you get depressed and after that, you get mad.
When these kids got bombed,
I just sat down and wrote this song.
And it's a very moving, violent song.
'Cause that's how I feel about the whole thing.
"Mississippi Goddam."
Phew!
Hmm?
Got my attention.
What she was doing was different.
There's something about a woman...
If you look at all the suffering that black folks went through...
Not one black man would dare say "Mississippi Goddam."
To have someone with her stature talking about your problem...
You know how happy they had to be?
We all wanted to say it.
She said it.
"Mississippi Goddam!"
For Mommy to write a song called "Mississippi Goddam"
was revolutionary.
They didn't have cursing on the radio or on television.
DJs refused to play it and boxes of the 45s used to be sent back from the radio stations cracked in two.
As the civil rights movement really swung into high gear, she swung into high gear with it.
In '65, we played at the Selma March in Montgomery, Alabama.
We have a legal and constitutional right to march from Selma to Montgomery.
It was extremely dangerous.
The federal Marshals were called in.
They were standing on the top of all the buildings downtown, with guns.
Seated in front of the stage facing the audience was Martin Luther King, Ralph Bunche from the UN and a lot of other worldwide dignitaries.
You had Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Sidney Poitier,
Bill Cosby, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Belafonte.
And we did "Mississippi Goddam".
My mother said that after she sang that song she got so angry that her voice broke.
And from "Mississippi Goddam" on, it never, ever returned to its former octave.
But I think that Mom's anger is what sustained her.
The energy, the creativity and the passion of those days is really what kept her going.
When she wrote "Mississippi Goddam",
I thought it was something else.
You know, I liked it.
They put a 45 out on it.
I knew it had a lot of impact.
But my complaint was that, while I was always pushing for the commercial side of the picture, she got sidetracked with all of these civil rights activities
When the civil rights thing came, all of a sudden,
I could let myself be heard about what I'd been feeling all the time.
When I was young, I knew to stay alive.
As a black family, we had to work at it.
We had to keep secrets.
We never complained about being poor, or being taken advantage of or not getting our share.
We had to keep our mouths shut.
As I walked across that railroad track every Saturday,
I knew to break the silence meant a confrontation with the white people of that town.
Although I didn't know I knew it, if the black man rises up and says:
"I am not gonna do that any more..."
he stands to get murdered.
But no one mentioned that, which is indeed quite strange.
It touched me the first time, when I gave the recital at this library.
Everybody was seated and they told me my parents had to sit in the back.
I said: "If they have to sit in the back, I won't perform."
They fixed it that time.
They brought them to the front and they let them sit down.
It was my first feeling of being discriminated against.
I recoil in horror at such a thing.
I choose to reflect the times and the situations in which I find myself.
That, to me, is my duty...
And at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when every day is a matter of survival,
I don't think you can help but be involved.
Young people, black and white know this.
That's why they are so involved in politics.
We will shape and mould this country, or it will not be moulded and shaped at all any more.
I don't think you have a choice...
How can you be an artist and not reflect the times?
Yeah!
I've always thought that I was shaking people up, but now I want to go at it more,
I want to go at it more deliberately.
And I want to go at it coldly.
I want to shake people up so bad that when they leave a nightclub where I've performed...
I just want them to be to pieces.
All right!
I wanna go in that den of those elegant people with their old ideas, smugness and just drive them insane.
Rise up!
It's all right if you dance slow!
It was exhilarating to be part of that movement at the time, because I was needed.
I could sing to help my people.
And that became the mainstay of my life.
Not classical piano, not classical music, not even popular music, but civil rights music.
I got to know Martin Luther King, Malcom X,
Andrew Young and artists, actors, actresses, poets, writers, people like myself who felt compelled to make the stand that I have.
It was very important for her to connect with the writers and playwrights of that moment because those people had the intellectual background of the movement.
She didn't have that.
She had the musical background.
For instance, Langston Hughes wrote the lyrics for "Backlash Blues" for her.
Lorraine Hansberry...
Nina took her play, "Young, Gifted and Black"
and made a song out of it.
It's regarded as one of the most important songs in the civil rights movement.
I know there are only 300 black students here in this college of 18,000.
So, this song is dedicated only to you.
Lorraine Hansberry was my best friend.
She wrote plays, "Raisin in The Sun"
and "Young, Gifted and Black".
She taught me a lot about Karl Marx, Lenin and philosophy.
The basic fabric of our society that has Negroes in the situation they are in is the thing, which must be changed.
Those times were pretty amazing.
I look back now and I'm like:
"Wow!
Who's Who of Black America."
Lorraine Hansberry was my godmother,
Malcom X's wife, Betty Shabazz, was my auntie.
They lived right next door in Mount Vernon.
There are six daughters and I was like the seventh.
I was always riding my bike over there.
Lisa and I were the same age
I think we may have called one another twins.
It was just a great time.
There was music, there were discussions.
Whether it was at our house or Lisa's house, Nina Simone's home, it was definitely party with a purpose.
We happened to be a fly on the wall with some of the genius poets and poetesses of the time, the era.
To sit in that room and listen...
These were brilliant well-read, well-travelled, charming, alluring, charismatic people who were moved to make a difference in the world.
I am born of the Young, Gifted and Black affirmation.
For me, and those of us in that environment, it was daring to proclaim it.
And then share it joyously.
When she sang it...
People would stand up and engage in their African-ness without apology.
It's like a contemporary, hip song of the era.
It means you get to hum it in public.
She became a legend in the activists' movement.
And through meetings and discussions I overheard, she was convinced that certain things must be done in order to
push the revolution.
I told her that's not the answer.
And it began to manifest in her attitude towards me and the business.
She'd fly off.
I remember a few nights, you'd go to bed happy and holding one another and wake up...
She'd be sitting up in bed with her arms folded looking at me, thinking about killing me.
And this is how it went.
The political work became very heavy.
To me we are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world, black people.
So, my job is to make them more curious about where they came from.
And their own identity and pride in that identity.
That's why I try to make my songs as powerful as possible, mostly to make them curious about themselves.
We don't know anything about ourselves.
We don't even have the pride and dignity of African people.
We can't even talk about where we came from.
We don't know.
It's like a lost race.
I really mean to provoke this feeling of "Who am I?" "Where do I come from?"
You know, "Do I really like me?
and "Why do I like me?"
Like, you know, "If I'm black and beautiful,
I really am and I know it,
I don't care who cares or says what."
This is what compels me to push black people to identify with black culture.
Giving out to them that blackness, that black power.
Nina was a real rebel.
She didn't really fit in the revolutionary black female role that was offered her.
She could avoid pretentious phoniness and get more depth out of her song than people are used to hearing out of those songs.
She was that kind of patron saint of the rebellion.
Nina started to get more aggressive.
I remember one time as she walked to Dr King and said:
"I'm not non-violent."
He said: "That's OK, sister.
You don't have to be."
I was never non-violent.
Never.
I thought we should get our rights by any means necessary.
And then she met Stokely Carmichael.
Miss Simone says something very significant in her song "Mississippi Goddam".
She says, "This country is built on lies."
You're gonna sit in front of your television set and listen to LBJ tell you that
"Violence never accomplishes anything, my fellow Americans."
And the honky drafting you out of school to go fight in Vietnam.
If you don't want any trouble, keep your filthy white hands off our beautiful black skin.
Keep them off!
I am just one of the people who's sick of the social order, sick of the establishment, sick to my soul of it all.
To me, America's society is nothing but a cancer, and it must be exposed before it can be cured.
I am not the doctor to cure it.
All I can do is expose the sickness.
Are you ready, black people?
Yeah!
Are you ready, black people?
Yeah!
Are you really ready?
Yeah!
She wanted to align herself with the extreme terrorist militants who were influencing her.
And after all of these meetings with all these people, she would come to me and,
"Let's get the guns.
Let's poison the reservoir."
All sorts of violent terrorist acts.
Are you ready to call the wrath of black gods, black magic, to do your bidding?
Black people are never gonna get their rights unless they have their own separate state.
And if we'd have armed revolution, there'd be a lot of blood.
I think we'd have that separate state.
Are you ready to smash white things?
Yeah!
To burn buildings, are you ready?
Yeah!
At a certain point, Nina started to play only political songs and nothing else.
That started to hurt her career.
That became a problem to book her, because promoters were a bit afraid it might only be the political message that you were getting.
Are you ready to kill if necessary?
Yeah!
- Is your mind ready?
- Yeah!
Is your body ready?
Yeah!
If I'd had my way, I'd have been a killer.
I would have had guns and I would have gone to the South and gave them violence for violence, shotgun for shotgun, but my husband told me...
I didn't know anything about guns and he refused to teach me.
The only thing I had was music, so I obeyed him.
If I'd had my way, I wouldn't be sitting here today.
I'd be probably dead.
Are you really, really, really ready?
Yeah!
She's putting down the white people...
You know, like a barking dog.
But she still wanted all the good things.
Whenever she'd see Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight and all of these people on the prime television shows, she, of course, was very upset because she wasn't able to get on to these shows because of her reputation.
It got so that there wasn't that much work and the expenses were high.
It was cutting the legs out from all the work that I had done.
See you later.
I'll see you later.
I remember my dad complaining about the fact she never stopped speaking out.
But that's who she was.
It was OK when you were on stage.
It's OK 'cause you let it all hang out and then when the show ends and the lights go out,
"OK, let's put the monkey back in the cage and eat your banana, you know, just behave yourself."
It was like she was penalised and punished for being herself.
That's a very painful, lonely place to be.
Good evening.
Tonight my guest in the studio with me needs almost no introduction.
She is Miss Nina Simone.
Nina, when it comes to the artists today, we find that more of the artists are attempting to alert America to the need for change.
Is this really the artist's role?
Well, I think it's something that I've chosen to do and I've felt compelled to do it.
So it is my role... but sometimes, I wish it wasn't.
I think that the artists who don't get involved in preaching messages probably are happier.
But you see, I have to live with Nina and that is very difficult.
I think 19 people depend on me for their livelihood.
That's a hell of a lot of people.
I know that if I say, "Look, I'm too tired to work tonight,
I'm gonna get it from both ends.
Nobody's gonna understand or care that I'm too tired.
I'm very aware of that.
Now, I would like some freedom, somewhere...
Where I didn't feel those pressures.
By the late '60s, I realised that Nina was fighting demons that could appear at any moment and you wouldn't know it.
She could get violent, she could get really physical, and the change in her would be dramatic...
Boom, like a switch.
After a while, I realised I wasn't with my sister...
I was with "that one".
And that one was menacing.
She was very concerned, in her sane moments, about these fits of depression and anger.
We even went to Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital,
I think we signed her in for four or five days.
They conducted every test known to medicine at the time.
They were unable to find anything.
And her downward spiral, it just got worse and worse.
We did a tour with Bill Cosby, and the last night, she became erratic.
She had a can of shoe polish.
She was putting it in her hair.
She began talking gibberish...
She was totally out of it, incoherent.
It appeared she was having a nervous breakdown.
When it came time to go on, I had to escort her by holding her arm onto the stage and sat her down at the piano.
I immediately stood in the wings on the opposite side where we could see one another.
She's watching me pantomime and she performed.
Basically, she had no control over her emotions, and underneath it all, sex dominated her.
There were times, once or twice a week, when there was a sex attack when she goes into a maniacal rage.
There had to be sex.
I mean, this is driving her.
My attitude towards sex was that we should have it all the time.
How did Andy act towards you?
I just wanted him to move me sexually, and he never was able to.
Right.
He didn't know how to touch me and he never had enough time.
He'd come to see me late at night and be there two hours and leave.
I knew that she was dating other people.
We agreed we could both have our own outside partners.
But we would work together for the sake of the business and the child.
I can't sit here and speak about
Aunt Nina and Uncle Andy's marriage.
What I can say is that participation and activism during the '60s rendered chaos in any individual's lives.
People sacrificed sanity, well-being, life.
Nina Simone was a free spirit in an era that didn't really appreciate a woman's genius.
So what does that do to a household and a family?
Not because of income, but because of your soul not being able to do what you need to do.
Direct from our newsroom in Washington, this is the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite.
Good evening.
Dr Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
Jesus!
There was shock in the nation's negro communities.
Men, women and children poured into the streets.
They appeared dazed.
Many were crying.
I think White America made its biggest mistake when she killed Dr King last night.
He was the one man in our race who was trying to teach our people to have love, compassion and mercy for what white people had done.
When White America killed Dr King last night, she killed all reasonable hope.
We wanted to do a tune written for today, for this hour, for Dr Martin Luther King.
We had yesterday to learn it and...
So we'll see.
Last year, Lorraine Hansberry left us.
She was a dear friend.
Then Langston Hughes left us.
Who can go on?
Do you realise how many we have lost?
Then it really gets down to reality, doesn't it?
Not a performance.
Not microphones and all that crap, but really something else.
We can't afford any more losses
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
They're shooting us down, one by one.
Don't forget that...
'Cause they are.
Killing us one by one.
I knew that we were lost.
I felt chased all the time, no matter what I did or how sad I got.
I felt that there was just no life for me in the country.
I knew I had to quit or I had to leave Andy or do something.
So I took my ring off, put it on the table and I left the country.
According to my godsister Attallah Shabazz...
I was staying with them, and Mom had gone away, and the phone would ring and whenever it would ring,
I would go running, saying, "Is that my mommy on the phone?"
Then I remember going back to the house in Mount Vernon and Dad just wasn't there.
He wasn't there.
And nobody told me anything, you know?
And...
So...
One day you're at home and the staff is there, your dad's there the dog's there and everything that's familiar to you is there.
And then you come back, I don't know, weeks later and...
Nothing's there, nobody's there.
I decided that I wanted to go to Africa to live and never come back to America.
I got divorced from Andy and I went to Liberia and I moved there to stay.
When I got to Africa, I am happy, I'm beyond happy.
Liberia is a place that was founded by the American slaves, and it only makes sense that I should feel at home there.
Bikinis and boots is all I wore.
Yeah.
There was no loneliness.
There was no boredom.
The days flew into nights, and you just couldn't keep up with the times 'cause there was so much to do.
It was always fun.
I also am keenly aware that I've entered a world that I dreamed of all my life and that it is a perfect world.
I remember thinking of the United States as something that I had had in a dream sometime in my life but is now gone, like it never existed!
It was a dream that I had had and I had worked myself out of it because I had toiled so long in that place, in that prison...
And now I'm home, now I'm free, and there is no going back.
There, it was vast and open, and everything was natural.
Everything.
I have seen lightning in Africa not flash, but hover, and what it does is it electrifies you into complete speechlessness.
I have seen it!
I have seen God.
In my seventh grade year, Mom moved me to Liberia, but she was always travelling and I never knew half the time if I wasn't going, that she was leaving or when she was coming back.
So, I lived with a family for a year and I went to school there.
And I lived with them, until Mom came and decided to buy a house on the beach.
I went from living with them to living with her.
And she just...
I could never do anything right.
She went from being my comfort to the monster in my life.
Now she was the person that was doing the beating, and she was beating me.
One time, we were in public somewhere,
I did something and she went off on me in front of everybody
I didn't show any emotion because when Mom would see you cry she knew she could push your buttons.
That's what she wanted.
And I would not give her that satisfaction.
When she would hit me, I would look her dead in her face.
She'd be like, "You better cry.
You better cry."
I wouldn't do it.
Times got really bad, to the point where I thought about committing suicide.
So, when I was 14, I flew to New York.
I wound up living with my dad and I never went back.
After we broke up, a lot of things happened.
She didn't file taxes.
She didn't take care of business.
She lost the house in Mount Vernon.
Everything went crazy.
She lived a nomadic life, having no manager, having no husband but she always said living in Africa was the happiest time in her life.
She could just be there, enjoy herself.
She didn't have to sing at all.
She wasn't playing piano and she wasn't performing.
She said she hated the piano.
She hated it.
Think about it.
She's playing since she was four years old.
On the other hand, she was well aware in Africa, no money came in.
So she had to pick up her career again.
She didn't want to return to what she called,
"The United Snakes of America."
So, she moved to Switzerland, which was the complete opposite of Africa.
The first thing she did was the Montreux concert.
You on, yeah?
Do you hear all those noises?
You didn't forget me, huh?
That's what's so wild, you didn't forget me.
I didn't expect you to.
But I'm tired.
You don't know what I mean.
And they are many people in show business who said:
"You know, she used to be a star.
She's gone all the way to the bottom"
and all kinds of crap, which means nothing to me at all.
I hope that you will see me or see the spirit in another sphere, on another plane very soon now.
And again, I don't wanna let you down and I get this feeling.
So I think the only way to tell you who I am these days, is to sing a song by Janis Ian.
Hey, girl, sit down.
Sit down!
Sit down!
In Switzerland, I had no money.
I never got anything from Andy.
He just cut himself off from me and I was left high and dry.
So, I left Switzerland and I went to Paris, thinking I could resume my career.
I did it alone.
And I landed in the wrong place
I was working every night in a small café, for about $300 a night.
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.
The show is over.
No, we just do " Vous Etes Seuls."
It goes like this.
I was desperate and no one believed I was there.
I was too big to be there.
No one came to see me.
I had fallen from grace.
I'm sorry that I didn't become the world's first black classic pianist.
I think I would have been happier.
I'm not very happy now.
I wouldn't change being part of the civil rights movement.
I wouldn't change that.
But some of the songs that I sang have hurt my career.
All of the controversial songs the industry decided to punish me for.
They put a boycott on all of my records, and it's... hard for me to incorporate those songs any more because they are not relevant to the times.
In terms of the civil rights movement, how far have we come?
There aren't any civil rights.
What do you mean?
There is no reason to sing those songs.
Nothing is happening.
There's no civil rights movement.
Everybody's gone.
I met Nina in 1967and I've been her friend all her life.
She called me in 1982 and she was here in Paris, living in a very small apartment, hardly with any money.
She did concerts of four hours long at Trois Mailletz, that nightclub, and she got a few hundred dollars a night.
That was the worst period.
I visited her in that little apartment and it was so dirty.
I cleaned it all up and...
"Nina, you can't live like this."
At that moment, she was still uncontrollable.
This thing in the Grand Hotel in Paris happened.
Somebody looked her in the eyes a bit too long,
She was already a bit nervous and she kind of... made a movement, and I thought, "She's gonna hit him."
Immediately, my arms around her and I dragged her out in a taxi.
I said to the taxi driver, "Drive."
When I saw her in Paris, she was like a street urchin, dressed in rags.
I couldn't believe what was happening and I was really sad.
Gerrit and I knew something was very wrong.
We were trying to figure out,
"What is it?
What is it, really?"
So Gerrit found her a condo in Nijmegen in Holland
Gerrit had a friend, a doctor, that he brought to Nina's place
The doctor examined her and asked her questions, and he prescribed a medication, new spectrum, called Trilafon.
It wasn't until I was in my 20s that I went to visit her in Nijmegen.
That's when I learned the term "manic-depressive"and "bipolar"
and I remember asking, "What is that?
What do you mean by that?"
And her mood swings and a lot of the things I dealt with earlier in life when one minute she'd be happy, the next minute...
I'd be dealing with someone that wasn't in the room five minutes ago.
It started to make sense.
She got so deep in the shit in the end that she realised it's either dying or give in.
And she gave in because we said, "Nina... we'll get you a house, we'll get you your musicians, we'll make the things all right around you, we'll book your concerts,
but you have to do what we say.
You have to take your medicine.
You have to work.
God has given you the possibility to be able to do what you do, so do it.
The only thing we want to hear is either 'yes' or 'no'."
She said, with tears in her eyes, "Yes."
When I saw her,
I was very concerned because she had a nervous tic.
She'd be talking or sitting and this...
Her mouth would always be twitching.
When she would walk, it was more of a shuffle.
And I'm like, "What's going on here?"
You know, "Why...
What's going on?
What am I missing?"
And they had her on medication.
She started taking the Trilafon and the doctor said,
"Through the years, it's going to have an effect on her motor skills.
Her voice is going to start to slur and her piano abilities will decline.
You can deal with that or you can deal with her probably damaging herself or someone else."
But the Trilafon really helped.
There were times in Holland, sitting on her terrace in these lounge chairs and just holding hands...
She was like...
She was my sister and not talking at all for hours, just enjoying the day.
I suppose that medication enabled her to perform and fulfil the business dealings that were taking place so that her career could get back on track.
But there were times when I questioned that.
"But what about her heart?"
Because at the end of the day, you guys got wives and husbands, and lives.
But she's alone.
My personal life is a shambles.
I've had a few love affairs and I would love to be married, but everything has had to be sacrificed for the music.
We had to do, first in Holland, eight concerts, and the word spread that Nina's doing the job well.
Then she was on the road again and it was... poof.
The business was going.
She came onstage and you had this overwhelming emotional feeling coming from the audience, just because she was there.
Now listen to me.
I love you very much.
I think you know that.
And I know that you love me.
I know that.
We never knew too well what was going to happen and how the mood would be.
So this place is very hot, it's very crowded and it's very ugly.
But she opened her heart and soul at that moment.
This is a special kind of connection she had with an audience.
This song is popular all over France.
It's from our first album, the very first album we made in this world, which is at least 25 years old.
I only wish I was as wise...
I could have been as wise then as I have become now.
I have suffered.
But there's a Bösendorfer here, so we'll see what happened.
"My Baby Just Cares For Me."
She was helped by "My Baby Just Cares For Me", that song that became a hit because of the Chanel ad.
When "My Baby Just Cares For Me" came along,
I said, "I have to take this opportunity now to go all over the world, because it's my last chance."
So, I worked very hard to take advantage of my second coming because it was my last time as far as I was concerned.
She was happiest doing music.
I think that was her salvation.
That's the one thing she didn't have to think about.
When she sat at the piano, her fingers could fly.
She was an anomaly, she was a genius, she was brilliant.
That brilliance shone through, no matter what she was going through.
Even into her old age, she was brilliant.
She was genius.
She could do whatever she liked.
And when she didn't have her medicine, she, musically, could get even further out.
In one of those little concerts, and it's recorded, she starts playing one song and she sings another.
At this recording, I made Miles Davis...
While we were on tour, we were on the same jazz tour as Miles Davis...
And I made him listen to it and he said,
"Let me listen to it again.
How is she doing this?"
He couldn't understand.
As I got older, I started to look at her and I thought to myself, "Wow, she's from another time."
But she was not at odds with the time.
Time was at odds with her.
I think when a person moves to their own kind of clock, spirit, flow, if we were living in an environment that allowed us to be exactly who we are, you're always in congress with yourself.
The challenge is,
"How do we fit in in the world that we're around?"
"Are we allowed to be exactly who we are?"
"Was Nina Simone allowed to be exactly who she was?"
As fragile as she was strong, as vulnerable as she was dynamic, she was African royalty.
How does royalty stomp around in the mud and still walk with grace?
Most people are afraid to be as honest as she lived.
Good night!
All right!
Whoo!
It's so hard!
Tremendous pleasure and honor to welcome the incredible, unique, and fantastic, one and only Nina Simone.
Hello.
Hi!
We're ready.
One, two, three.
I haven't seen you for many years, since 1968.
I have decided that I will do no more jazz festivals.
That decision has not changed.
I will sing for you, or we will do and share with you a few moments,
after which I shall graduate to a higher class, I hope, and I hope you will come with me.
We will start from the beginning, which was about a little girl,
and her name was Blue.
What's "free" to you, Nina?
-What's "free" to me?
-Yeah.
Same thing it is to you.
You tell me.
No, no, you tell me.
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.
It's just a feeling.
It's like, "How do you tell somebody how it feels to be in love?"
How are you going to tell anybody who has not been in love how it feels to be in love?
You cannot do it to save your life.
You can describe things but you can't tell them, but you know it when it happens.
That's what I mean by "free."
I've had a couple of times onstage when I really felt free, and that's something else.
That's really something else!
Like, all... all...
Like...
like--
I'll tell you what freedom is to me, no fear.
I mean, really, no fear.
If I could have that half of my life, no fear.
My mother was one of the greatest entertainers of all time, hands down... but she paid a huge price.
People seem to think that when she went out on stage, that was when she became Nina Simone.
My mother was Nina Simone 24/7... and that's where it became a problem.
When she was performing, she was brilliant, she was loved.
She was also a revolutionary.
She found a purpose for the stage, a place from which she could use her voice to speak out for her people.
But when the show ended, everybody else went home.
She was alone and she was still fighting... but she was fighting her own demons... full of anger and rage.
She couldn't live with herself... and everything fell apart.
Good evening.
Our guest tonight is Nina Simone.
Probably the foremost blues singer, jazz singer, singer of all songs in the United States today.
Nina, are you happy with the kind of work you are doing?
What makes me the happiest, is when I'm performing and there are people out there who feel with me and I know I touched them.
But to be completely honest, the whole thing seems so much like a dream.
I never thought I was gonna stay in show business.
When I first got into show business,
I wasn't a blues singer and I wasn't even a jazz singer.
I was a classical pianist.
I studied to become the first black classical pianist in America, and that's all that was on my mind.
That's what I was prepared to be.
I was born Eunice Waymon, which is my real name, by the way, in a town called Tryon, North Carolina.
I started to play the piano when I was three or four.
My mother was a preacher and she took me with her on her revivals, and I started to play the piano in church.
Revival meetings were some of the most exciting times that I've ever had.
The music was so intense, you just sort of went out of yourself.
I felt it tremendously.
I was leading it.
When I was seven, the choir of our church gave a program at the local theater, and I was on that program...
And I played some song, I don't remember what it was, and these two women, two white women, in the audience heard me.
One of them was the woman that my mother worked for, and the other one was a music teacher, Mrs. Mazzanovich, and they decided right then and there to give me lessons.
And so, for five years after that,
I studied piano, classical piano, with this teacher.
I crossed the railroad tracks every weekend to get to Mrs. Mazzanovich.
And, you know, railroad tracks in the South are supposed to be dividing the blacks from the whites.
Well, it really did.
I was so scared.
Mrs. Mazzanovich frightened me.
It was her being white, in the sense that I had never seen.
She was alien to me.
Her white hair, the combs in it, her pleasantness...
I loved that.
And she started me on Bach.
And this Bach, I liked him.
Mrs. Mazzanovich had it in her mind that I was gonna be one of the world's greatest concert pianists.
So it was all very disciplined classical music.
Bach, Beethoven, Debussy, Brahms, you name it.
Then Mrs. Mazzanovich got a fund together, "Eunice Waymon Fund,"
and I gave lots of recitals, and they would take up collection to further my education after I had left her.
Mommy took to all of the training like a fish to water, but it was a double-edged sword.
She had a very lonely life because she was practicing seven, eight hours a day.
When I first started to take lessons,
I became terribly aware of how isolated I was from the other children, and how isolated I was from the white community and the negro community.
I felt it, all the time, even when the kids used to play with me.
They always wanted me just to play the piano for them to dance.
I wasn't asked too much to do anything else.
That was very hard.
Part of that isolation, of course, was the thing about color.
I was a black girl, and I knew about it, and I lived in it.
I lived in the South for 17 years.
My mom rarely referred to Jim Crow and segregation and a lot of the racial issues that were going on at that stage in her life.
But she did tell me about times when she was told her nose was too big, her lips were too full and her skin was too dark.
And after she was told that, they probably told her,
"There's only certain things you'll be good for in your life."
What I knew, I knew.
But we weren't allowed to mention anything racial in our house.
I wasn't consciously dealing with race.
That wasn't consciously on my mind at all... until years later.
After I graduated from high school, the money that had been saved from the Eunice Waymon Fund sent me to New York to Juilliard for a year and a half.
And then I applied for a scholarship to Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
I was playing Czerny and Liszt and Rachmaninoff and Bach.
I knew I was good enough, but they turned me down, and it took me about six months to realize it was because I was black.
I never really got over that jolt of racism at the time.
Then the money ran out and the reality hit me that I had to go to work.
My parents had moved the whole family to Philadelphia to be near me, and my family is very poor, so I had to work.
What else was there for me to do?
So, I got myself a job in Atlantic City for a summer.
It was a very crummy bar and I used to go in in evening gowns.
I didn't know any better.
And I played everything that I could think of.
Pop songs, classical, spirituals, all kinds of things.
It was very strange.
And I had never sung before, and the owner came in the second night and told me if I wanted to keep the job, I had to sing.
So, $90 was more money than I had ever heard of in my life, so I said, "Well, I'll sing," and ever since then, I've been singing.
Eunice Waymon was playing in the bars to support her family and to have money to continue her classical piano training.
But since she didn't want her mother to know that she was playing "the devil's music" in bars, she changed her name.
Eunice Waymon became Nina Simone.
She named herself "Niña," meaning "little one,"
and she had a boyfriend who called her "Niña,"
and "Simone" came from the French actress Simone Signoret.
I didn't want my mother to find out.
I knew she would hate it.
So I, kind of, kept it from her for a long, long time.
Was it lonely for a young girl entertaining in these strange bars?
Extremely.
Extremely lonely.
Working peculiar hours, I imagine.
12:00 midnight to 7:00 in the morning.
It ruined your social life, uh...
Never had much of one.
- Why'd you keep on with it?
- Couldn't help it.
I have to play and I needed money.
It was always a matter of necessity from day to day what I'm going to do.
I didn't even know I was going to stay in show business.
I never thought about a choice.
From the beginning, I felt there was something eating at her.
You know, "What's eating at you, Nina?"
And, um... gradually that got stronger.
The first time I played with Nina, it was the summer of 1957 at a restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania.
She didn't look at me.
Said nothing, as though I wasn't...
I wasn't even there, and started in on a song.
She never told me what key she was going to be in.
She just started playing, and I knew exactly where I was going to go with it.
It was like we had a telepathic relationship.
Before you knew it, we were just weaving in and out.
And then she looked up.
Al Schackman is a terribly sensitive, creative man.
He has perfect pitch, which means that no matter what key I'm in, he's able to adapt himself immediately, 'cause I do that all the time.
I'll change the key in the middle of a tune.
Nina had a wonderful way of taking a piece of music, and... not interpreting it, but...
but, like, metamorphosizing it.
You know, morphing it into her experience.
What I was interested in was conveying an emotional message, which means using everything you've got inside you sometimes to barely make a note or if you have to strain to sing, you sing.
So sometimes I sound like gravel, and sometimes I sound like coffee and cream.
When I first saw Nina at my club in 1959,
I was impressed.
She was different.
She mixed in folk music with jazz.
She played very fine piano.
Her voice was totally different from anybody else.
It was a woman's voice, but it had the depth of a baritone.
That depth and that darkness carried the insight of what was in Nina's soul... and it reached you very quickly.
She was an artist.
She was an original artist.
So we paid attention, and in 1960, I put her on the Newport Jazz Festival, and she was a hit there.
Her sound is so original.
When she first appeared... she was one of those musicians who...
Once-
- You don't have to hear them a bunch.
If you hear them once, then the next time you hear 'em, you say,
"Oh, that's that same one I heard last week.
Nobody sounds like that except her."
At Newport, she was sitting on a high stool with a tambourine, and I was in the back.
She wasn't sure she wanted to go through with it.
If I remember right, she was a little, you know, "What am I doing here?"
And I said, "You're here because, you know, you belong here."
And she said, "Okay, Al, but you better play."
And I said, "Don't worry, I'll play."
But then, if you watch during her performance of "Little Liza,"
she has that little smile from time to time.
She let go, and it was really cute.
Then I recorded seven or eight tunes that I had been doing all of those years, and of course, the public picked out "I Loves You Porgy."
It was not pushed or promoted to be a hit at all.
-Girls!
Guys!
Hi.
-Hi, Hugh, nice to see you.
Real good.
Eleanor, you want to, uh, take Don's coat here, and maybe you can show the girls where the powder room is and bedroom.
Hello, there.
Very nice to have you with us this evening.
This is Playboy's Penthouse, and I'm Hugh Hefner, editor/publisher of Playboy magazine.
I'd like you to meet someone that I think most of you know, Nina Simone.
She came out of nowhere in the last year as a recording star.
Now has a very, very big record in "Porgy"
that is breaking all kinds of sales records.
We're very happy she could join us
-tonight on Playboy's Penthouse...
-Thanks.
...and she's going to play and sing a little bit for us now with her group.
Do you want to hear "Porgy"?
- Very much!
- Right!
Good, that's what we'll do.
Nina, there's a man named Andy Stroud.
He walked into your life and became a permanent part.
How did you meet your husband?
He came to see me at a nightclub and a mutual friend introduced us.
Nina came to the table and sat, and I was eating a hamburger plate, and there were fries, and she dipped into them.
And she wanted to know if it was okay.
I said, "All right."
We got cute and then she gave me that card with a note on it.
Then I went over to see her at her place in the next day or two.
How did you know that Andy Stroud was to be your husband and not just another guy out for a date or something else?
That's a hard question.
He told me that he had wanted to meet me for a long time.
And he had come for me.
I fell in love with him.
Then later, he scared me to death.
He was so, you know...
He knew what he wanted and he just took over.
He abandoned his own career as a sergeant of the police department to manage me, and for the first time, I knew what it was not to be just floundering out there.
I just remember meeting Andy.
Here was a tough, New York, you know, vice squad cop, that when he stepped out of his car uptown, people ran.
And he had... he had a way of just saying one word...
"Hey."
...and that could put a lot of fear in people.
But Andy and Nina married in 1961.
He retired from the police force and became her manager, and he did well for her.
They bought a beautiful house in Mount Vernon, New York.
We had a 13-room house, four acres of land, lot of trees.
And Lisa was born nine months later.
The first three hours after Lisa was born were the most peaceful in my life, and I was in love with the world.
And Andrew was there.
He was sitting right there, and he said--
I said, "How's the baby?" He says, "How's the mother?"
And I loved him for that.
I loved being a mother.
I was a good mother.
I was a goddamn good mother.
I remember our house in Mount Vernon like the back of my hand.
It was like a fairy tale.
I remember seeing the paisley on the walls.
The walls were kind of like a...
They were hued in gold, but it really wasn't gold.
It was more like a muted gold but it felt like it was velvet.
So I'd always run my hands, like, over the walls, because it was textured.
And my mom, she had her cold storage where she kept her fur coats and her costumes.
So I was always in there.
These were the good, sweet days.
We were building and growing together.
I had an overall plan to develop and create her as an artist.
I had set up an office at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street.
I had a publicist.
I had a guy who was a record-promotion man that I got from Atlantic Records.
I had another fellow who did the college radio station promotion, and a photographer.
Dad was the original Puff Daddy.
I mean, he really had a vision, and he was a very astute businessman.
And of course, she was burning to get on to Carnegie Hall.
She had trained as a classical pianist with the one thought in mind of being the first black female classical pianist to appear in Carnegie Hall.
That was her prime objective.
However, none of the New York City promoters would undertake this project.
So, I took my own money to promote the appearance.
She was ecstatic.
I mean, she was out of her mind with joy.
You apparently wrote a letter to your parents saying,
"This is where you wanted me to play,
- but I should have been playing Bach." - "Playing Bach."
So this was your glory occasion, but you were still disappointed?
Well, I loved the audience, but I wasn't playing classical music, and I wanted to be, and so I wrote,
"Yes, I'm in Carnegie Hall, finally, but I'm not playing Bach."
After Carnegie Hall, she was getting airplay all over the country, magazine pictures and stories.
She became highly successful and recognized.
- Oh!
Thank you very much!
- Meeting in Japan.
A young woman who's made a very emphatic name for herself...
An accomplished pianist and distinctive who's now become a rather famous artist.
A remarkable blues-soul sound.
For the first time on British television,
The High Priestess of Soul...
-Nina Simone.
-Nina Simone.
The great Nina Simone.
Miss Simone brings to her music a kind of technique and discipline we generally associate with classical music.
She has introduced fugue and counterpoint into the freewheeling spontaneity of the jazz world.
Nina, do you think that now that you are successful as a popular artist that you'd like to do any classical?
Yes, but I don't have time to think about it too much.
But you have to realize that when I'm most satisfied with my music,
I call upon all of the things that I have learned in classical music.
She wanted everything that money and success could buy.
So I promised her that she was going to be a rich black bitch.
We had a blackboard and he used to put on there,
"I'll be a rich black bitch by this such-and-such date,"
and he said, "Then you could quit," and I always believed him, but I never could quit because he worked me too hard.
Andy said, "Nina, it's hard work.
You wanna make the money, you have to work."
And she resented that.
Then Lisa was born, and she resented being torn away, having to go on the road.
I didn't realize what my mom did for a living.
I just know that Mom was always traveling.
My mother often told me that I had 13 nannies in seven years.
So, while she was trying to maintain some sense of a schedule for me and normalcy for me, she was out there doing what she was doing.
Can I have five more minutes?
It's very frustrating...
When we were on the road, there were times we had to be careful.
She could get angry and start arguments with people.
Y'all pushing!
You're pushing!
Don't put nothin' in it!
Let's do it again.
If anyone were talking in the audience, she would just sit, and at first, she would say, "Please..."
and she said, "I'm not continuing."
She'd get up, walk out, and the gig was over.
I just want them to listen to the music like they did in the classical world.
I thought they needed teaching.
If they couldn't listen, fuck it!
She got into Carnegie Hall, and she got the big house in the country, but she began questioning herself.
She'd get into moods of depression about the whole business, the personal relationship, cursing and smashing things, and this worsened as the time went by.
All I did was work, work, work.
I was always tired.
I was always tired.
I could never sleep.
You see, music always goes through my head, which means the more I played, the less I could relax.
I kept thinking Andy would let me rest.
He never did.
She felt she was being handled like a racehorse, and she was always fighting, fighting, fighting it.
Andy would say, "Nina, we've got a career here.
That's not going to continue if you don't nurture it."
So, she came to resent Andy... but she was afraid of Andy.
Andrew protected me against everybody but himself.
He wrapped himself around me like a snake.
I worked like a dog, and I was scared of him... and Andrew beat me up.
But I've never talked to you about this.
But he beat me up.
I was deathly scared of Andrew.
One time, early in the morning, like 4:00, 5:00 in the morning, uh... the phone rings.
It's Nina, and she needed to hide out.
I had gone to a discotheque with Andrew... and a fan came up to me and gave me a note, and he saw me take this note and put it in my pocket.
She thought nothing of it.
I mean, she related this to me.
And Andy came back and grabbed her arm and took her out from the place and beat her up.
And when I got out on the street, he started raining blows on me.
Bloody blows.
He beat me all the way home, up the stairs, in the elevator, in my room, put a gun to my head.
Then he tied me up and raped me.
She came to my place and...
and she was beat up.
And I, you know, put her to bed, and... and she, you know, rested for a couple of days.
He didn't find me for two weeks.
My eyes, I couldn't see.
And he said, "Who beat you up like that?"
And I said, "You did!"
He said, "No, I didn't.
I've been looking for you for two weeks."
I said, "You're insane!"
He was brutal...
but I...
I loved him and I guess I just believed he wouldn't do it anymore.
My mother always said, till the day she died,
Dad was the best manager that she ever had.
But on top of being charismatic, he could be a bully and he could be very mean, and she was on the receiving end of that... more times than, you know, she should have been,
which should have been never.
Mom would allude to, you know,
"He's rammed my head into a concrete wall."
She said that he punched her in the stomach when she was pregnant with me.
As a child, I remember sitting in the car between them and they were arguing about something, and I remember my father reaching across me, so it was like this, and backhanding her.
We're going home in the car, I'm driving, and I slapped her.
Blood spurted...
right over this eyebrow.
She had, like, a one-inch cut from my ring, you know.
We got her home and I clipped the skin together and taped it... and a week later, there wasn't even a scar.
I think they were both nuts.
She stayed with him.
She had this love affair with fire.
That's like inviting the bull with the red cape,
"Just come on into my kitchen and let's see what we can do."
That's what she did.
- What do I want for her?
- Yes.
Myself.
What else?
Career-wise.
My father had a strategic plan in terms of how Mom's career was going to go.
He wanted her to be able to win all the awards, and to become the huge star that he knew that she could be... but she wanted something more.
There was something missing in her, some meaning.
They died in Birmingham, the nation's most segregated big city.
Dynamite exploded on Sunday morning, killed four little girls, injured 20 other negroes.
It was one of more than 40 bombings in that Birmingham area.
Kids were murdered in Birmingham on a Sunday and in Sunday schools in a Christian nation, and nobody cares!
When the kids got killed in that church... that did it.
First you get depressed, and after that, you get mad.
And when these kids got bombed,
I just sat down and wrote this song.
And it's a very...
moving, violent song, 'cause that's how I feel about the whole thing.
"Mississippi Goddam."
Phew!
Hmm?
Got my attention.
What she was doing was different.
There's something about a woman... if you look at all the suffering that black folks went through... not one black man would dare say, "Mississippi, goddam."
And then to have someone with her stature talking about your problem, you know how happy they had to be?
We all wanted to say it.
She said it.
"Mississippi, goddam!"
For Mommy to write a song called "Mississippi Goddam"
was revolutionary.
They didn't have cursing on the radio or on television or anything.
DJs refused to play it, and boxes of the 45s used to be sent back from the radio stations cracked in two.
As the civil rights movement really swung into high gear, she swung into high gear with it.
In '65, we played at the Selma March in Montgomery, Alabama.
We have a legal and constitutional right to march from Selma to Montgomery!
It was extremely dangerous.
The federal Marshals were called in, and they were standing on the tops of all the buildings downtown with guns.
Seated in front of the stage facing the audience was Martin Luther King,
Ralph Bunche from the UN and a lot of other worldwide dignitaries.
You had Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Sidney Poitier,
Bill Cosby, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Belafonte, and we did "Mississippi Goddam."
My mother said that after she sang that song, she got so angry that her voice broke... and from "Mississippi Goddam" on, it never, ever returned to its former octave.
But I think that Mom's anger is what sustained her.
The energy and the creativity and the passion of those days is really what kept her going.
When she wrote "Mississippi Goddam,"
I thought it was something else.
You know, I liked it.
They put a 45 out on it, and I knew it had a lot of impact.
But my complaint was that while I was always pushing for the commercial side of the picture, she got sidetracked with all of these civil rights activities.
When the civil rights thing came up, all of a sudden,
I could let myself be heard about what I'd been feeling all the time.
When I was young, I knew to stay alive.
As a black family, we had to work at it.
We had to keep secrets.
We never complained about being poor, or being taken advantage of or not getting our share.
We had to keep our mouths shut as I walked across that railroad track every Saturday.
So I knew to break the silence meant a confrontation with the white people of that town.
And though I didn't know I knew it, if the black man rises up and says, "I'm just not gonna do that anymore..."
...he stands to get murdered.
But no one mentioned that, which is, indeed, quite strange.
It touched me first time when I gave a recital at this library.
Everybody was seated and they told me my parents had to sit in the back, and I said,
"If they have to sit in the back, I won't perform."
They fixed it that time and they brought them to the front and they let them sit down, but it was my first feeling of being discriminated against, and I recoiled in horror at such a thing.
I choose to reflect the times and the situations in which I find myself.
That, to me, is my duty... and at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when every day is a matter of survival,
I don't think you can help but be involved.
Young people, black and white, know this, and so that's why they're so involved in politics.
We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore.
So I don't think you have a choice--
How can you be an artist and not reflect the times?
I've always thought that I was shaking people up, but now I want to go at it more and I want to go at it more deliberately and I want to go at it coldly.
I want...
I want to shake people up so bad that when they leave a nightclub where I've performed,
I just want them to be to pieces.
All right!
I want to go in that den of those elegant people with their old ideas, smugness, and just drive them insane.
Rise up!
It's all right if you dance slow!
But it was very exhilarating to be part of that movement at the time because I was needed.
Now I could sing to help my people, and that became the mainstay of my life.
Not classical piano, not classical music, not even popular music, but civil rights music.
I got to know Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Andrew Young, and artists, actors, actresses, poets, writers, people like myself who felt compelled to make the stand that I have.
It was very important for her to connect with the writers and playwrights of that moment because those people had the intellectual background of the movement and she didn't have that.
She had music, the musical background.
For instance, Langston Hughes, he wrote the lyrics for "Backlash Blues" for her.
Lorraine Hansberry, Nina took her play, Young, Gifted, and Black, and made a song out of it.
It's regarded as one of the most important songs in the civil rights movement.
I know that there are only 300 black students here in this college of 18,000.
So this song is dedicated only to you.
Lorraine Hansberry was my best friend, and she wrote plays, Raisin in the Sun and Young, Gifted, and Black.
She taught me a lot about Karl Marx, Lenin, philosophy.
The basic fabric of our society that has negroes in the situation that they are in is the thing which must be changed, you know.
Those times were pretty amazing.
I look back now and I'm just like, "Wow!
Who's who of Black America!"
Lorraine Hansberry was my godmother.
Malcolm X's wife, Betty Shabazz, was my auntie.
They lived right next door in Mount Vernon.
There are six daughters and I was like the seventh.
So I was always riding my bike over there.
Lisa and I were the same age, and...
I think we may have called one another twins.
It was just a great, great time.
There was music, there were discussions.
Whether it was at our house or Lisa's house, Nina Simone's home, it was definitely party with a purpose.
We happened to be a fly on the wall with some of the genius poets and poetesses of the time, the era.
And to sit in that room and listen...
These were brilliant, well-read, well-traveled, charming, alluring, charismatic people who were moved to make a difference in the world.
I'm born of the Young, Gifted, and Black affirmation.
For me, and those of us in that environment, it was daring to proclaim it... and then share it joyously when she sang it.
People would stand up and engage in their African-ness without apology... and it's a contemporary, hip song of the era.
It means you get to hum it in public.
She became a legend in the activists' movement, and through meetings and discussions that I overheard, she was convinced that certain things must be done in order to...
push the revolution.
I told them that's not the answer, and then it began to manifest in her attitude towards me and the business.
She'd fly off.
I remember a few nights, you know, you go to bed happy and holding one another.
I wake up, and she'd be sitting up in bed with her arms folded, looking at me, thinking about killing me.
And this is how it went.
The political work became very heavy.
To me, we are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world, black people.
So my job is to make them more curious about where they came from and their own identity and pride in that identity.
That's why my songs...
I try to make them as powerful as possible, mostly just to make them curious about themselves.
We don't know anything about ourselves.
We don't even have the pride and the dignity of African people, but we can't even talk about where we came from.
We don't know.
It's like a lost race.
I really mean to provoke this feeling of, like, "Who am I?
Where'd I come from?"
You know, "Do I really like me?" and, "Why do I like me?"
And, like, you know, "If I am black and beautiful,
I really am and I know it, and I don't care who cares or says what."
This is what compels me to push black people to identify with black culture.
Giving out to them that black-ness, that black power.
Nina was a real rebel.
She didn't really fit in the revolutionary black female role that was offered her.
She could avoid pretentious phoniness and get more depth out of a song than people are used to hearing out of those songs.
She was a kind of patron saint of the rebellion.
Nina started to get more aggressive.
I remember one time as she walked right up to Dr. King and said,
"I'm not non-violent!"
And he said, "That's okay, sister.
You don't have to be."
I was never non-violent.
Never.
I thought we should get our rights by any means necessary.
And then she met Stokely Carmichael.
Miss Simone says something very significant in her song "Mississippi Goddam."
She says, "This country..." She says, "This country is built on lies."
You're gonna sit in front of your television set and listen to LBJ tell you that,
"Violence never accomplishes anything, my fellow Americans."
And the honky drafting you out of school to go fight in Vietnam.
If you don't want any trouble, keep your filthy white hands off our beautiful black skin.
Keep them off!
I am just one of the people who is sick of the social order, sick of the establishment, sick to my soul of it all.
To me, America's society is nothing but a cancer, and it must be exposed before it can be cured.
I am not the doctor to cure it.
All I can do is expose the sickness.
Are you ready, black people?
Yeah!
Are you ready, black people?
Yeah!
- Are you really ready?
- Yeah!
She wanted to align herself with the extreme terrorist militants who were influencing her.
And after all of these meetings with all these people, she would come to me and,
"Let's get the guns.
Let's poison the reservoir."
All sorts of violent terrorist acts.
Are you ready to call the wrath of black gods... black magic...
Yeah!
...to do your bidding?
Black people are never going to get their rights unless they have their own separate state.
And if we'd have armed revolution, there'd be a lot of blood.
I think we'd have that separate state.
Are you ready to smash white things?
Yeah!
To burn buildings, are you ready?
Yeah!
At a certain point, Nina started to play only political songs and nothing else, and that started to hurt her career.
That became a problem to book her, because promoters were a little bit afraid that it might only be the political message that you were getting.
Are you ready to kill if necessary?
Yeah!
Is your mind ready?
Yeah!
- Is your body ready?
- Yeah!
If I'd had my way, I'd have been a killer.
I would have had guns, and I would have gone to the South and gave them violence for violence, shotgun for shotgun, but my husband told me...
I didn't know anything about guns, and he refused to teach me, and the only thing I had was music, so I obeyed him.
But if I'd had my way, I wouldn't be sitting here today.
I'd be probably dead.
Are you really, really, really ready?
Yeah!
She's putting down the white people...
I mean, you know, like a barking dog, but she still wanted all the good things.
Whenever she'd see, like, Aretha Franklin and Gladys Knight and all of these people on the prime television shows, she, of course, was very upset because she wasn't able to get on to these shows because of her reputation.
It got so that there wasn't that much work and the expenses were high.
It was cutting the legs out from all the work that I had done.
See you later.
I'll see you later.
I remember my dad complaining about the fact that she never stopped speaking out, but that's who she was.
It was okay when you were onstage.
It's okay 'cause you let it all hang out, and then when the show ends and the lights go out,
"Okay, let's put the monkey back in the cage, and eat your banana and, you know, just behave yourself."
It was like she was penalized and punished for being herself.
That's a very painful, lonely place to be.
Good evening.
Tonight my guest in the studio with me needs almost no introduction.
She is Miss Nina Simone.
Nina, when it comes to the artists today, we find that more of the artists are attempting to alert America to the need for change.
Is this really the artist's role?
Well, I think it's something that, um, I have chosen to do and I have felt compelled to do it.
So it is my role... but sometimes, I wish it wasn't.
I think that the artists who don't get involved in preaching messages probably are happier, but you see, I have to live with Nina, and that is very difficult.
I think 19 people depend on me for their livelihood.
That's a hell of a lot of people.
I know that if I say, "Well, look, I'm too tired to work tonight,"
I'm gonna get it from both ends.
Nobody's going to understand or care that I'm too tired.
I'm very aware of that.
Now, I would like some freedom, somewhere... where I didn't feel those pressures.
By the late '60s, I realized that Nina was fighting demons that could appear at any moment and you wouldn't know it.
She could get violent, she could get really physical, and the change in her would be dramatic... boom, like a switch.
And I...
I, after a while, realized that I was...
I wasn't with my sister, I was with "that one..."
and that one was... menacing.
She was very concerned, in her sane moments, about these fits of depression and anger.
We even went to Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital,
I think, signed her in for four or five days.
They conducted every test known to... medicine at the time and they were unable to find anything.
And her downward spiral, it just got worse and worse.
We did a tour with Bill Cosby, and the last night, she became erratic.
She had a can of shoe polish.
She was putting it in her hair.
And she began talking gibberish, and she was totally out of it, incoherent.
It appeared she was having a nervous breakdown.
And when it came time to go on,
I had to escort her by holding her arm onto the stage and sat her down at the piano, and I immediately stood in the wings on the opposite side where we could see one another.
She's watching me pantomime and she performed.
Basically, she had no control over her emotions, and underneath it all, sex dominated her.
There were times, once or twice a week, when there was a sex attack when she goes into a maniacal rage.
There had to be sex.
I mean, this is driving her.
My attitude towards sex was that we should have it all the time.
How did Andy act towards you?
I just wanted him to move me sexually, and he never was able to.
Right.
He didn't know how to touch me and he never had enough time.
He'd come to see me late at night and be there two hours and leave.
I knew that she was dating other people.
We agreed that we could both have our own outside partners... but we would work together for the sake of the business and the child.
I can't sit here and speak about Aunt Nina and Uncle Andy's marriage.
What I can say is that participation and activism during the '60s... rendered chaos in any individual's lives.
People sacrificed sanity, well-being, life.
Nina Simone was a free spirit in an era that didn't really appreciate a woman's genius.
So what does that do to a household and a family?
Not because of income, but because of your soul not being able to do what you need to do.
Direct from our newsroom in Washington, this is the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite.
Good evening.
Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
Jesus!
Jesus.
There was shock in the nation's negro communities.
Men, women and children poured into the streets.
They appeared dazed.
Many were crying.
I think White America made its biggest mistake when she killed Dr. King last night.
He was the one man in our race who was trying to teach our people to have love, compassion, and mercy for what white people had done.
When White America killed Dr. King last night, she killed all reasonable hope.
We want to do a tune written... for today... for this hour for Dr. Martin Luther King.
We had yesterday to learn it, and... so we'll see.
Last year, Lorraine Hansberry left us, and she was a dear friend, and then Langston Hughes left us.
Who can go on?
Do you realize how many we have lost?
Then it really gets down to reality, doesn't it?
Not a performance.
Not microphones and all that crap, but really something else.
We can't afford any more losses.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
They're shooting us down, one by one.
Don't forget that... 'cause they are... killing us one by one.
I knew that we were lost.
I felt chased all the time, no matter what I did or how sad I got.
I felt that there was just no life for me in the country.
I knew I had to quit or I had to leave Andy or do something.
So I took my ring off, put it on the table... and I left the country.
According to my godsister Attallah Shabazz...
I was staying with them, and Mom had gone away, and the phone would ring and whenever it would ring,
I would go running, saying, "Is that my mommy on the phone?"
And then I remember going back to the house in Mount Vernon and Dad just wasn't there.
He wasn't there.
And nobody told me anything, you know?
And, um, so...
One day you're at home and the staff is there and your dad's there and the dog's there and everything that's familiar to you is there, and then you come back, I don't know, weeks later
and... nothing's there, nobody's there.
I decided that I wanted to go to Africa to live and never come back to America.
I got a divorce from Andy and I went to Liberia... and I moved there to stay.
When I got to Africa, I am happy, I'm beyond happy.
Liberia is a place that was founded by the American slaves, and it only makes sense that I should feel at home there.
I wore...
Bikinis and boots is all I wore.
Yeah.
Well, there was no loneliness.
There was no boredom.
The days flew into nights, and you just couldn't keep up with the times 'cause there was so much to do.
It was always fun.
I also am keenly aware that I've entered a world that I dreamed of all my life and that it is a perfect world.
And I remember thinking of the United States as something that I had had in a dream sometime in my life, but is now gone, like it never existed!
It was a dream that I had had and I had worked myself out of it 'cause I had toiled so long in that place, in that prison... and now I'm home, now I'm free,
and there is no going back.
There, it was vast and open, and everything was natural.
Everything!
I have seen lightning in Africa not flash, but hover, and what it does is it electrifies you into complete speechlessness.
I have seen it!
I have seen God.
In my seventh grade year, Mom moved me to Liberia, but she was always traveling, and I never knew half the time if I wasn't going, that she was leaving or when she was coming back.
So I lived with a family for a year and I went to school there, and I lived with them until Mom came and decided to buy a house on the beach, and I went from living with them to living with her,
and she just...
I could never do anything right.
She went from being my comfort to the monster in my life.
Now she was the person that was doing the beating, and she was beating me.
One time, we were in public somewhere, I did something, and she just... she went off on me in front of everybody, and I didn't show any emotion because when Mom...
when Mom would see you cry, she knew she could push your buttons.
That's what she wanted, and I would not give her that satisfaction.
When she would hit me, I would look her dead in her face... and she'd be like, "You better cry.
You better cry."
I wouldn't do it.
Times got really bad, to the point where I thought about committing suicide.
So, when I was 14, I flew to New York, and I wound up living with my dad and I never went back.
After we broke up, a lot of things happened.
She didn't file taxes.
She didn't take care of business.
She lost the house in Mount Vernon.
Everything went crazy.
She lived a nomadic life, having no manager, having no husband... but she always said living in Africa was the happiest time in her life.
She could just be there, enjoy herself.
She didn't have to sing at all.
She wasn't playing piano and she wasn't performing.
She said she hated the piano.
She hated it.
Think about it.
She's playing since she was four years old.
On the other hand, she was very well aware that in Africa, no money came in.
So she had to pick up her career again.
She didn't want to return to what she called,
"The United Snakes of America."
So she moved to Switzerland, which was the complete opposite of Africa, and the first thing she did was the Montreux concert.
You on yet?
Do you hear all those noises?
You didn't forget me, huh?
That's-
- That's what's so wild, you didn't forget me.
I didn't expect you to, but I'm tired.
You don't know what I mean.
And there are many people in show business who said,
"Oh, she-
- You know, she used to be a star.
She's gone all the way to the bottom,"
and all kinds of crap which means nothing to me at all.
I hope that you will see me or see the spirit in another sphere, on another plane very soon now.
And again, I don't wanna let you down and I get this feeling.
So I think the only way to tell you who I am these days... is to sing a song by Janis Ian.
Hey, girl, sit down!
Sit down!
Sit down!
In Switzerland, there I had no money.
I never got anything from Andy.
He just cut himself off from me and I was left high and dry.
So I left Switzerland and I went to Paris, thinking that I could resume my career.
I did it alone and I landed in the wrong place.
I was working every night in a small cafe for about $300 a night.
No, we just do "Vous Etes Seuls."
It goes like this!
I was desperate and no one believed that I was there.
I was too big to be there.
No one came to see me.
And I had fallen from grace.
I'm sorry that I didn't become the world's first black classic pianist.
I think I would have been happier.
I'm not very happy now.
I wouldn't change being part of the civil rights movement.
I wouldn't change that.
But some of the songs that I sang have hurt my career.
All of the controversial songs the industry decided to punish me for... and they put a boycott on all of my records, and it's, uh... hard for me to incorporate those songs anymore because they are not relevant to the times.
In terms of the civil rights movement, how far have we come?
There aren't any civil rights!
What do you mean?
There is no reason to sing those songs.
Nothing is happening.
There's no civil rights movement.
Everybody's gone.
I met Nina in 1967 and I've been her friend all her life.
She called me in 1982 and she was here in Paris, living in a very small apartment, hardly with any money.
She did concerts of four hours long at Trois Mailletz, that nightclub, and she got a few hundred dollars a night.
And that was the worst period.
I visited her in that little apartment and it was so dirty, so I cleaned it all up and, "Nina, you can't live like this,"
but at that moment, she was still uncontrollable.
This thing in the Grand Hotel in Paris happened.
Somebody looked her in the eyes a bit too long, and she was already a bit nervous and she kind of... made a movement and I thought, "She's going to hit him."
Immediately, my arms around her, and I dragged her out in a taxi and I said to the taxi driver, "Drive!"
When I saw her in Paris, she was like a street urchin dressed in rags.
I couldn't believe what was happening and I was really, really sad.
Gerrit and I, we knew something was very wrong, and we were trying to figure out, and like, "What is it?
What is it, really?"
So Gerrit found her a condo in Nijmegen in Holland, and Gerrit had a friend, a doctor, that he brought to Nina's place, and the doctor examined her and asked her questions, and he prescribed a medication
which was kind of new... new spectrum, called Trilafon.
It wasn't till I was in my 20s and I went to visit her in Nijmegen, that's when I learned the term "manic-depressive" and "bipolar"
and I remember asking,
"Well, what is that?
What do you mean by that?"
And her mood swings and a lot of the things I dealt with earlier in life when, you know, one minute she'd be happy and then the next minute...
I'd be dealing with someone that wasn't in the room five minutes ago.
It started to make sense.
She got so deep in the shit in the end that she realized it's either dying or give in.
And she gave in because we said, "Nina... we'll get you a house, we'll get you your musicians, we'll make the things all right around you, we'll book your concerts... but you have to do as we say.
You have to take your medicine.
You have to work.
God has given you the possibility to be able to do what you do, so do it!
The only thing we want to hear is either 'yes' or 'no.'"
And she said, with tears in her eyes, "Yes."
When I saw her,
I was very concerned because she had a... a nervous tic.
You know, she'd be talking or sitting and this--
Her mouth would always be twitching, and when she would walk, it was more of a shuffle.
And I'm like, "What's going on here?"
You know, "Why--
What's going on?
What am I missing?"
And they had her on medication.
She started taking the Trilafon and the doctor said,
"Through the years, it's going to have an effect on her motor skills.
Her voice is going to start to slur and her piano abilities will decline.
You can deal with that or you can deal with her probably damaging herself or someone else."
But the Trilafon really helped.
I mean, there were times in Holland, sitting on her terrace in these lounge chairs and just holding hands...
I mean, she was like-- She was my sister.
...and not talking at all for hours, just enjoying the day.
And I suppose that medication enabled her to perform and fulfill the business dealings that were taking place so that her career could get back on track, but there were times when I questioned that, you know, "But what about her heart?"
Because at the end of the day, you guys got wives and husbands and lives, but she's alone.
My personal life is a shambles.
I've had a few love affairs and I would love to be married, but everything has had to be sacrificed for the music.
We had to do, first in Holland, eight concerts, and the word spread that Nina's doing the job well.
Then she was on the road again and it was... poof.
The business was going.
She came onstage and you had this overwhelming, emotional feeling coming from the audience just because she was there.
Now listen to me.
I love you very much.
I think you know that and I know that you love me.
I know that.
And we never knew too well what was going to happen and how the mood would be.
So this place is very hot and it's very crowded and it's very ugly.
But she opened her heart and soul at that moment.
That's this special kind of connection she had with an audience.
This song is popular all over France.
It's from our first album... the very first album we made in this world, which is at least 25 years old.
I only wish I was as wise... could have been as wise then as I have become now.
I have suffered.
But there's a Bösendorfer here, so we'll see what happens.
"My Baby Just Cares For Me."
She was helped by "My Baby Just Cares For Me,"
that song that became a hit because of the Chanel advertisement.
And when "My Baby Just Cares For Me" came along, I said,
"I have to take this opportunity now to go all over the world because this is my last chance."
And so I worked very hard to take advantage of my second coming because it was my last time as far as I was concerned.
And she was happiest doing music.
I think that was her salvation.
That's the one thing that she didn't have to think about.
When she sat at the piano, her fingers could fly.
She was an anomaly.
She was a genius.
She was brilliant, and that brilliance shone through no matter what she was going through.
Even into her old age, she was brilliant.
She was genius.
She could do whatever she liked.
And when she didn't have her medicine, she, musically, could get even further out.
In one of those little concerts, and it's recorded, she starts playing one song and she sings another.
And this recording, I made Miles Davis... while we were on tour, we were on the same jazz tour as Miles Davis, and I made him listen to it, and he said, "Gerrit...
let me listen to it again!
How is she doing this?"
He couldn't understand.
As I got older, I started to look at her and I thought to myself,
"Wow, she's from another time!"
But she was not at odds with the times.
The times was at odds with her.
I think when a person moves to their own kind of clock, spirit, flow, if we were living in an environment that allowed us to be exactly who we are, you're always in congress with yourself.
The challenge is,
"How do we fit in in the world that we're around, but we--
Are we allowed to be exactly who we are?
Was Nina Simone allowed to be exactly who she was?"
As fragile as she was strong, as vulnerable as she was dynamic, she was African royalty.
How does royalty stomp around in the mud and still walk with grace?
Most people are afraid to be as honest as she lived.
Good night!

Hello.
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Hi!
We're ready.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
One, two, three.
I haven't seen you for many years, since 1968.
I have decided that I will do no more jazz festivals.
That decision has not changed.
I will sing for you, or we will do and share with you a few moments,
after which I shall graduate to a higher class, I hope, and I hope you will come with me.
We will start from the beginning, which was about a little girl,
and her name was Blue.

INTERVIEWER:
What's "free" to you, Nina?
- What's "free" to me?
- Yeah.
Same thing it is to you.
You tell me.
INTERVIEWER:
No, no, you tell me.
- [BOTH LAUGHING]
- INTERVIEWER:
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.
It's just a feeling.
It's like, "How do you tell somebody how it feels to be in love?"
How are you going to tell anybody who has not been in love how it feels to be in love?
You cannot do it to save your life.
You can describe things but you can't tell them, but you know it when it happens.
That's what I mean by "free."
I've had a couple of times onstage when I really felt free, and that's something else.
- [INTERVIEWER LAUGHS]
- That's really something else!
Like, all... all...
Like...
like...
I'll tell you what freedom is to me, no fear.
I mean, really, no fear.
If I could have that half of my life, no fear.
# I wish I could share #
# All the love that's in my heart #
# Remove all the bars #
# That still keep us apart #
# I wish you could know #
# What it means to be me #
# Then you'd see and agree #
# That every man should be free #
# I wish I could give #
# All I'm longing to give #
LISA SIMONE KELLY:
My mother was one of the greatest entertainers of all time, hands down... but she paid a huge price.
People seem to think that when she went out on stage, that was when she became Nina Simone.
My mother was Nina Simone 24/7... and that's where it became a problem.
- # One day I woke up and I could fly # - [CHORUS] # Yes, I know #
- # I'd look down at the sea # - # Yes, I know #
# And I wouldn't know myself #
# I'd have new hands #
- # I'd have new feet # - # Yes, I know #
- # I'd have new vision # - # Yes, I know #
- # My eyes would be open a little better # - # Yes, I know #
LISA:
When she was performing, she was brilliant, she was loved.
She was also a revolutionary.
She found a purpose for the stage, a place from which she could use her voice to speak out for her people.
- # Don't get in my way # - # Yes, I know #
[AUDIENCE CLAPPING AND CHEERING]
But when the show ended, everybody else went home.
She was alone and she was still fighting... but she was fighting her own demons... full of anger and rage.
She couldn't live with herself... and everything fell apart.
# For one moment of my whole life #
# I would know how #
# It would feel #
# To be free #
INTERVIEWER:
Good evening.
Our guest tonight is Nina Simone.
Probably the foremost blues singer, jazz singer, singer of all songs in the United States today.
Nina, are you happy with the kind of work you are doing?
NINA:
What makes me the happiest, is when I'm performing and there are people out there who feel with me and I know I touched them.
But to be completely honest, the whole thing seems so much like a dream.
I never thought I was gonna stay in show business.
When I first got into show business,
I wasn't a blues singer and I wasn't even a jazz singer.
I was a classical pianist.
I studied to become the first black classical pianist in America, and that's all that was on my mind.
That's what I was prepared to be.
I was born Eunice Waymon, which is my real name, by the way, in a town called Tryon, North Carolina.
I started to play the piano when I was three or four.
My mother was a preacher and she took me with her on her revivals, and I started to play the piano in church.
["CHILDREN GO WHERE I SEND YOU" PLAYING]
# Children go where I send you #
# How shall I send you?
#
# I'm gonna send you one by one #
# One for the little biddy baby was born, born, born in Bethlehem #
Revival meetings were some of the most exciting times that I've ever had.
The music was so intense, you just sort of went out of yourself.
I felt it tremendously.
I was leading it.
When I was seven, the choir of our church gave a program at the local theater, and I was on that program...
And I played some song, I don't remember what it was, and these two women, two white women, in the audience heard me.
One of them was the woman that my mother worked for, and the other one was a music teacher, Mrs. Mazzanovich, and they decided right then and there to give me lessons.
And so, for five years after that,
I studied piano, classical piano, with this teacher.
I crossed the railroad tracks every weekend to get to Mrs. Mazzanovich.
And, you know, railroad tracks in the South are supposed to be dividing the blacks from the whites.
Well, it really did.
I was so scared.
Mrs. Mazzanovich frightened me.
It was her being white, in the sense that I had never seen.
She was alien to me.
Her white hair, the combs in it, her pleasantness...
I loved that.
And she started me on Bach.
And this Bach, I liked him.
Mrs. Mazzanovich had it in her mind that I was gonna be one of the world's greatest concert pianists.
So it was all very disciplined classical music.
Bach, Beethoven, Debussy, Brahms, you name it.
Then Mrs. Mazzanovich got a fund together, "Eunice Waymon Fund,"
and I gave lots of recitals, and they would take up collection to further my education after I had left her.
LISA:
Mommy took to all of the training like a fish to water, but it was a double-edged sword.
She had a very lonely life because she was practicing seven, eight hours a day.
NINA:
When I first started to take lessons,
I became terribly aware of how isolated I was from the other children, and how isolated I was from the white community and the negro community.
I felt it, all the time, even when the kids used to play with me.
They always wanted me just to play the piano for them to dance.
I wasn't asked too much to do anything else.
That was very hard.
Part of that isolation, of course, was the thing about color.
I was a black girl, and I knew about it, and I lived in it.
I lived in the South for 17 years.
LISA:
My mom rarely referred to Jim Crow and segregation and a lot of the racial issues that were going on at that stage in her life.
But she did tell me about times when she was told her nose was too big, her lips were too full and her skin was too dark.
And after she was told that, they probably told her,
"There's only certain things you'll be good for in your life."
NINA:
What I knew, I knew.
But we weren't allowed to mention anything racial in our house.
I wasn't consciously dealing with race.
That wasn't consciously on my mind at all... until years later.
After I graduated from high school, the money that had been saved from the Eunice Waymon Fund sent me to New York to Juilliard for a year and a half.
And then I applied for a scholarship to Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
I was playing Czerny and Liszt and Rachmaninoff and Bach.
I knew I was good enough, but they turned me down, and it took me about six months to realize it was because I was black.
I never really got over that jolt of racism at the time.
Then the money ran out and the reality hit me that I had to go to work.
My parents had moved the whole family to Philadelphia to be near me, and my family is very poor, so I had to work.
What else was there for me to do?
So, I got myself a job in Atlantic City for a summer.
It was a very crummy bar and I used to go in in evening gowns.
I didn't know any better.
And I played everything that I could think of.
Pop songs, classical, spirituals, all kinds of things.
It was very strange.
And I had never sung before, and the owner came in the second night and told me if I wanted to keep the job, I had to sing.
So, $90 was more money than I had ever heard of in my life, so I said, "Well, I'll sing," and ever since then, I've been singing.
ROGER NUPIE:
Eunice Waymon was playing in the bars to support her family and to have money to continue her classical piano training.
But since she didn't want her mother to know that she was playing "the devil's music" in bars, she changed her name.
Eunice Waymon became Nina Simone.
She named herself "Niña," meaning "little one,"
and she had a boyfriend who called her "Niña,"
and "Simone" came from the French actress Simone Signoret.
NINA:
I didn't want my mother to find out.
I knew she would hate it.
So I, kind of, kept it from her for a long, long time.
INTERVIEWER:
Was it lonely for a young girl entertaining in these strange bars?
NINA:
Extremely.
Extremely lonely.
INTERVIEWER:
Working peculiar hours, I imagine.
NINA:
12:00 midnight to 7:00 in the morning.
INTERVIEWER:
It ruined your social life, uh...
NINA:
Never had much of one.
INTERVIEWER:
Why'd you keep on with it?
NINA:
Couldn't help it.
I have to play and I needed money.
It was always a matter of necessity from day to day what I'm going to do.
I didn't even know I was going to stay in show business.
I never thought about a choice.
NINA: [SINGING] # Nobody's fault but mine #
AL SCHACKMAN:
From the beginning, I felt there was something eating at her.
You know, "What's eating at you, Nina?"
And, um... gradually that got stronger.
# For all we know #
# We may never meet again #
AL:
The first time I played with Nina, it was the summer of 1957 at a restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania.
She didn't look at me.
Said nothing, as though I wasn't...
I wasn't even there, and started in on a song.
She never told me what key she was going to be in.
She just started playing, and I knew exactly where I was going to go with it.
It was like we had a telepathic relationship.
Before you knew it, we were just weaving in and out.
And then she looked up.
# Until... # # ...the last minute #
NINA:
Al Schackman is a terribly sensitive, creative man.
He has perfect pitch, which means that no matter what key I'm in, he's able to adapt himself immediately, 'cause I do that all the time.
I'll change the key in the middle of a tune.
AL:
Nina had a wonderful way of taking a piece of music, and... not interpreting it, but...
but, like, metamorphosizing it.
You know, morphing it into her experience.
# This may only be a dream #
NINA:
What I was interested in was conveying an emotional message, which means using everything you've got inside you sometimes to barely make a note or if you have to strain to sing, you sing.
So sometimes I sound like gravel, and sometimes I sound like coffee and cream.
# So baby, love me, love me tonight #
# Tomorrow was made for some #
GEORGE WEIN:
When I first saw Nina at my club in 1959,
I was impressed.
She was different.
She mixed in folk music with jazz.
She played very fine piano.
Her voice was totally different from anybody else.
It was a woman's voice, but it had the depth of a baritone.
That depth and that darkness carried the insight of what was in Nina's soul... and it reached you very quickly.
# For all... #
# ...we know #
She was an artist.
She was an original artist.
So we paid attention, and in 1960, I put her on the Newport Jazz Festival, and she was a hit there.
[BAND PLAYING]
# I got a beau you ain't got none Little Liza Jane #
# I got a beau you ain't got none Little Liza Jane #
# I got a beau you ain't got none Little Liza Jane #
# I got a beau you ain't got none Little Liza Jane #
# Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane #
# Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane #
STANLEY CROUCH:
Her sound is so original.
When she first appeared... she was one of those musicians who...
Once...
You don't have to hear them a bunch.
If you hear them once, then the next time you hear 'em, you say,
"Oh, that's that same one I heard last week.
Nobody sounds like that except her."
# Come my love and live with me #
# I will take good care of thee, little Liza Jane #
AL:
At Newport, she was sitting on a high stool with a tambourine, and I was in the back.
She wasn't sure she wanted to go through with it.
If I remember right, she was a little, you know, "What am I doing here?"
And I said, "You're here because, you know, you belong here."
# He took me to this great big town #
# Lot of people standing around #
# Little Liza Jane, Jane, Jane... #
And she said, "Okay, Al, but you better play."
[LAUGHS] And I said, "Don't worry, I'll play."
# Oh little Liza, little Liza Jane #
# Oh little Liza, little Liza Jane #
But then, if you watch during her performance of "Little Liza,"
she has that little smile from time to time.
She let go, and it was really cute.
# Little Liza Jane, Jane Little ol' Liza #
# Little Liza Jane, Jane Little ol' Liza #
# Little Liza Jane, Jane Little ol' Liza #
NINA:
Then I recorded seven or eight tunes that I had been doing all of those years, and of course, the public picked out "I Loves You Porgy."
It was not pushed or promoted to be a hit at all.
- Girls!
Guys!
Hi.
- Hi, Hugh, nice to see you.
Real good.
Eleanor, you want to, uh, take Don's coat here, and maybe you can show the girls where the powder room is and bedroom.
Hello, there.
Very nice to have you with us this evening.
This is Playboy's Penthouse, and I'm Hugh Hefner, editor/publisher of Playboy magazine.
I'd like you to meet someone that I think most of you know, Nina Simone.
She came out of nowhere in the last year as a recording star.
Now has a very, very big record in "Porgy"
that is breaking all kinds of sales records.
We're very happy she could join us
- tonight on Playboy's Penthouse...
- Thanks.
...and she's going to play and sing a little bit for us now with her group.
- [ALL CLAPPING] - [PLAYING PIANO]
Do you want to hear "Porgy"?
- ALL:
Very much!
- Right!
Good, that's what we'll do.
# I love you, Porgy #
# Don't let him take me #
# Don't let him handle me #
# And drive me mad #
# If you can keep me #
# I'm gonna stay here with you forever #
# And I'll be glad #
# Yes, I loves you, Porgy #
# Don't let him take me #
# Sweetie, don't let him handle me #
# With his hot hands #
# If you can keep me #
# I'm gonna stay here with you forever #
# I've got my man #
INTERVIEWER:
Nina, there's a man named Andy Stroud.
He walked into your life and became a permanent part.
How did you meet your husband?
NINA:
He came to see me at a nightclub and a mutual friend introduced us.
Nina came to the table and sat, and I was eating a hamburger plate, and there were fries, and she dipped into them.
And she wanted to know if it was okay.
I said, "All right."
We got cute and then she gave me that card with a note on it.
Then I went over to see her at her place in the next day or two.
# But when he comes I know #
# I'll have to go #
# I love you, Porgy #
INTERVIEWER:
How did you know that Andy Stroud was to be your husband and not just another guy out for a date or something else?
[NINA LAUGHS] That's a hard question.
He told me that he had wanted to meet me for a long time.
And he had come for me.
I fell in love with him.
Then later, he scared me to death.
He was so, you know...
He knew what he wanted and he just took over.
# With you forever #
He abandoned his own career as a sergeant of the police department to manage me, and for the first time, I knew what it was not to be just floundering out there.
# ...got my man #
[SONG ENDS]
[ALL CLAPPING]
AL:
I just remember meeting Andy.
Here was a tough, New York, you know, vice squad cop, that when he stepped out of his car uptown, people ran.
And he had... he had a way of just saying one word...
[IN DEEP VOICE] "Hey."
...and that could put a lot of fear in people.
But Andy and Nina married in 1961.
He retired from the police force and became her manager, and he did well for her.
They bought a beautiful house in Mount Vernon, New York.
NINA:
We had a 13-room house, four acres of land, lot of trees.
NINA: [SINGING] # My baby don't care for shows #
# My baby don't care for clothes #
# My baby just cares for me #
# My baby don't care for cars and races #
# My baby don't care for... # # ...high-tone places #
NINA:
And Lisa was born nine months later.
The first three hours after Lisa was born were the most peaceful in my life, and I was in love with the world.
And Andrew was there.
He was sitting right there, and he said...
I said, "How's the baby?" He says, "How's the mother?"
And I loved him for that.
I loved being a mother.
I was a good mother.
I was a goddamn good mother.
LISA:
I remember our house in Mount Vernon like the back of my hand.
It was like a fairy tale.
I remember seeing the paisley on the walls.
The walls were kind of like a... [SIGHS]
They were hued in gold, but it really wasn't gold.
It was more like a muted gold but it felt like it was velvet.
So I'd always run my hands, like, over the walls, because it was textured.
And my mom, she had her cold storage where she kept her fur coats and her costumes.
So I was always in there.
ANDY:
These were the good, sweet days.
We were building and growing together.
[SONG CONTINUES]
ANDY:
I had an overall plan to develop and create her as an artist.
I had set up an office at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street.
I had a publicist.
I had a guy who was a record-promotion man that I got from Atlantic Records.
I had another fellow who did the college radio station promotion, and a photographer.
Dad was the original Puff Daddy.
I mean, he really had a vision, and he was a very astute businessman.
ANDY:
And of course, she was burning to get on to Carnegie Hall.
She had trained as a classical pianist with the one thought in mind of being the first black female classical pianist to appear in Carnegie Hall.
That was her prime objective.
However, none of the New York City promoters would undertake this project.
So, I took my own money to promote the appearance.
She was ecstatic.
I mean, she was out of her mind with joy.
INTERVIEWER:
You apparently wrote a letter to your parents saying,
"This is where you wanted me to play,
- but I should have been playing Bach."
- NINA: "Playing Bach."
INTERVIEWER:
So this was your glory occasion, but you were still disappointed?
NINA:
Well, I loved the audience, but I wasn't playing classical music, and I wanted to be, and so I wrote,
"Yes, I'm in Carnegie Hall, finally, but I'm not playing Bach."
[APPLAUSE]
NINA: [SINGING] # I can't go on without you #
# Your love is all I'm living for #
# I love all things about you #
# Your heart, your soul, my love #
[SONG ENDS]
[APPLAUSE]
[JAZZ PIANO PLAYING]
# Say love me, leave me Let me be lonely #
# You won't believe me but I love you only #
ANDY:
After Carnegie Hall, she was getting airplay all over the country, magazine pictures and stories.
# Nighttime is my time for just reminiscing #
# Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else #
She became highly successful and recognized.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- Oh!
Thank you very much!
- MAN:
Meeting in Japan.
HOST 1:
A young woman who's made a very emphatic name for herself...
ANNOUNCER:
An accomplished pianist and distinctive...
HOST 2: ...who's now become a rather famous artist.
HOST 3:
A remarkable blues-soul sound.
HOST 4:
For the first time on British television,
The High Priestess of Soul...
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
- Nina Simone.
- Nina Simone.
The great Nina Simone.
HOST 1:
Miss Simone brings to her music a kind of technique and discipline we generally associate with classical music.
She has introduced fugue and counterpoint into the freewheeling spontaneity of the jazz world.
INTERVIEWER:
Nina, do you think that now that you are successful as a popular artist that you'd like to do any classical?
NINA:
Yes, but I don't have time to think about it too much.
But you have to realize that when I'm most satisfied with my music,
I call upon all of the things that I have learned in classical music.
ANDY:
She wanted everything that money and success could buy.
So I promised her that she was going to be a rich black bitch.
NINA:
We had a blackboard and he used to put on there,
"I'll be a rich black bitch by this such-and-such date,"
and he said, "Then you could quit," and I always believed him, but I never could quit because he worked me too hard.
NINA: [SINGING] # Breaking up big rocks on the chain gang #
# Breaking rocks and serving my time #
# Breaking up big rocks on the chain gang #
# 'Cause they done convicted me of crime #
# Hold it right there while I hit it #
# Well, I reckon that ought to get it #
# Been workin' and workin' #
# But I still got so terribly far to go #
# I committed crime Lord, I needed #
# Crime of being hungry and poor #
AL:
Andy said, "Nina, it's hard work.
You wanna make the money, you have to work."
And she resented that.
Then Lisa was born, and she resented being torn away, having to go on the road.
# Well, reckon that ought to get it #
# Been working and working... #
LISA:
I didn't realize what my mom did for a living.
I just know that Mom was always traveling.
My mother often told me that I had 13 nannies in seven years.
So, while she was trying to maintain some sense of a schedule for me and normalcy for me, she was out there doing what she was doing.
NINA:
Can I have five more minutes?
It's very frustrating...
AL:
When we were on the road, there were times we had to be careful.
She could get angry and start arguments with people.
Y'all pushing!
You're pushing!
Don't put nothin' in it!
Let's do it again.
AL:
If anyone were talking in the audience, she would just sit, and at first, she would say, "Please..."
and she said, "I'm not continuing."
She'd get up, walk out, and the gig was over.
NINA:
I just want them to listen to the music like they did in the classical world.
I thought they needed teaching.
If they couldn't listen, fuck it!
ANDY:
She got into Carnegie Hall, and she got the big house in the country, but she began questioning herself.
She'd get into moods of depression about the whole business, the personal relationship, cursing and smashing things, and this worsened as the time went by.
# Gonna see my sweet honey baby #
# Gonna break this chain off and run #
# I'm gonna lay down somewhere shady #
NINA:
All I did was work, work, work.
I was always tired.
I was always tired.
I could never sleep.
You see, music always goes through my head, which means the more I played, the less I could relax.
I kept thinking Andy would let me rest.
He never did.
# But I still... # # ...got so terribly far to go #
- [SONG ENDS] - [APPLAUSE]
# Got my liver #
AL:
She felt she was being handled like a racehorse, and she was always fighting, fighting, fighting it.
Andy would say, "Nina, we've got a career here.
That's not going to continue if you don't nurture it."
So, she came to resent Andy... but she was afraid of Andy.
NINA:
Andrew protected me against everybody but himself.
He wrapped himself around me like a snake.
I worked like a dog, and I was scared of him... and Andrew beat me up.
But I've never talked to you about this.
But he beat me up.
I was deathly scared of Andrew.
# I put a spell on you #
# 'Cause you're mine #
One time, early in the morning, like 4:00, 5:00 in the morning, uh... the phone rings.
It's Nina, and she needed to hide out.
# I ain't lying #
NINA:
I had gone to a discotheque with Andrew... and a fan came up to me and gave me a note, and he saw me take this note and put it in my pocket.
# You're runnin' around You know better, Daddy #
AL:
She thought nothing of it.
I mean, she related this to me.
And Andy came back and grabbed her arm and took her out from the place and beat her up.
NINA:
And when I got out on the street, he started raining blows on me.
Bloody blows.
He beat me all the way home, up the stairs, in the elevator, in my room, put a gun to my head.
Then he tied me up and raped me.
She came to my place and...
and she was beat up.
And I, you know, put her to bed, and... and she, you know, rested for a couple of days.
NINA:
He didn't find me for two weeks.
My eyes, I couldn't see.
And he said, "Who beat you up like that?"
And I said, "You did!"
He said, "No, I didn't.
I've been looking for you for two weeks."
I said, "You're insane!"
He was brutal... but I...
I loved him and I guess I just believed he wouldn't do it anymore.
# You're mine #
LISA:
My mother always said, till the day she died,
Dad was the best manager that she ever had.
But on top of being charismatic, he could be a bully and he could be very mean, and she was on the receiving end of that... more times than, you know, she should have been,
which should have been never.
Mom would allude to, you know,
"He's rammed my head into a concrete wall."
She said that he punched her in the stomach when she was pregnant with me.
LISA:
As a child, I remember sitting in the car between them and they were arguing about something, and I remember my father reaching across me, so it was like this, and backhanding her.
ANDY:
We're going home in the car, I'm driving, and I slapped her.
Blood spurted... right over this eyebrow.
She had, like, a one-inch cut from my ring, you know.
We got her home and I clipped the skin together and taped it... and a week later, there wasn't even a scar.
LISA:
I think they were both nuts.
She stayed with him.
She had this love affair with fire.
That's like inviting the bull with the red cape,
"Just come on into my kitchen and let's see what we can do."
That's what she did.
- What do I want for her?
- INTERVIEWER:
Yes.
Myself.
What else?
- [LAUGHING]
- INTERVIEWER:
Career-wise.
LISA:
My father had a strategic plan in terms of how Mom's career was going to go.
He wanted her to be able to win all the awards, and to become the huge star that he knew that she could be... but she wanted something more.
There was something missing in her, some meaning.
- [BOOMING] - [GLASS SHATTERING]
NEWSCASTER 1:
They died in Birmingham, the nation's most segregated big city.
Dynamite exploded on Sunday morning, killed four little girls, injured 20 other Negroes.
NEWSCASTER 2:
It was one of more than 40 bombings in that Birmingham area.
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
JAMES BALDWIN:
Kids were murdered in Birmingham on a Sunday and in Sunday schools in a Christian nation,
- and nobody cares!
- [BANGS PODIUM]
NINA:
When the kids got killed in that church... that did it.
First you get depressed, and after that, you get mad.
And when these kids got bombed,
I just sat down and wrote this song.
And it's a very... moving, violent song, 'cause that's how I feel about the whole thing.
# Alabama's gotten me so upset Tennessee made me lose my rest #
# Everybody knows about Mississippi, goddam #
# Can't you see it?
I know you can feel it #
# It's all in the air #
# I can't stand this pressure much longer #
# Somebody say a prayer #
# Alabama's gotten me so upset And Tennessee's made me lose my rest #
# Everybody knows about Mississippi, goddam #
DICK GREGORY: "Mississippi Goddam."
Phew!
Hmm?
Got my attention.
What she was doing was different.
There's something about a woman... if you look at all the suffering that black folks went through... not one black man would dare say, "Mississippi, goddam."
And then to have someone with her stature talking about your problem, you know how happy they had to be?
We all wanted to say it.
She said it.
"Mississippi, goddam!"
# Hound dogs on my trail #
# School children sitting in jail #
# Black cat cross my path #
# I think every day's gonna be my last #
# Oh, but my country is full of lies #
# We all gonna die and die like flies #
# I don't trust nobody any more #
# They keep on saying, "Go slow" #
LISA:
For Mommy to write a song called "Mississippi Goddam"
was revolutionary.
They didn't have cursing on the radio or on television or anything.
DJs refused to play it, and boxes of the 45s used to be sent back from the radio stations cracked in two.

AL:
As the civil rights movement really swung into high gear, she swung into high gear with it.
In '65, we played at the Selma March in Montgomery, Alabama.
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.:
We have a legal and constitutional right
- to march from Selma to Montgomery!
- [CROWD CHEERING]
AL:
It was extremely dangerous.
The federal Marshals were called in, and they were standing on the tops of all the buildings downtown with guns.
ANDY:
Seated in front of the stage facing the audience was Martin Luther King,
Ralph Bunche from the UN and a lot of other worldwide dignitaries.
AL:
You had Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Sidney Poitier,
Bill Cosby, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Belafonte, and we did "Mississippi Goddam."
# Can't you see it?
Can't you feel it?
#
# It's all in the air #
# I can't stand the pressure much longer #
# Somebody say a prayer #
# Alabama's got me so upset #
# Selma made me lose my rest #
[CROWD CHEERING]
# Everybody knows about Mississippi, goddam #
LISA:
My mother said that after she sang that song, she got so angry that her voice broke... and from "Mississippi Goddam" on, it never, ever returned to its former octave.
[CROWD SINGING "GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN"]
But I think that Mom's anger is what sustained her.
The energy and the creativity and the passion of those days is really what kept her going.
ANDY:
When she wrote "Mississippi Goddam,"
I thought it was something else.
You know, I liked it.
They put a 45 out on it, and I knew it had a lot of impact.
But my complaint was that while I was always pushing for the commercial side of the picture, she got sidetracked with all of these civil rights activities.
NINA:
When the civil rights thing came up, all of a sudden,
I could let myself be heard about what I'd been feeling all the time.
When I was young, I knew to stay alive.
As a black family, we had to work at it.
We had to keep secrets.
We never complained about being poor, or being taken advantage of or not getting our share.
We had to keep our mouths shut as I walked across that railroad track every Saturday.
So I knew to break the silence meant a confrontation with the white people of that town.
NINA: [SINGING] # Southern trees #
And though I didn't know I knew it, if the black man rises up and says, "I'm just not gonna do that anymore..."
# Bearin' strange fruit # ...he stands to get murdered.
# Blood on the leaves #
But no one mentioned that, which is, indeed, quite strange.
# And blood at the roots #
# Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze #
NINA:
It touched me first time when I gave a recital at this library.
Everybody was seated and they told me my parents had to sit in the back, and I said,
"If they have to sit in the back, I won't perform."
They fixed it that time and they brought them to the front and they let them sit down, but it was my first feeling of being discriminated against, and I recoiled in horror at such a thing.

I choose to reflect the times and the situations in which I find myself.
That, to me, is my duty... and at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when every day is a matter of survival,
I don't think you can help but be involved.
Young people, black and white, know this, and so that's why they're so involved in politics.
We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore.
So I don't think you have a choice...
How can you be an artist and not reflect the times?

I've always thought that I was shaking people up, but now I want to go at it more and I want to go at it more deliberately and I want to go at it coldly.
I want...
I want to shake people up so bad that when they leave a nightclub where I've performed,
I just want them to be to pieces.

NINA:
Rise up!
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]
It's all right if you dance slow!
But it was very exhilarating to be part of that movement at the time because I was needed.
Now I could sing to help my people, and that became the mainstay of my life.
Not classical piano, not classical music, not even popular music, but civil rights music.
I got to know Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Andrew Young, and artists, actors, actresses, poets, writers, people like myself who felt compelled to make the stand that I have.
ROGER:
It was very important for her to connect with the writers and playwrights of that moment because those people had the intellectual background of the movement and she didn't have that.
She had music, the musical background.
For instance, Langston Hughes, he wrote the lyrics for "Backlash Blues" for her.
Lorraine Hansberry, Nina took her play, Young, Gifted, and Black, and made a song out of it.
It's regarded as one of the most important songs in the civil rights movement.
NINA:
I know that there are only 300 black students here in this college of 18,000.
So this song is dedicated only to you.
# To be young, gifted and black #
# Oh, what a lovely, precious dream #
# To be young, gifted and black #
NINA:
Lorraine Hansberry was my best friend, and she wrote plays, Raisin in the Sun and Young, Gifted, and Black.
She taught me a lot about Karl Marx, Lenin, philosophy.
[LORRAINE HANSBERRY] The basic fabric of our society that has Negroes in the situation that they are in is the thing which must be changed, you know.
# Who are young, gifted and black #
LISA:
Those times were pretty amazing.
I look back now and I'm just like, "Wow!
Who's who of Black America!"
Lorraine Hansberry was my godmother.
Malcolm X's wife, Betty Shabazz, was my auntie.
They lived right next door in Mount Vernon.
There are six daughters and I was like the seventh.
So I was always riding my bike over there.
Lisa and I were the same age, and...
I think we may have called one another twins.
It was just a great, great time.
There was music, there were discussions.
Whether it was at our house or Lisa's house, Nina Simone's home, it was definitely party with a purpose.
[AMBASSADOR SHABAZZ] We happened to be a fly on the wall with some of the genius poets and poetesses of the time, the era.
And to sit in that room and listen...
These were brilliant, well-read, well-traveled, charming, alluring, charismatic people who were moved to make a difference in the world.
I'm born of the Young, Gifted, and Black affirmation.
For me, and those of us in that environment, it was daring to proclaim it... and then share it joyously when she sang it.
# To be young, gifted and black #
SHABAZZ:
People would stand up and engage in their African-ness without apology... and it's a contemporary, hip song of the era.
It means you get to hum it in public.
[LAUGHS]
# It's where it's at #
[CROWD CHEERING]
ANDY:
She became a legend in the activists' movement, and through meetings and discussions that I overheard, she was convinced that certain things must be done in order to... push the revolution.
I told them that's not the answer, and then it began to manifest in her attitude towards me and the business.
She'd fly off.
I remember a few nights, you know, you go to bed happy and holding one another.
I wake up, and she'd be sitting up in bed with her arms folded, looking at me, thinking about killing me.
And this is how it went.
The political work became very heavy.
NINA:
To me, we are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world, black people.
So my job is to make them more curious about where they came from and their own identity and pride in that identity.
That's why my songs...
I try to make them as powerful as possible, mostly just to make them curious about themselves.
We don't know anything about ourselves.
We don't even have the pride and the dignity of African people, but we can't even talk about where we came from.
We don't know.
It's like a lost race.

I really mean to provoke this feeling of, like, "Who am I?

You know, "Do I really like me?" and, "Why do I like me?"
And, like, you know, "If I am black and beautiful,
I really am and I know it, and I don't care who cares or says what."

NINA:
This is what compels me to push black people to identify with black culture.
Giving out to them that black-ness, that black power.
# Got my heart, got my soul #
# Got my back #
# I got my sex #
STANLEY CROUCH:
Nina was a real rebel.
She didn't really fit in the revolutionary black female role that was offered her.
She could avoid pretentious phoniness and get more depth out of a song than people are used to hearing out of those songs.
# I got my freedom #
She was a kind of patron saint of the rebellion.
[SONG ENDS]
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]
AL:
Nina started to get more aggressive.
I remember one time as she walked right up to Dr. King and said,
"I'm not non-violent!"
And he said, "That's okay, sister.
You don't have to be."
NINA:
I was never non-violent.
Never.
I thought we should get our rights by any means necessary.
AL:
And then she met Stokely Carmichael.
Miss Simone says something very significant in her song "Mississippi Goddam."
She says, "This country..." She says, "This country is built on lies."
You're gonna sit in front of your television set and listen to LBJ tell you that,
"Violence never accomplishes anything, my fellow Americans."
And the honky drafting you out of school to go fight in Vietnam.
If you don't want any trouble, keep your filthy white hands off our beautiful black skin.
- Keep them off!
- [CROWD CHEERING WILDLY]
NINA:
I am just one of the people who is sick of the social order, sick of the establishment, sick to my soul of it all.
To me, America's society is nothing but a cancer, and it must be exposed before it can be cured.
I am not the doctor to cure it.
All I can do is expose the sickness.
[PEOPLE CLAMORING]
Are you ready, black people?
CROWD:
Yeah!
Are you ready, black people?
CROWD:
Yeah!
MEN: [SINGING] # Are you ready?
#
- Are you really ready?
- CROWD:
Yeah!
ANDY:
She wanted to align herself with the extreme terrorist militants who were influencing her.
And after all of these meetings with all these people, she would come to me and,
"Let's get the guns.
Let's poison the reservoir."
All sorts of violent terrorist acts.
Are you ready to call the wrath of black gods... black magic...
CROWD:
Yeah!
...to do your bidding?
NINA:
Black people are never going to get their rights unless they have their own separate state.
And if we'd have armed revolution, there'd be a lot of blood.
I think we'd have that separate state.
Are you ready to smash white things?
CROWD:
Yeah!
To burn buildings, are you ready?
CROWD:
Yeah!
ROGER:
At a certain point, Nina started to play only political songs and nothing else, and that started to hurt her career.
That became a problem to book her, because promoters were a little bit afraid that it might only be the political message that you were getting.
Are you ready to kill if necessary?
CROWD:
Yeah!
Is your mind ready?
CROWD:
Yeah!
- Is your body ready?
- CROWD:
Yeah!
NINA:
If I'd had my way, I'd have been a killer.
I would have had guns, and I would have gone to the South and gave them violence for violence, shotgun for shotgun, but my husband told me...
I didn't know anything about guns, and he refused to teach me, and the only thing I had was music, so I obeyed him.
But if I'd had my way, I wouldn't be sitting here today.
I'd be probably dead.
Are you really, really, really ready?
CROWD:
Yeah!
ANDY:
She's putting down the white people...
[MIMICS DOG] I mean, you know, like a barking dog, but she still wanted all the good things.
Whenever she'd see, like, Aretha Franklin and Gladys Knight and all of these people on the prime television shows, she, of course, was very upset because she wasn't able to get on to these shows because of her reputation.
It got so that there wasn't that much work and the expenses were high.
It was cutting the legs out from all the work that I had done.
- See you later.
- [CROWD CHEERING]
I'll see you later.
LISA:
I remember my dad complaining about the fact that she never stopped speaking out, but that's who she was.
It was okay when you were onstage.
It's okay 'cause you let it all hang out, and then when the show ends and the lights go out,
"Okay, let's put the monkey back in the cage, and eat your banana and, you know, just behave yourself."
It was like she was penalized and punished for being herself.
That's a very painful, lonely place to be.
[TAPE ROLLING]
INTERVIEWER:
Good evening.
Tonight my guest in the studio with me needs almost no introduction.
She is Miss Nina Simone.
Nina, when it comes to the artists today, we find that more of the artists are attempting to alert America to the need for change.
Is this really the artist's role?
NINA:
Well, I think it's something that, um, I have chosen to do and I have felt compelled to do it.
So it is my role... but sometimes, I wish it wasn't.
I think that the artists who don't get involved in preaching messages probably are happier, but you see, I have to live with Nina, and that is very difficult.
# Baby, do you understand me now?
#
[APPLAUSE]
# If sometimes you see that I'm mad #
# No one can always be an angel #
# When everything goes wrong you see some bad #
# But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good #
# Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood #
I think 19 people depend on me for their livelihood.
That's a hell of a lot of people.
I know that if I say, "Well, look, I'm too tired to work tonight,"
I'm gonna get it from both ends.
Nobody's going to understand or care that I'm too tired.
I'm very aware of that.
Now, I would like some freedom, somewhere... where I didn't feel those pressures.
# Don't let me be misunderstood #
# Cause if I'm misunderstood #
# All my life would have been in vain #
# And Lord knows I don't want to come here again #
# So don't let me be... #
AL:
By the late '60s, I realized that Nina was fighting demons that could appear at any moment and you wouldn't know it.
She could get violent, she could get really physical, and the change in her would be dramatic... boom, like a switch.
And I...
I, after a while, realized that I was...
I wasn't with my sister, I was with "that one..."
and that one was... menacing.
# Don't let me be misunderstood #
ANDY:
She was very concerned, in her sane moments, about these fits of depression and anger.
We even went to Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital,
I think, signed her in for four or five days.
They conducted every test known to... medicine at the time and they were unable to find anything.
NINA: [SINGING] # Give me a clear mind #
# Give me the words to say what I mean #
# Don't let me be misunderstood #
ANDY:
And her downward spiral, it just got worse and worse.
We did a tour with Bill Cosby, and the last night, she became erratic.
She had a can of shoe polish.
She was putting it in her hair.
And she began talking gibberish, and she was totally out of it, incoherent.
It appeared she was having a nervous breakdown.
And when it came time to go on,
I had to escort her by holding her arm onto the stage and sat her down at the piano, and I immediately stood in the wings on the opposite side where we could see one another.
She's watching me pantomime and she performed.
Basically, she had no control over her emotions, and underneath it all, sex dominated her.
There were times, once or twice a week, when there was a sex attack when she goes into a maniacal rage.
There had to be sex.
I mean, this is driving her.
NINA:
My attitude towards sex was that we should have it all the time.
INTERVIEWER:
How did Andy act towards you?
NINA:
I just wanted him to move me sexually, and he never was able to.
INTERVIEWER:
Right.
NINA:
He didn't know how to touch me and he never had enough time.
He'd come to see me late at night and be there two hours and leave.
ANDY:
I knew that she was dating other people.
We agreed that we could both have our own outside partners... but we would work together for the sake of the business and the child.
SHABAZZ:
I can't sit here and speak about Aunt Nina and Uncle Andy's marriage.
What I can say is that participation and activism during the '60s... rendered chaos in any individual's lives.
People sacrificed sanity, well-being, life.
Nina Simone was a free spirit in an era that didn't really appreciate a woman's genius.
So what does that do to a household and a family?
Not because of income, but because of your soul not being able to do what you need to do.
[GUN COCKS]

[PEOPLE SCREAMING]
ANNOUNCER:
Direct from our newsroom in Washington, this is the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite.
Good evening.
Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
Jesus!
[SOBBING] Jesus.
CRONKITE:
There was shock in the nation's negro communities.
Men, women and children poured into the streets.
They appeared dazed.
Many were crying.
STOKELY:
I think White America made its biggest mistake when she killed Dr. King last night.
He was the one man in our race who was trying to teach our people to have love, compassion, and mercy for what white people had done.
When White America killed Dr. King last night, she killed all reasonable hope.
NINA:
We want to do a tune written... for today... for this hour for Dr. Martin Luther King.
We had yesterday to learn it, and... so we'll see.
# Once upon this planet Earth #
# Lived a man of humble birth #
# Preaching love and freedom #
# For his fellow man #
# He was dreaming of the day #
# Peace would come to Earth to stay #
NINA:
Last year, Lorraine Hansberry left us, and she was a dear friend, and then Langston Hughes left us.
Who can go on?
Do you realize how many we have lost?
Then it really gets down to reality, doesn't it?
Not a performance.
Not microphones and all that crap, but really something else.
We can't afford any more losses.
[VOICE BREAKING]
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
They're shooting us down, one by one.
Don't forget that... 'cause they are... killing us one by one.
# If you have to die, it's all right #
# 'Cause you know what life is #
# You know what freedom is #
# For one moment of your life #
# What's gonna happen #
[PEOPLE CLAMORING]
# Now that the King of love is dead?
#
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
[SIRENS BLARING]
NINA:
I knew that we were lost.
I felt chased all the time, no matter what I did or how sad I got.
I felt that there was just no life for me in the country.
I knew I had to quit or I had to leave Andy or do something.
So I took my ring off, put it on the table... and I left the country.
# I left a note on his dresser #
# And my old wedding ring #
# With these few... # # ...goodbye words #
LISA:
According to my godsister Attallah Shabazz...
I was staying with them, and Mom had gone away, and the phone would ring and whenever it would ring,
I would go running, saying, "Is that my mommy on the phone?"
And then I remember going back to the house in Mount Vernon and Dad just wasn't there.
He wasn't there.
And nobody told me anything, you know?
[STAMMERS] And, um, so...
One day you're at home and the staff is there and your dad's there and the dog's there and everything that's familiar to you is there, and then you come back, I don't know, weeks later
and... nothing's there, nobody's there.
# Don't look for me #
NINA:
I decided that I wanted to go to Africa to live and never come back to America.
I got a divorce from Andy and I went to Liberia... and I moved there to stay.
When I got to Africa, I am happy, I'm beyond happy.
Liberia is a place that was founded by the American slaves, and it only makes sense that I should feel at home there.
I wore...
Bikinis and boots is all I wore.
WOMAN:
Yeah.
NINA:
Well, there was no loneliness.
There was no boredom.
The days flew into nights, and you just couldn't keep up with the times 'cause there was so much to do.
It was always fun.
I also am keenly aware that I've entered a world that I dreamed of all my life and that it is a perfect world.
And I remember thinking of the United States as something that I had had in a dream sometime in my life, but is now gone, like it never existed!
It was a dream that I had had and I had worked myself out of it 'cause I had toiled so long in that place, in that prison... and now I'm home, now I'm free,
and there is no going back.
There, it was vast and open, and everything was natural.
Everything!
I have seen lightning in Africa not flash, but hover, and what it does is it electrifies you into complete speechlessness.
I have seen it!
I have seen God.
LISA:
In my seventh grade year, Mom moved me to Liberia, but she was always traveling, and I never knew half the time if I wasn't going, that she was leaving or when she was coming back.
So I lived with a family for a year and I went to school there, and I lived with them until Mom came and decided to buy a house on the beach, and I went from living with them to living with her,
and she just...
I could never do anything right.
She went from being my comfort to the monster in my life.
Now she was the person that was doing the beating, and she was beating me.
One time, we were in public somewhere, I did something, and she just... she went off on me in front of everybody, and I didn't show any emotion because when Mom...
when Mom would see you cry, she knew she could push your buttons.
That's what she wanted, and I would not give her that satisfaction.
When she would hit me, I would look her dead in her face... and she'd be like, "You better cry.
You better cry."
I wouldn't do it.
Times got really bad, to the point where I thought about committing suicide.
So, when I was 14, I flew to New York, and I wound up living with my dad and I never went back.
ANDY:
After we broke up, a lot of things happened.
She didn't file taxes.
She didn't take care of business.
She lost the house in Mount Vernon.
Everything went crazy.
ROGER:
She lived a nomadic life, having no manager, having no husband... but she always said living in Africa was the happiest time in her life.
She could just be there, enjoy herself.
She didn't have to sing at all.
LISA:
She wasn't playing piano and she wasn't performing.
She said she hated the piano.
She hated it.
Think about it.
She's playing since she was four years old.
ROGER:
On the other hand, she was very well aware that in Africa, no money came in.
So she had to pick up her career again.
She didn't want to return to what she called,
"The United Snakes of America."
So she moved to Switzerland, which was the complete opposite of Africa, and the first thing she did was the Montreux concert.
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
You on yet?
Do you hear all those noises?
You didn't forget me, huh?
That's...
That's what's so wild, you didn't forget me.
I didn't expect you to, but I'm tired.
You don't know what I mean.
And there are many people in show business who said,
"Oh, she...
You know, she used to be a star.
She's gone all the way to the bottom,"
and all kinds of crap which means nothing to me at all.
I hope that you will see me or see the spirit in another sphere, on another plane very soon now.
And again, I don't wanna let you down and I get this feeling.
So I think the only way to tell you who I am these days... is to sing a song by Janis Ian.
# Stars, they come and go #
# They come fast, they come slow #
# They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze #
Hey, girl, sit down!
Sit down!

# Stars, they come and go #
# They come fast, they come slow #
# They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze #
# All you see is glory #
# But it gets lonely there when there's no one there to share #
# You can shake it away #
# If you'll hear a story #
# People lust for fame #
# Like athletes in a game #
# They break their collarbones and come up swinging #
# Some of them are crowned #
# Some of them are downed #
# Some are lost and never found #
# But most have seen it all #
# They live their lives in sad cafés and music halls #
# And they always have a story #
# Some make it when they're young #
# Before the world has done its dirty job #
# And later on someone will say, "You've had your day #
# Now you must make way" #
# Don't they always?
#
# But you'll never know the pain #
# Of using a name you never owned #
# The years of forgetting what you know too well #
# That you who gave the crown have been let down #
# You try to make amends #
# Without defending #
# Perhaps #
# Pretending you never saw the eyes #
NINA:
In Switzerland, there I had no money.
I never got anything from Andy.
He just cut himself off from me and I was left high and dry.
So I left Switzerland and I went to Paris, thinking that I could resume my career.
I did it alone and I landed in the wrong place.
I was working every night in a small cafe for about $300 a night.
[STAMMERING]
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
No, we just do "Vous Etes Seuls."
It goes like this!
[SINGING "VOUS ÊTES SEUL, MAIS JE DÉSIRE ÊTRE AVEC VOUS"]
NINA:
I was desperate and no one believed that I was there.
I was too big to be there.
No one came to see me.
And I had fallen from grace.
I'm sorry that I didn't become the world's first black classic pianist.
I think I would have been happier.
I'm not very happy now.
I wouldn't change being part of the civil rights movement.
I wouldn't change that.
But some of the songs that I sang have hurt my career.
All of the controversial songs the industry decided to punish me for... and they put a boycott on all of my records, and it's, uh... hard for me to incorporate those songs anymore because they are not relevant to the times.
In terms of the civil rights movement, how far have we come?
There aren't any civil rights!
What do you mean?
There is no reason to sing those songs.
Nothing is happening.
There's no civil rights movement.
Everybody's gone.
GERRIT DE BRUIN:
I met Nina in 1967 and I've been her friend all her life.
She called me in 1982 and she was here in Paris, living in a very small apartment, hardly with any money.
She did concerts of four hours long at Trois Mailletz, that nightclub, and she got a few hundred dollars a night.
And that was the worst period.
I visited her in that little apartment and it was so dirty, so I cleaned it all up and, "Nina, you can't live like this,"
but at that moment, she was still uncontrollable.
This thing in the Grand Hotel in Paris happened.
Somebody looked her in the eyes a bit too long, and she was already a bit nervous and she kind of... made a movement and I thought, "She's going to hit him."
Immediately, my arms around her, and I dragged her out in a taxi and I said to the taxi driver, "Drive!"
AL:
When I saw her in Paris, she was like a street urchin dressed in rags.
I couldn't believe what was happening and I was really, really sad.
Gerrit and I, we knew something was very wrong, and we were trying to figure out, and like, "What is it?
What is it, really?"
So Gerrit found her a condo in Nijmegen in Holland, and Gerrit had a friend, a doctor, that he brought to Nina's place, and the doctor examined her and asked her questions, and he prescribed a medication
which was kind of new... new spectrum, called Trilafon.
LISA:
It wasn't till I was in my 20s and I went to visit her in Nijmegen, that's when I learned the term "manic-depressive" and "bipolar"
and I remember asking,
"Well, what is that?
What do you mean by that?"
And her mood swings and a lot of the things I dealt with earlier in life when, you know, one minute she'd be happy and then the next minute...
I'd be dealing with someone that wasn't in the room five minutes ago.
It started to make sense.
GERRIT:
She got so deep in the shit in the end that she realized it's either dying or give in.
And she gave in because we said, "Nina... we'll get you a house, we'll get you your musicians, we'll make the things all right around you, we'll book your concerts... but you have to do as we say.
You have to take your medicine.
You have to work.
God has given you the possibility to be able to do what you do, so do it!
The only thing we want to hear is either 'yes' or 'no.'"
And she said, with tears in her eyes, "Yes."
LISA:
When I saw her,
I was very concerned because she had a... a nervous tic.
You know, she'd be talking or sitting and this...
Her mouth would always be twitching, and when she would walk, it was more of a shuffle.
And I'm like, "What's going on here?"
You know, "Why...
What's going on?
What am I missing?"
And they had her on medication.
AL:
She started taking the Trilafon and the doctor said,
"Through the years, it's going to have an effect on her motor skills.
Her voice is going to start to slur and her piano abilities will decline.
You can deal with that or you can deal with her probably damaging herself or someone else."
But the Trilafon really helped.
I mean, there were times in Holland, sitting on her terrace in these lounge chairs and just holding hands...
I mean, she was like...
She was my sister.
...and not talking at all for hours, just enjoying the day.
LISA:
And I suppose that medication enabled her to perform and fulfill the business dealings that were taking place so that her career could get back on track, but there were times when I questioned that, you know, "But what about her heart?"
Because at the end of the day, you guys got wives and husbands and lives, but she's alone.
NINA:
My personal life is a shambles.
I've had a few love affairs and I would love to be married, but everything has had to be sacrificed for the music.
[CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING]
GERRIT:
We had to do, first in Holland, eight concerts, and the word spread that Nina's doing the job well.
Then she was on the road again and it was... poof.
The business was going.
ROGER:
She came onstage and you had this overwhelming, emotional feeling coming from the audience just because she was there.
Now listen to me.
I love you very much.
I think you know that and I know that you love me.
- I know that.
- [AUDIENCE MEMBER WHOOPS]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ROGER:
And we never knew too well what was going to happen and how the mood would be.
So this place is very hot and it's very crowded and it's very ugly.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
ROGER:
But she opened her heart and soul at that moment.
That's this special kind of connection she had with an audience.
This song is popular all over France.
It's from our first album... the very first album we made in this world, which is at least 25 years old.
I only wish I was as wise... could have been as wise then as I have become now.
I have suffered.
But there's a Bösendorfer here, so we'll see what happens.
"My Baby Just Cares For Me."
She was helped by "My Baby Just Cares For Me,"
that song that became a hit because of the Chanel advertisement.
NINA:
And when "My Baby Just Cares For Me" came along, I said,
"I have to take this opportunity now to go all over the world because this is my last chance."
And so I worked very hard to take advantage of my second coming because it was my last time as far as I was concerned.
# My baby don't care for clothes #
# My baby don't care for shows #

# My baby don't care for... # # cars and races #
# My baby don't care for... # # high-tone places #
# Liz Taylor is not his style #
# And even Sally Burton's smile #
LISA:
And she was happiest doing music.
I think that was her salvation.
That's the one thing that she didn't have to think about.
When she sat at the piano, her fingers could fly.
# My baby don't care who knows it #
# My baby just cares for me #
She was an anomaly.
She was a genius.
She was brilliant, and that brilliance shone through no matter what she was going through.
Even into her old age, she was brilliant.
# My baby don't care for clothes #
# My baby don't care for shows #
GERRIT:
She was genius.
She could do whatever she liked.
And when she didn't have her medicine, she, musically, could get even further out.
# My baby don't care for... # # high-tone places #
In one of those little concerts, and it's recorded, she starts playing one song and she sings another.
And this recording, I made Miles Davis... while we were on tour, we were on the same jazz tour as Miles Davis, and I made him listen to it, and he said, "Gerrit...
let me listen to it again!
How is she doing this?"
He couldn't understand.
# My baby just cares for me #
SHABAZZ:
As I got older, I started to look at her and I thought to myself,
"Wow, she's from another time!"
But she was not at odds with the times.
The times was at odds with her.
I think when a person moves to their own kind of clock, spirit, flow, if we were living in an environment that allowed us to be exactly who we are, you're always in congress with yourself.
The challenge is,
"How do we fit in in the world that we're around, but we...
Are we allowed to be exactly who we are?
Was Nina Simone allowed to be exactly who she was?"
As fragile as she was strong, as vulnerable as she was dynamic, she was African royalty.
How does royalty stomp around in the mud and still walk with grace?
Most people are afraid to be as honest as she lived.

Good night!

[SONG ENDS]
Previously on Switched at Birth...
People are calling you la malinche.
Cortes' whore?
What happens when your landlords double our rent?
I pulled out of East Riverside.
- I'm Iris.
- Daphne.
I'm in the interpreter program.
Do you know a guy named Robbie?
Yes, I know who you're talking about.
Is there somewhere I can leave this for him?
Why don't I just give it to him?
Didn't I make it clear that I'm with him?
Stay away from him.
You didn't know that the turkey sandwich that you so stupidly handed over to an inmate had a bag of heroin stuffed inside it?
Oh my God.
You just became an accessory to a felony drug deal.
Professor Marillo, I heard that your "Chemistry 1" class was filled, and I was hoping to persuade you to let me in.
You have an interpreter?
We go 90 miles an hour.
Get someone who knows what the hell they're talking about, or you will drown.
Josh, this is my roommate Daphne.
I have a proposition for you.
We will text constantly.
_
It's the right decision.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
- Hey.
Hey, good morning.
- No, it's not.
- I have class in 10 minutes.
- What happened?
I wanted to get a full eight hours before my first chem class, and I took a sleeping pill.
It completely knocked me out.
I think I turned off my alarm and went back to sleep.
I'm sorry.
Can I help?
No.
I'll see you later.
_
_
_
Are you going to the gym?
Uh, I don't understand.
I wouldn't come to teach wearing sweatpants.
I ask for the same respect from you.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Might be a good time to go over my other rules.
No phones.
No food.
No drink.
No gum.
Ugh, hate gum.
Hate it.
This is 90 minutes for chemistry, and this material takes a lot of focus.
Coming late, texting,
- _ - eating... all of that takes away concentration from the other students.
Mr. Padden, you're back.
I'm not in the class.
Just interpreting.
You know sign language?
My parents are deaf.
Well, whatever language you use, let's try to keep it civil, shall we?
- Office hours are - _
- _
- Tuesday, Thursday, noon to 2:00,
- _ - sciences building.
- _
- Now, technically I'm there to answer any questions about the week's material,
- _ - but if you want to come and talk to me about...
- _
- French bulldogs,
- _ - or Claude Debussy, or the science of love...
- which just happens to have been my PhD thesis topic, - _
- _ - great topic...
I'm very happy to talk about any of that.
If the hours don't work for you,
- _ - let me know.
We will work something out.
Any questions so far?
_
So, do you want some breakfast?
Oh, thanks, but I should get Bay to her gig on time.
- Oh.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- There's our little community servant.
You ready to go?
- You're driving me?
- Yeah.
The corrections office is on my way to KD.
Oh, um...
Dad could drive me.
Right, dad?
Why?
The drop off is not at the corrections office today.
It's in East Riverside.
I didn't think you'd want to go.
It's been months.
I'll be fine.
Here you go, honey.
Have a good day and don't take anything from strangers.
Actually, because of someone, we're not allowed to bring lunch anymore.
They're feeding us.
- Thanks anyway.
- Oh.
Thank you.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Hey, you know what?
We should have lunch at the club.
That movie producer is coming over for coffee, and I have to get things ready, so...
Batter Up, the movie, coming soon to a theater near you.
Actually, he emailed me this morning, and he was wondering if you were gonna be here.
He wants to meet you.
Really?
Why?
Why do people always want to meet John Kennish?
All right, I'll dust off a war story or two.
Like that'll be hard to do.
History tells me that one-third of you will fail.
Of the remaining two-thirds, few of you will make above a "C."
- _
- At least one of you is going to cry at some point during this class.
- _
- Oh, and several of you
- _ - will have a grandmother die the night before
- _ - or the morning of the midterm.
- _
- You have my condolences in advance,
- _ - but no, you will not be
- exempt from taking the exam.
- _
- I don't believe in excuses, - _
- _ - or leniency, or wiggle room.
- Chemistry...
- _
- It is an exact...
- _
- Excuse me?
- ...
Science governed by laws and rules.
It's just really distracting.
I like to think I run this class with similar clarity...
Are you sure this is it?
In the alley around back.
Bye.
Ooh.
Damn it.
Hello?
Hi, I'm looking for the owner of the motorcycle parked out front.
Great.
I'm sorry.
Is it yours?
I...
Sort of tapped it.
Looks like more than a tap.
I...
I have insurance.
Still not what I need right now.
You can write down your info here.
Of course.
Well, at least you didn't keep going.
That would be a hit and run.
Only if you got caught.
This place yours?
I've never seen it before.
It was a boot and shoe place.
Right.
- You live around here?
- I used to.
I got this place on the cheap about six weeks ago.
- Lucky you.
- Yeah.
I guess some big, new development was supposed to go up across the street, but it tanked, taking the property values down with it.
I think I heard something about that.
Is that machine working?
Can I get a cup of coffee?
Sure.
I like the name,
"Cracked Mug."
It feels right for this neighborhood.
Cracked but still here.
Yeah, just like me.
Me too.
So, have you owned other coffeehouses before?
No, not coffeehouses, but other businesses.
And I have a lot of opinions about coffee.
Like... ?
Well, everyone's very particular about the kind of mug they want their coffee in.
Some people like it tall and skinny to keep it hot.
Other people like it short and big to wrap their hands around.
Some people like handles.
Other people like the little Chinese cups.
I wanted a place where you could request the kind of mug you want.
- That's cool.
- Yeah.
I was thinking of putting a chess and checkers set over in one corner.
Oh, dominoes too.
The old folks around here love to play dominoes.
Thanks.
I, um... don't know my license plate number by heart.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.
- 'Kay.
Listen up, I got an announcement.
Because of a recent incident...
Today there's some new rules.
No fraternizing with outsiders.
If I see you talking to anyone I don't know, you're getting a write-up.
No going to the bathroom by yourself.
You need to go?
See me.
Last thing.
No phones.
Not even at lunch.
Turn 'em off, and put them in this bucket.
Now.
What was he talking about?
What incident?
I thought you knew.
That sandwich I gave Robbie the last time...
There were drugs in it.
What?
- Yeah.
- Oh my God.
Oh my... that's why he's not here?
- His sister dropped it off.
- He doesn't have a sister.
Brunette, blue car?
That's Annie, his ex.
I knew he was still in touch with that little whore.
I'm so sorry, Tess.
She told me that she was his sister,
- and that her name was Marcy.
- And you believed her?
Do you know how bad you just screwed things up for me?
Phones in the bucket.
Robbie got busted with contraband?
That's the word.
But he's still getting out in a month, right?
Not my area,
- but I doubt it.
- We were gonna move in together.
I put a deposit down on a place.
I'd make a different plan if I were you.
On the other hand, one more write up and you'll be behind bars too.
That's kind of like living together.
Phones.
Again, I am really sorry.
These are brownies and scones, and I also make pan dulce, if your customers prefer that.
Well, I'm not sure how much food we're gonna carry, but I can get back to you.
Well...
Thank you so much.
Juanita.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm just here for coffee.
I can't believe you have the nerve to show your face.
I wasn't the one who pulled the plug on the project.
No, your boyfriend did, after he cheated everyone out of a fair price for their businesses.
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Do you think things were bad before?
They are a lot worse now.
I'm asking this man if he will buy my brownies.
I am so sorry.
- When the project folded, I lost too.
- Oh, please.
Look at you with your fancy purse and your fancy jacket!
What did you lose?
- Juanita, yelling at me...
- Go to hell!
Malinche.
Well, I just figured out who you are.
Sorry about that.
You all done writing down your info?
Yeah.
And you can take this...
To go.
Look, I don't know all the facts, but I'm trying to start a business here.
And as a guy from the outside,
I'm already suspect.
I can't afford to start out on the wrong foot.
Got it.
And then same thing...
If you add an "o5,"
you get "h2-c2-o5,"
or peroxalic acid.
Okay, you know what?
Let's just stop there.
Congratulations, you survived your first class.
Nobody fainted, nobody lost their organic granola breakfast.
Come on, give yourselves a hand.
Very good.
Get out of here.
Oh, I advise forming study groups of four.
That will keep you honest, okay?
See you tomorrow.
Hey, you guys look smart.
Can I be in your group?
- Yes.
- Yeah, that'd be awesome
- do you know anyone here?
- No.
Do you want me to ask if...
No, I got it.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Daphne.
Vimla.
- Is this your study group?
- Mm-hmm.
It looks like you need one more.
Can I be your fourth?
Sure.
Um, if it's okay with you guys.
- Of course.
- Yeah, why not.
Thanks so much.
Of course we'll have the ball players, and the groupies, and the sex-capades.
Those are just the fireworks, but it all needs to be grounded in something personal, emotional.
Well, to me, it's a story of a woman who loses her innocence.
That is exactly what I was going to say.
Good, I'm glad you agree.
So just make sure you don't lose sight of that when you're writing the screenplay.
Um... wait.
You want me to write the screenplay?
I mean, you know I've never written one before, right?
So what?
Don't you want someone with more of a track record?
I mean...
Let me ask you something.
When you were writing the book, did you see the story as...
Pictures in your mind?
Oh, yeah, of course I did.
Well, then you've already written it.
The rest is just a format.
Any valet parker in L.A. can teach you that.
We'll hire one, a few bucks a week, as your assistant, boom.
Instant screenplay.
Boom.
- Who pays for that?
- Oh.
Production.
Comes right out of the budget, which, for a film like this, is about $6 million, and I've got four of it lined up already.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's my editor.
I told her I was meeting with you, and I just want to tell her that she might be talking to a new screenwriter.
Let her know you got a hit here!
And I do believe that.
I would not have flown all the way out here from L.A.
to meet with the two of you if I didn't.
Thank you.
It's...
I had nothing to do with it.
It's all Kathryn.
But you do believe that her book would make a great movie, yes?
- Absolutely.
- Great.
Good, I'm glad you think so.
Because this film... it can be your success, too.
Really?
Hey.
- Leave me alone.
- Look.
I said I was sorry.
Does that help me?
Let me make it up to you.
How?
Can you get in a time machine, go back, and stay the hell away from Robbie like I told you to in the first place?
I wish that I had.
I'm screwed here, too.
My boyfriend's in California, and he's probably calling me right now, and I can't answer
- because my phone's...
- You can't talk to your boyfriend?
I am this close to losing my kid to foster care...
- I know you have it way worse.
- Hey!
... and you can't talk to your boyfriend?
Hey, hey, hey!
What is it with you two?
I told you to cut out the bickering.
I was just sitting here.
She started in on me.
I did not start in on you.
Eh, eh, eh.
Come with me.
I know how to make everyone happy.
What's that smell?
My guess is a dead rat.
I don't think this is safe.
That's what these are for.
Now...
When you find the jackpot, bag it, put it with the rest of the garbage.
I thought you said this was gonna make everyone happy?
Oops, I meant it was going to make me happy.
This is not fair.
I was minding my own business.
Give me a reason, Tess.
You think I give a rat's ass that you have a kid waiting for you back at whatever pit you crawled out of?
I don't.
I wouldn't think twice about writing you up and getting you locked up like Robbie, just so I don't have to look at you anymore.
So give me a reason.
Now what do you have to say?
Hey, I left some mail for you that somehow landed in our box.
Thanks.
You're home early.
Yeah, I never made it in.
Why's that?
Uh, when I... dropped Bay off in East Riverside I got ambushed by somebody pretty pissed off at me for what happened with the development.
Regina, people get emotional.
You gotta take their griping with a grain of salt.
I know.
It just...
It made me sad all over again.
I wanted to do something good for the neighborhood.
I know you did.
Anyway, I mean... after getting yelled at like that,
I didn't want to go to KD and stare at tasteful, beige wallpaper samples.
Sounds like an honest day's work to me, and I would imagine that customer will not be calling you with death threats.
Look, it's just my opinion, but I think you should steer clear of that neighborhood for the time being.
Yeah.
I think I found it.
Is it a rat?
How do I know?
It's in there.
I see something, but I don't think we can reach it.
You're gonna have to crawl in there and get it.
Me?
Hah, no.
You can do it.
It's your fault we're here in the first place.
You were arguing too.
You got Robbie in trouble.
I gave him his lunch!
- I'm not going in there.
- Listen to me.
You owe me.
You said you wanted to make it up to me.
Here's your chance.
Do it.
Hey.
Don't forget these.
_
_
Hey, hey!
Felonious B. Kennish.
What are you doing here?
Oh, your brother had some D.J. emergency.
Now come on, I had to park a block away.
What's that smell?
- You don't want to know.
- Hmm.
Bad day?
The only kind I have right now.
What happened?
I tried to do something nice, and I ended up getting on the wrong side of this Godzilla, who now has it out for me.
Ooh, is she fire-breathing?
I don't know, but she's definitely out for blood.
You just got to stand up to her.
How?
Take her on.
If she's Godzilla, you gotta be Ghidorah.
- Who?
- It's Godzilla's Nemesis.
Look, when you show up for work tomorrow, go up to her, and just start whaling on her.
- Tank!
- What?
Prison rules.
Haven't you seen Escape From Alcatraz?
I'm not in prison, and I'm not gonna go up and whale on anybody.
Do you remember who I am?
Yes, do you remember what I taught you in field hockey?
No.
Okay.
All right, look.
You gotta face the ball with fury.
- Come on, let's see it.
- What else you got?
Um...
How about a peace offering?
Yeah, tried that, didn't work.
Well, can you ask to transfer to another work crew?
That's not an option.
Well...
Look, you gotta find some way to show her you're not gonna back down, or every day is gonna be like this.
The metal loses electrons to become a cation, and the nonmetal gains electrons to become an anion.
- Cat is the positive one, right?
- Wait, are you sure?
Yeah, and the resulting compound name ends in "ide,"
like magnesium bromide.
- Wait, what was that?
- Magnesium bromide.
It's just an example of an ionic compound.
I wanna what?
Time out.
Guys, I can't interpret for all three of you at the same time.
If we could just slow down a little bit.
- Slow down?
We need to go faster.
- Sorry.
It's just, we're slogging through this, and we still have another chapter to cover.
You know what?
Why don't we just call it for tonight, and we can review the rest on our own.
No, no.
We don't need to stop.
I just need a moment to catch up.
The more people that are talking at once, the harder it is to follow.
I'll get better at it.
Josh will, too.
Don't worry about it.
I'll see you in class.
You know, honey, I thought that producer was just gonna wanna talk about the sex scenes, but he surprised me.
He wants to give the characters more depth.
We are totally in sync.
You didn't like him, did you?
You know, I thought he was a little slick.
I think you can do better.
Better?
How?
He's the only serious interest I've had in the movie rights.
Well, you don't have to pick him just 'cause he's the only one who asked.
I see.
What?
Forget it.
Kathryn!
You're used to getting all the attention.
Ex-major league ball player, and all he wanted to do was talk about my book.
Admit it.
Your ego is a little bruised.
Right?
Come on.
He was fishing for money.
He needs to raise $6 million to make the movie.
He said he had all the money lined up.
Yeah, he was bluffing.
When you took the call, he hit me up for a million, and asked if I knew any other retired ballplayers who might be interested.
Does he...
Even want to make the movie?
If I finance it, yeah.
I see.
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna get some air.
That was a disaster.
I can't be unprepared like that again.
Why are you acting like that was my fault?
We need to come up with signs so you don't have to fingerspell everything.
There are a lot of words!
We'll start with the common elements of the periodic table.
What's going on?
Oh.
Didn't you get my text?
I texted everyone.
There was no text.
I don't understand.
They're meeting without you.
Look, it's not personal.
Hmm.
'Cause dumping someone never is.
We just have to go at a different pace.
We think maybe you'd be better off in a different group.
I'm sorry that I was so...
Why are you sorry?
They should be sorry.
What?
They can't take the extra three minutes it would take to let us catch up?
- Josh, I got this.
- You guys are training to be doctors, right?
To heal people who are sick?
You guys are douchebags.
- Stop.
- Did you know that?
- Total douchebags.
- Stop!
What the hell was that?
I was expressing my opinion.
You don't have an opinion.
You're an interpreter.
You don't have a voice.
You don't have a presence.
You don't have opinions.
I'm not gonna just stand there and take that from those...
Your job is to interpret what I can't hear, not to speak for me, not to think for me, not to defend me, and not to piss off my classmates.
Well, I can't do that.
I can't just stand there like a robot.
Well, then you're fired.
What?
Fine.
Feeling better?
A little.
I just feel silly for getting my hopes up.
You never know.
A movie version of your book could still happen.
No, that guy was the only halfway-legitimate contender.
Besides, it would have made a bad movie, anyway.
It would have been a great movie if it were done right.
But you know Hollywood, they'd put Kate Hudson in it and that smarmy Jim guy from The Office and ruin it.
I like him.
You should have Lydia take it to Broadway.
They could make a musical out of it.
Oh, yeah, right.
At least there'd be some dancing in it.
Pa, pa-pa, pa-pa, pow!
There could be like a whole chorus line of shirtless ballboys.
Yes, please!
♪ Oh, say, what do you see?
♪
♪ Those balls don't look foul to me ♪
♪ come on, boys, raise those mitts ♪
♪ touch those bases, get some hits ♪
♪ put your ball in my glove, it's a home run ♪
♪ this is love ♪
Yeah!
See?
It writes itself.
_
- _
- Is that all you're eating?
I'm not really hungry.
- _
- All right.
How's Emmett?
Fine.
Bay?
_
- Bay!
- Hmm?
Do you mind looking at me when I'm talking to you?
I'm sorry.
Emmett's going into a screening, and he's not gonna be able to use his phone.
I'm not sure how healthy all this constant texting is.
Dad, I had to beg him to go to L.A. without me, and he still could change his mind at any minute.
If he could make it through a couple weeks, make some friends, then he'll be okay.
But until then...
I have to make him believe that it's not a big deal we're so far away from each other.
Okay.
Please tell him we send our best.
_
_
_
_
You fired him?
So, who's gonna interpret for you?
No one.
There's no one else.
I just have to do it myself.
I need to get better at lip-reading chemistry words.
Can you help me practice?
Sure.
I highlighted a bunch of words that I need to recognize.
Just read them and jump around.
Okay.
Coefficient.
Coefficient.
Polyatomic.
Polyatomic.
Pick a hard one and don't over enunciate, 'cause she won't.
Halogenated.
Halogenated.
How long do you need it?
It's a type of unsaturated hydrocarbon.
Try again.
Enthalpies.
It looks like you're saying,
"end of peace," but I know that's wrong.
It just takes practice.
Pick another word.
What's the 911?
All right, this might seem a little crazy, but...
The musical!
Yes!
I couldn't sleep all night.
I kept seeing dance numbers in my head, and writing lyrics to songs.
Didn't I tell you?
I'm a genius.
But that's the thing.
You're right.
This would make a good musical, but I've never written one before.
So?
You'd never written a book before, and now you've written two.
That's true.
You know, we should do it.
Whoa, "we"?
Yes, you're the one that got the ball rolling.
No, no, no.
That's all I'm good for... the big picture, not the details.
Like, I could tell Ricardo that his guest bath needed a new look, but I couldn't tell him which tile to buy.
It's your idea.
You run with it.
Okay, but...
Will you come to see it, even if nobody else does?
Are you kidding?
I'll be leading the standing ovation.
But first, let's cast that chorus line of shirtless ballboys.
I thought I fired you.
Didn't stick.
Did Iris call you?
That was nice of her, but...
This isn't working out.
Here's the thing.
Hearing kid, deaf parents.
I was their ears and voice starting at age five.
If the cleaners ruined my dad's shirt, or if my mom's soup was too salty...
You had to fight their battles.
It wasn't all bad.
In fourth grade, the interpreter didn't show up, so I had to interpret my own parent-teacher conference.
I bet your behavior was perfect.
She said
I was doing excellent in every arena.
All this to say... someone like you, an empowered deafie... it's a new thing for me.
I just have to get used to it.
I need you, but I can't have you talking for me.
Ears only.
Got it.
So...
I stopped by the chemistry department and... got the notes for the next class.
You get advanced notes?
Yeah.
Hey, let me use your phone.
I'm waiting for a call.
What's wrong with yours?
It's out of minutes.
- It's important.
- So is the call that I'm waiting for.
What, your boyfriend?
I have to call Robbie's lawyer about getting him out.
You remember Robbie, the guy who got busted because of you.
You can borrow it as soon as I'm done with my call.
Lunch will be over by then.
You owe me.
Hey!
No, that is my phone.
Give me the friggin' phone!
There's your phone.
You psycho!
I do not owe you anything.
That guy got busted because he is a drug dealer.
That is on him, not me.
I told you messing with me was a mistake.
Do whatever you want.
I already can't go to L.A. to be with my boyfriend for a whole year.
I got nothing else to lose.
Hey.
Hey!
What the hell is going on?
What's the problem here, Tess?
Did she do that?
No, I dropped it.
All right. 15 minutes and we're back to work.
Not my bike again.
I want you to know
I got involved with the development project for all the right reasons.
You don't owe me an explanation.
You took Juanita's word about what happened and threw me out.
Threw you out is an overstatement.
I grew up in this neighborhood.
I saw a chance to do something good for it, and I took it.
But I got in over my head, and I made mistakes.
I still think I could do something good.
Let me help you with your coffeehouse.
Help how?
I'm an interior designer.
I can give your place the look you want to get it open.
Uh, I don't think that would be a smart move for me right now.
_
I can hire someone who speaks Spanish.
But I grew up here.
I know these people.
Yeah, and they don't like you, and they don't trust you.
They used to, and I can win them back.
What does that have to do with me and my coffeehouse?
Well, this is how I get them back on my side.
And in exchange, I can bring money to help you get this place up and running.
Things are always more expensive than they say at first.
Well, I did get an estimate on bringing the plumbing up to code.
You wanna draw people in?
Make this a neighborhood hangout?
We could make part of the space an art gallery for local artists, or once a week we can do an open mic night.
There are some really talented people in this neighborhood.
We can sell Juanita's brownies, but also carry healthy snacks so that parents have options when they bring their kids.
We don't even know each other.
I'm Regina.
Regina Vasquez.
Also known as la malinche.
What is malinche anyway?
A traitorous whore.
Damn.
Yeah.
Eric.
Eric Bishop.
Whoo, Jimmy.
Looks like you hit the jackpot.
All right, we got another dead rat, and this one's ripe.
Who's gonna do the honors?
Who's a team player?
Come on.
It's not getting any fresher.
She's not supposed to do that.
What'd you say?
We're not supposed to touch dead animals.
You're supposed to call animal control.
Says who?
There's a lawsuit against the county about it.
I mean, if you don't care about that...
All right.
Somebody give me some tongs.
I'll do it.
Thank you.
It's no big deal.
Okay.
Gentle.
Just around the corner.
Right over here.
This is perfect.
There you go.
Ah.
Did I miss something?
I bought a piano.
_
_
_
_
_
Uh, what about lanthanides?
Um...
- That?
- Yeah.
Okay.
About yesterday... maybe we could have handled it better.
We'd like to have you back in the group.
You mean me and my advanced notes.
They'd be helpful.
We'd be helping each other out.
I need you to slow down and speak clearly, so that I can follow the discussion.
Either I or Josh will let you know when you're going too fast.
Agreed.
We're meeting at 7:00 tonight, the chem classroom.
We'll be there.
- Well played.
- Thanks.
Previously on Switched at Birth...
People are calling you la malinche.
Cortes' whore?
What happens when your landlords double our rent?
I pulled out of East Riverside.
- I'm Iris.
- Daphne.
I'm in the interpreter program.
Do you know a guy named Robbie?
Yes, I know who you're talking about.
Is there somewhere I can leave this for him?
Why don't I just give it to him?
Didn't I make it clear that I'm with him?
Stay away from him.
You didn't know that the turkey sandwich that you so stupidly handed over to an inmate had a bag of heroin stuffed inside it?
Oh my God.
You just became an accessory to a felony drug deal.
Professor Marillo, I heard that your "Chemistry 1" class was filled, and I was hoping to persuade you to let me in.
You have an interpreter?
We go 90 miles an hour.
Get someone who knows what the hell they're talking about, or you will drown.
Josh, this is my roommate Daphne.
I have a proposition for you.
We will text constantly.

- Hey.
Hey, good morning.
- No, it's not.
- I have class in 10 minutes.
- What happened?
I wanted to get a full eight hours before my first chem class, and I took a sleeping pill.
- Uh-oh.
- It completely knocked me out.
I think I turned off my alarm and went back to sleep.
I'm sorry.
Can I help?
No.
I'll see you later.
(Rock music playing)
(Door slams)
_
_
_
Are you going to the gym?
Uh, I don't understand.
I wouldn't come to teach wearing sweatpants.
I ask for the same respect from you.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Might be a good time to go over my other rules.
No phones.
No food.
No drink.
No gum.
Ugh, hate gum.
Hate it.
This is 90 minutes for chemistry, and this material takes a lot of focus.
Coming late, texting,
- _ - eating... all of that takes away concentration from the other students.
Mr. Padden, you're back.
I'm not in the class.
Just interpreting.
You know sign language?
My parents are deaf.
Well, whatever language you use, let's try to keep it civil, shall we?
- Office hours are - _
- _
- Tuesday, Thursday, noon to 2:00,
- _ - sciences building.
- _
- Now, technically I'm there to answer any questions about the week's material,
- _ - but if you want to come and talk to me about...
- _
- French bulldogs,
- _ - or Claude Debussy, or the science of love...
- which just happens to have been my PhD thesis topic, - _
- _ - great topic...
I'm very happy to talk about any of that.
If the hours don't work for you,
- _ - let me know.
We will work something out.
Any questions so far?
_
(Theme music playing)
So, do you want some breakfast?
Oh, thanks, but I should get Bay to her gig on time.
- Oh.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- There's our little community servant.
You ready to go?
- You're driving me?
- Yeah.
The corrections office is on my way to KD.
Oh, um...
Dad could drive me.
Right, dad?
Regina:
Why?
The drop off is not at the corrections office today.
It's in East Riverside.
I didn't think you'd want to go.
(Sighs)
It's been months.
I'll be fine.
Here you go, honey.
Have a good day and don't take anything from strangers.
Actually, because of someone, we're not allowed to bring lunch anymore.
They're feeding us.
- Thanks anyway.
- Oh.
Thank you.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Hey, you know what?
We should have lunch at the club.
That movie producer is coming over for coffee, and I have to get things ready, so...
Batter Up, the movie, coming soon to a theater near you.
Actually, he emailed me this morning, and he was wondering if you were gonna be here.
He wants to meet you.
Really?
Why?
Why do people always want to meet John Kennish?
All right, I'll dust off a war story or two.
Like that'll be hard to do.
History tells me that one-third of you will fail.
Of the remaining two-thirds, few of you will make above a "C."
- _
- At least one of you is going to cry at some point during this class.
- _
- Oh, and several of you
- _ - will have a grandmother die the night before
- _ - or the morning of the midterm.
- _
- You have my condolences in advance,
- _ - but no, you will not be
- exempt from taking the exam.
- _
- I don't believe in excuses, - _
- _ - or leniency, or wiggle room.
- Chemistry...
- _
- It is an exact...
- (Claps) _
- Excuse me?
- ...
Science governed by laws and rules.
It's just really distracting.
I like to think I run this class with similar clarity...
Regina:
Are you sure this is it?
Bay:
In the alley around back.
Regina:
Bye.
Ooh.
Damn it.
(Sighs)
(Soft blues playing)
Hello?
Hi, I'm looking for the owner of the motorcycle parked out front.
(Sighs) Great.
I'm sorry.
Is it yours?
I...
Sort of tapped it.
Looks like more than a tap.
I...
I have insurance.
Still not what I need right now.
You can write down your info here.
Of course.
Well, at least you didn't keep going.
That would be a hit and run.
Only if you got caught.
This place yours?
I've never seen it before.
It was a boot and shoe place.
Right.
- You live around here?
- I used to.
I got this place on the cheap about six weeks ago.
- Lucky you.
- Yeah.
I guess some big, new development was supposed to go up across the street, but it tanked, taking the property values down with it.
I think I heard something about that.
Is that machine working?
Can I get a cup of coffee?
Sure.
I like the name,
"Cracked Mug."
It feels right for this neighborhood.
Cracked but still here.
Yeah, just like me.
Me too.
So, have you owned other coffeehouses before?
No, not coffeehouses, but other businesses.
And I have a lot of opinions about coffee.
Like... ?
Well, everyone's very particular about the kind of mug they want their coffee in.
Some people like it tall and skinny to keep it hot.
Other people like it short and big to wrap their hands around.
Some people like handles.
Other people like the little Chinese cups.
I wanted a place where you could request the kind of mug you want.
- That's cool.
- Yeah.
I was thinking of putting a chess and checkers set over in one corner.
Oh, dominoes too.
The old folks around here love to play dominoes.
Thanks.
I, um... don't know my license plate number by heart.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.
- 'Kay.
Man:
Listen up, I got an announcement.
Because of a recent incident...
Today there's some new rules.
No fraternizing with outsiders.
If I see you talking to anyone I don't know, you're getting a write-up.
No going to the bathroom by yourself.
You need to go?
See me.
Last thing.
No phones.
Not even at lunch.
Turn 'em off, and put them in this bucket.
Now.
What was he talking about?
What incident?
I thought you knew. (Chuckles)
That sandwich I gave Robbie the last time...
There were drugs in it.
What?
- Yeah.
- Oh my God.
Oh my... that's why he's not here?
- His sister dropped it off.
- He doesn't have a sister.
Brunette, blue car?
That's Annie, his ex.
I knew he was still in touch with that little whore.
I'm so sorry, Tess.
She told me that she was his sister,
- and that her name was Marcy.
- And you believed her?
Do you know how bad you just screwed things up for me?
Phones in the bucket.
Robbie got busted with contraband?
That's the word.
But he's still getting out in a month, right?
Not my area,
- but I doubt it.
- We were gonna move in together.
I put a deposit down on a place.
I'd make a different plan if I were you.
On the other hand, one more write up and you'll be behind bars too.
That's kind of like living together.
Phones.
Again, I am really sorry.
These are brownies and scones, and I also make pan dulce, if your customers prefer that.
Well, I'm not sure how much food we're gonna carry, but I can get back to you.
Well...
Thank you so much.
Juanita.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm just here for coffee.
(Scoffs) I can't believe you have the nerve to show your face.
I wasn't the one who pulled the plug on the project.
No, your boyfriend did, after he cheated everyone out of a fair price for their businesses.
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Do you think things were bad before?
They are a lot worse now.
I'm asking this man if he will buy my brownies.
I am so sorry.
- When the project folded, I lost too.
- Oh, please.
(Yelling) Look at you with your fancy purse and your fancy jacket!
What did you lose?
- Juanita, yelling at me...
- Go to hell!
Malinche.
Well, I just figured out who you are.
Sorry about that.
You all done writing down your info?
Yeah.
And you can take this...
To go.
Look, I don't know all the facts, but I'm trying to start a business here.
And as a guy from the outside,
I'm already suspect.
I can't afford to start out on the wrong foot.
Got it.
And then same thing...
If you add an "o5,"
you get "h2-c2-o5,"
or peroxalic acid.
Okay, you know what?
Let's just stop there.
Congratulations, you survived your first class.
Nobody fainted, nobody lost their organic granola breakfast.
- Come on, give yourselves a hand.
- (Applause)
Very good.
Get out of here.
Oh, I advise forming study groups of four.
That will keep you honest, okay?
See you tomorrow.
Hey, you guys look smart.
Can I be in your group?
- Yes.
- Yeah, that'd be awesome
- do you know anyone here?
- No.
Do you want me to ask if...
No, I got it.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Daphne.
Vimla.
- Is this your study group?
- Mm-hmm.
It looks like you need one more.
Can I be your fourth?
Sure.
Um, if it's okay with you guys.
- Of course.
- Yeah, why not.
Thanks so much.
Of course we'll have the ball players, and the groupies, and the sex-capades.
Those are just the fireworks, but it all needs to be grounded in something personal, emotional.
Well, to me, it's a story of a woman who loses her innocence.
That is exactly what I was going to say.
Good, I'm glad you agree.
So just make sure you don't lose sight of that when you're writing the screenplay.
Um... wait.
You want me to write the screenplay?
I mean, you know I've never written one before, right?
So what?
Don't you want someone with more of a track record?
I mean...
Let me ask you something.
When you were writing the book, did you see the story as...
Pictures in your mind?
Oh, yeah, of course I did.
Well, then you've already written it.
The rest is just a format.
Any valet parker in L.A. can teach you that.
We'll hire one, a few bucks a week, as your assistant, boom.
Instant screenplay.
(Chuckles) Boom.
- Who pays for that?
- Oh.
Production.
Comes right out of the budget, which, for a film like this, is about $6 million, and I've got four of it lined up already.
- (Gasps) - (Phone vibrates)
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's my editor.
I told her I was meeting with you, and I just want to tell her that she might be talking to a new screenwriter.
(Laughs)
Let her know you got a hit here!
(Laughs)
And I do believe that.
I would not have flown all the way out here from L.A.
to meet with the two of you if I didn't.
Thank you.
It's...
I had nothing to do with it.
It's all Kathryn.
But you do believe that her book would make a great movie, yes?
- Absolutely.
- Great.
Good, I'm glad you think so.
Because this film... it can be your success, too.
Really?
Hey.
- Leave me alone.
- Look.
I said I was sorry.
Does that help me?
Let me make it up to you.
How?
Can you get in a time machine, go back, and stay the hell away from Robbie like I told you to in the first place?
I wish that I had.
I'm screwed here, too.
My boyfriend's in California, and he's probably calling me right now, and I can't answer
- because my phone's...
- You can't talk to your boyfriend?
I am this close to losing my kid to foster care...
- I know you have it way worse.
- Gordon:
Hey!
... and you can't talk to your boyfriend?
Hey, hey, hey!
What is it with you two?
I told you to cut out the bickering.
I was just sitting here.
She started in on me.
I did not start in on you.
Eh, eh, eh.
Come with me.
I know how to make everyone happy.
What's that smell?
My guess is a dead rat.
I don't think this is safe.
That's what these are for.
Now...
When you find the jackpot, bag it, put it with the rest of the garbage.
I thought you said this was gonna make everyone happy?
Oops, I meant it was going to make me happy.
This is not fair.
I was minding my own business.
Give me a reason, Tess.
You think I give a rat's ass that you have a kid waiting for you back at whatever pit you crawled out of?
I don't.
I wouldn't think twice about writing you up and getting you locked up like Robbie, just so I don't have to look at you anymore.
So give me a reason.
Now what do you have to say?
Hey, I left some mail for you that somehow landed in our box.
Thanks.
You're home early.
Yeah, I never made it in.
Why's that?
Uh, when I... dropped Bay off in East Riverside I got ambushed by somebody pretty pissed off at me for what happened with the development.
Regina, people get emotional.
You gotta take their griping with a grain of salt.
I know.
It just...
It made me sad all over again.
I wanted to do something good for the neighborhood.
I know you did.
Anyway, I mean... after getting yelled at like that,
I didn't want to go to KD and stare at tasteful, beige wallpaper samples.
Sounds like an honest day's work to me, and I would imagine that customer will not be calling you with death threats.
Look, it's just my opinion, but I think you should steer clear of that neighborhood for the time being.
Yeah.
(Gags)
I think I found it.
Is it a rat?
How do I know?
It's in there.
I see something, but I don't think we can reach it.
You're gonna have to crawl in there and get it.
Me?
Hah, no.
You can do it.
It's your fault we're here in the first place.
You were arguing too.
You got Robbie in trouble.
I gave him his lunch!
- I'm not going in there.
- Listen to me.
You owe me.
You said you wanted to make it up to me.
Here's your chance.
Do it.
Hey.
Don't forget these.
(Groans)
_
_
Tank:
Hey, hey!
Felonious B. Kennish.
What are you doing here?
Oh, your brother had some D.J. emergency.
Now come on, I had to park a block away.
What's that smell?
- You don't want to know.
- Hmm.
Bad day?
The only kind I have right now.
What happened?
I tried to do something nice, and I ended up getting on the wrong side of this Godzilla, who now has it out for me.
Ooh, is she fire-breathing?
I don't know, but she's definitely out for blood.
You just got to stand up to her.
How?
Take her on.
If she's Godzilla, you gotta be Ghidorah.
- Who?
- It's Godzilla's Nemesis.
Look, when you show up for work tomorrow, go up to her, and just start whaling on her.
- Tank!
- What?
Prison rules.
Haven't you seen Escape From Alcatraz?
I'm not in prison, and I'm not gonna go up and whale on anybody.
Do you remember who I am?
Yes, do you remember what I taught you in field hockey?
No.
Okay.
All right, look.
You gotta face the ball with fury.
(Growls)
(Growls louder)
- Come on, let's see it.
- What else you got?
(Sighs) Um...
How about a peace offering?
Yeah, tried that, didn't work.
Well, can you ask to transfer to another work crew?
That's not an option.
(Sighs) Well...
Look, you gotta find some way to show her you're not gonna back down, or every day is gonna be like this.
The metal loses electrons to become a cation, and the nonmetal gains electrons to become an anion.
- Cat is the positive one, right?
- Wait, are you sure?
Yeah, and the resulting compound name ends in "ide,"
like magnesium bromide.
- Wait, what was that?
- Magnesium bromide.
It's just an example of an ionic compound.
I wanna what?
(Muffled speaking)
Time out.
Guys, I can't interpret for all three of you at the same time.
If we could just slow down a little bit.
- Slow down?
We need to go faster.
- Sorry.
It's just, we're slogging through this, and we still have another chapter to cover.
You know what?
Why don't we just call it for tonight, and we can review the rest on our own.
No, no.
We don't need to stop.
I just need a moment to catch up.
The more people that are talking at once, the harder it is to follow.
I'll get better at it.
Josh will, too.
Don't worry about it.
I'll see you in class.
(Sighs)
You know, honey, I thought that producer was just gonna wanna talk about the sex scenes, but he surprised me.
He wants to give the characters more depth.
We are totally in sync.
(Sighs) You didn't like him, did you?
You know, I thought he was a little slick.
I think you can do better.
Better?
How?
He's the only serious interest I've had in the movie rights.
Well, you don't have to pick him just 'cause he's the only one who asked.
I see.
What?
(Sighs) Forget it.
Kathryn!
You're used to getting all the attention.
Ex-major league ball player, and all he wanted to do was talk about my book.
Admit it.
Your ego is a little bruised.
Right?
(Chuckles) Come on.
He was fishing for money.
He needs to raise $6 million to make the movie.
He said he had all the money lined up.
Yeah, he was bluffing.
When you took the call, he hit me up for a million, and asked if I knew any other retired ballplayers who might be interested.
Does he...
Even want to make the movie?
If I finance it, yeah.
(Sighs)
I see.
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna get some air.
(Sighs)
That was a disaster.
I can't be unprepared like that again.
Why are you acting like that was my fault?
We need to come up with signs so you don't have to fingerspell everything.
There are a lot of words!
We'll start with the common elements of the periodic table.
(Chattering)
What's going on?
Oh. (Scoffs)
Didn't you get my text?
I texted everyone.
There was no text.
I don't understand.
They're meeting without you.
Look, it's not personal.
Hmm.
'Cause dumping someone never is.
We just have to go at a different pace.
We think maybe you'd be better off in a different group.
I'm sorry that I was so...
Why are you sorry?
They should be sorry.
What?
They can't take the extra three minutes it would take to let us catch up?
- Josh, I got this.
- You guys are training to be doctors, right?
To heal people who are sick?
You guys are douchebags.
- Stop.
- Did you know that?
- Total douchebags.
- Stop!
What the hell was that?
I was expressing my opinion.
You don't have an opinion.
You're an interpreter.
You don't have a voice.
You don't have a presence.
You don't have opinions.
I'm not gonna just stand there and take that from those...
Your job is to interpret what I can't hear, not to speak for me, not to think for me, not to defend me, and not to piss off my classmates.
Well, I can't do that.
I can't just stand there like a robot.
Well, then you're fired.
What?
Fine.
Renzo:
Feeling better?
(Sighs) A little.
I just feel silly for getting my hopes up.
You never know.
A movie version of your book could still happen.
No, that guy was the only halfway-legitimate contender.
Besides, it would have made a bad movie, anyway.
It would have been a great movie if it were done right.
But you know Hollywood, they'd put Kate Hudson in it and that smarmy Jim guy from The Office and ruin it.
I like him.
You should have Lydia take it to Broadway.
They could make a musical out of it.
- Oh, yeah, right.
- (Laughs)
At least there'd be some dancing in it.
Pa, pa-pa, pa-pa, pow!
There could be like a whole chorus line of shirtless ballboys.
Yes, please!
♪ Oh, say, what do you see?
♪
♪ Those balls don't look foul to me ♪
♪ come on, boys, raise those mitts ♪
♪ touch those bases, get some hits ♪
♪ put your ball in my glove, it's a home run ♪
♪ this is love ♪
Yeah!
See?
It writes itself.

- _
- Is that all you're eating?
I'm not really hungry.
- _
- All right. (Sighs)
How's Emmett?
Fine.
Bay?
_
- Bay!
- Hmm?
Do you mind looking at me when I'm talking to you?
I'm sorry.
Emmett's going into a screening, and he's not gonna be able to use his phone.
I'm not sure how healthy all this constant texting is.
Dad, I had to beg him to go to L.A. without me, and he still could change his mind at any minute.
If he could make it through a couple weeks, make some friends, then he'll be okay.
But until then...
I have to make him believe that it's not a big deal we're so far away from each other.
Okay.
Please tell him we send our best.
_
_
_
_
You fired him?
So, who's gonna interpret for you?
No one.
There's no one else.
I just have to do it myself.
I need to get better at lip-reading chemistry words.
Can you help me practice?
Sure.
I highlighted a bunch of words that I need to recognize.
Just read them and jump around.
Okay.
Coefficient.
- Coefficient.
- (Giggles)
Polyatomic.
Polyatomic.
Pick a hard one and don't over enunciate, 'cause she won't.
Halogenated.
Halogenated.
(Sighs)
How long do you need it?
It's a type of unsaturated hydrocarbon.
Try again.
Enthalpies.
It looks like you're saying,
"end of peace," but I know that's wrong.
(Groans)
It just takes practice.
Pick another word.
What's the 911?
All right, this might seem a little crazy, but...
The musical!
Yes!
I couldn't sleep all night.
I kept seeing dance numbers in my head, and writing lyrics to songs.
Didn't I tell you?
I'm a genius.
But that's the thing.
You're right.
This would make a good musical, but I've never written one before.
So?
You'd never written a book before, and now you've written two.
That's true.
You know, we should do it.
Whoa, "we"?
Yes, you're the one that got the ball rolling.
No, no, no.
That's all I'm good for... the big picture, not the details.
Like, I could tell Ricardo that his guest bath needed a new look, but I couldn't tell him which tile to buy.
It's your idea.
You run with it.
Okay, but...
Will you come to see it, even if nobody else does?
Are you kidding?
I'll be leading the standing ovation.
But first, let's cast that chorus line of shirtless ballboys.
I thought I fired you.
Didn't stick.
Did Iris call you?
That was nice of her, but...
This isn't working out.
Here's the thing.
Hearing kid, deaf parents.
I was their ears and voice starting at age five.
If the cleaners ruined my dad's shirt, or if my mom's soup was too salty...
You had to fight their battles.
It wasn't all bad.
In fourth grade, the interpreter didn't show up, so I had to interpret my own parent-teacher conference.
I bet your behavior was perfect.
She said
I was doing excellent in every arena.
(Chuckles)
All this to say... someone like you, an empowered deafie... it's a new thing for me.
I just have to get used to it.
I need you, but I can't have you talking for me.
Ears only.
Got it.
So...
I stopped by the chemistry department and... got the notes for the next class.
You get advanced notes?
Yeah.
Hey, let me use your phone.
I'm waiting for a call.
What's wrong with yours?
It's out of minutes.
- It's important.
- So is the call that I'm waiting for.
What, your boyfriend?
I have to call Robbie's lawyer about getting him out.
You remember Robbie, the guy who got busted because of you.
You can borrow it as soon as I'm done with my call.
Lunch will be over by then.
- You owe me.
- (Sighs)
Hey!
No, that is my phone.
Give me the friggin' phone!
There's your phone.
You psycho!
I do not owe you anything.
That guy got busted because he is a drug dealer.
That is on him, not me.
I told you messing with me was a mistake.
Do whatever you want.
I already can't go to L.A. to be with my boyfriend for a whole year.
I got nothing else to lose.
Hey.
Hey!
What the hell is going on?
What's the problem here, Tess?
Did she do that?
No, I dropped it.
All right. 15 minutes and we're back to work.
Not my bike again.
I want you to know
I got involved with the development project for all the right reasons.
You don't owe me an explanation.
You took Juanita's word about what happened and threw me out.
Threw you out is an overstatement.
I grew up in this neighborhood.
I saw a chance to do something good for it, and I took it.
But I got in over my head, and I made mistakes.
I still think I could do something good.
Let me help you with your coffeehouse.
Help how?
I'm an interior designer.
I can give your place the look you want to get it open.
(Laughs)
Uh, I don't think that would be a smart move for me right now.
_
I can hire someone who speaks Spanish.
But I grew up here.
I know these people.
Yeah, and they don't like you, and they don't trust you.
They used to, and I can win them back.
What does that have to do with me and my coffeehouse?
Well, this is how I get them back on my side.
And in exchange, I can bring money to help you get this place up and running.
Things are always more expensive than they say at first.
Well, I did get an estimate on bringing the plumbing up to code.
You wanna draw people in?
Make this a neighborhood hangout?
We could make part of the space an art gallery for local artists, or once a week we can do an open mic night.
There are some really talented people in this neighborhood.
We can sell Juanita's brownies, but also carry healthy snacks so that parents have options when they bring their kids.
We don't even know each other.
I'm Regina.
Regina Vasquez.
Also known as la malinche.
What is malinche anyway?
A traitorous whore.
Damn.
Yeah.
Eric.
Eric Bishop.
Whoo, Jimmy. (Clears throat)
Looks like you hit the jackpot.
All right, we got another dead rat, and this one's ripe.
Who's gonna do the honors?
Who's a team player?
Come on.
It's not getting any fresher.
She's not supposed to do that.
What'd you say?
We're not supposed to touch dead animals.
You're supposed to call animal control.
Says who?
There's a lawsuit against the county about it.
I mean, if you don't care about that...
All right.
Somebody give me some tongs.
I'll do it.
(Whispers) Thank you.
It's no big deal.
Kathryn:
Okay.
Gentle.
Just around the corner.
Right over here.
This is perfect.
There you go.
Ah.
Did I miss something?
I bought a piano.

Okay.
(Phone camera clicking)
About yesterday... maybe we could have handled it better.
We'd like to have you back in the group.
You mean me and my advanced notes.
They'd be helpful.
We'd be helping each other out.
I need you to slow down and speak clearly, so that I can follow the discussion.
Either I or Josh will let you know when you're going too fast.
Agreed.
We're meeting at 7:00 tonight, the chem classroom.
We'll be there.

Previously on switchedatbirth...
People are calling you lamalinche.
Cortes' whore?
What happens when your landlords double our rent?
I pulled out of east riverside.
-I'm iris.
-Daphne.
I'm in the interpreter program.
Do you know a guy named robbie?
Yes, i know who you're talking about.
Is there somewhere i can leave this for him?
Why don't i just give it to him?
Didn't i make it clear that i'm with him?
Stay away from him.
You didn't know that the turkey sandwich that you so stupidly handed over
To an inmate had a bag of heroin stuffed inside it?
Oh my god.
You just became an accessory to a felony drug deal.
Professor marillo, i heard that your "chemistry i" class was filled,
And i was hoping to persuade you to let me in.
You have an interpreter?
We go 90 miles an hour.
Get someone who knows what the hell they're talking about,
Or you will drown.
Josh, this is my roommate daphne.
I have a proposition for you.
We will text constantly.
It's the right decision.

-Hey.
Hey, good morning.
-No, it's not.
-I have class in 10 minutes.
-What happened?
I wanted to get a full eight hours before my first chem class,
And i took a sleeping pill.
-Uh-oh.
-It completely knocked me out.
I think i turned off my alarm and went back to sleep.
I'm sorry.
Can i help?
No.
I'll see you later.
(rock music playing)
(door slams)
Are you going to the gym?
Uh, i don't understand.
I wouldn't come to teach wearing sweatpants.
I ask for the same respect from you.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
Might be a good time
To go over my other rules.
No phones.
No food.
No drink.
No gum.
Ugh, hate gum.
Hate it.
This is 90 minutes for chemistry,
And this material takes a lot of focus.
Coming late, texting, eating--
All of that takes away concentration
From the other students.
Mr. Padden, you're back.
I'm not in the class.
Just interpreting.
You know sign language?
My parents are deaf.
Well, whatever language you use,
Let's try to keep it civil, shall we?
Office hours are
Tuesday, thursday, noon to 2:00,
Sciences building.
Now, technically i'm there to answer
Any questions about the week's material,
But if you want to come and talk to me about...
French bulldogs, or claude debussy,
Or the science of love--
Which just happens to have been my phd thesis topic,
Great topic--
I'm very happy to talk about any of that.
If the hours don't work for you,
Let me know.
We will work something out.
Any questions so far?
(theme music playing)
So, do you want some breakfast?
Oh, thanks, but i should get bay to her gig on time.
-Oh.
-Thank you.
-Hey.
-There's our little community servant.
You ready to go?
-You're driving me?
-Yeah.
The corrections office is on my way to kd.
Oh, um...
Dad could drive me.
Right, dad?
Regina:
Why?
The drop off is not at the corrections office today.
It's in east riverside.
I didn't think you'd want to go.
(sighs)
It's been months.
I'll be fine.
Here you go, honey.
Have a good day and don't take anything from strangers,
Actually, because of someone,
We're not allowed to bring lunch anymore.
They're feeding us.
-Thanks anyway.
-Oh.
Thank you.
-See you later.
-Bye.
Hey, you know what?
We should have lunch at the club.
That movie producer is coming over for coffee,
And i have to get things ready, so...
Batter up, the movie,
Coming soon to a theater near you.
Actually, he emailed me this morning,
And he was wondering if you were gonna be here.
He wants to meet you.
Really?
Why?
Why do people always want to meet john kennish?
All right, i'll dust off a war story or two.
Like that'll be hard to do.
History tells me that one-third of you
Will fail.
Of the remaining two-thirds,
Few of you will make above a "c."
At least one of you is going to cry
At some point during this class.
Oh, and several of you
Will have a grandmother die the night before
Or the morning of the midterm.
You have my condolences in advance,
But no, you will not be exempt from taking the exam.
I don't believe in excuses,
Or leniency, or wiggle room.
Chemistry...
-It is an exact...
-(claps)
-Excuse me?
-...
Science governed by laws
And rules.
It's just really distracting.
I like to think i run this class with similar clarity...
Regina:
Are you sure this is it?
Bay:
In the alley around back.
Regina:
Bye.
Ooh.
Damn it.
(sighs)
(soft blues playing)
Hello?
Hi, i'm looking for the owner of the motorcycle parked out front.
(sighs) great.
I'm sorry.
Is it yours?
I...
Sort of tapped it.
Looks like more than a tap.
I-i have insurance.
Still not what i need right now.
You can write down your info here.
Of course.
Well, at least you didn't keep going.
That would be a hit and run.
Only if you got caught.
This place yours?
I've never seen it before.
It was a boot and shoe place.
Right.
-You live around here?
-I used to.
I got this place on the cheap about six weeks ago.
-Lucky you.
-Yeah.
I guess some big, new development was supposed to go up across the street,
But it tanked, taking the property values down with it.
I think i heard something about that.
Is that machine working?
Can i get a cup of coffee?
Sure.
I like the name,
"cracked mug."
It feels right for this neighborhood.
Cracked but still here.
Yeah, just like me.
Me too.
So, have you owned other coffeehouses before?
No, not coffeehouses,
But other businesses.
And i have a lot of opinions about coffee.
Like...?
Well, everyone's very particular about the kind of mug they want their coffee in.
Some people like it tall and skinny to keep it hot.
Other people like it short and big
To wrap their hands around.
Some people like handles.
Other people like the little chinese cups.
I wanted a place where you could request the kind of mug you want.
-That's cool.
-Yeah.
I was thinking of putting a chess and checkers set over in one corner.
Oh, dominoes too.
The old folks around here love to play dominoes.
Thanks.
I, um...
Don't know my license plate number by heart.
I'll be right back.
-Okay.
-'kay.
Man:
Listen up, i got an announcement.
Because of a recent incident...
Today there's some new rules.
No fraternizing with outsiders.
If i see you talking to anyone i don't know,
You're getting a write-up.
No going to the bathroom by yourself.
You need to go?
See me.
Last thing.
No phones.
Not even at lunch.
Turn 'em off, and put them in this bucket.
Now.
What was he talking about?
What incident?
I thought you knew.
(chuckles)
That sandwich i gave robbie the last time...
There were drugs in it.
What?
-Yeah.
-Oh my god.
Oh my-- that's why he's not here?
-His sister dropped it off.
-He doesn't have a sister.
Brunette, blue car?
That's annie, his ex.
I knew he was still in touch with that little whore.
I'm so sorry, tess.
She told me that she was his sister,
-And that her name was marcy.
-And you believed her?
Do you know how bad you just screwed things up for me?
Phones in the bucket.
Robbie got busted with contraband?
That's the word.
But he's still getting out in a month, right?
Not my area,
-But i doubt it.
-We were gonna move in together.
I put a deposit down on a place.
I'd make a different plan if i were you.
On the other hand,
One more write up and you'll be behind bars too.
That's kind of like living together.
Phones.
Again, i am really sorry.
These are brownies and scones,
And i also make pan dulce, if your customers prefer that.
Well, i'm not sure how much food we're gonna carry,
But i can get back to you.
Well...
Thank you so much.
Juanita.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I'm just here for coffee.
(scoffs) i can't believe you have the nerve
To show your face.
I wasn't the one who pulled the plug on the project.
No, your boyfriend did,
After he cheated everyone out of a fair price for their businesses.
-He's not my boyfriend.
-Do you think things were bad before?
They are a lot worse now.
I'm asking this man if he will buy my brownies.
I am so sorry.
When the project folded, i lost too.
Oh, please.
(yelling) look at you with your fancy purse
And your fancy jacket!
What did you lose?
-Juanita, yelling at me-- -go to hell!
Malinche.
Well, i just figured out who you are.
Sorry about that.
You all done writing down your info?
Yeah.
And you can take this...
To go.
Look, i don't know all the facts,
But i'm trying to start a business here.
And as a guy from the outside,
I'm already suspect.
I can't afford to start out on the wrong foot.
Got it.
And then same thing...
If you add an "o5,"
You get "h2-c2-o5,"
Or peroxalic acid.
Okay, you know what?
Let's just stop there.
Congratulations, you survived your first class.
Nobody fainted, nobody lost their organic granola breakfast.
-Come on, give yourselves a hand.
-(applause)
Very good.
Get out of here.
Oh, i advise forming study groups of four.
That will keep you honest, okay?
See you tomorrow.
Hey, you guys look smart.
Can i be in your group?
-Yes.
-Yeah, that'd be awesome
-Do you know anyone here?
-No.
Do you want me to ask if--
No, i got it.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm daphne.
Vimla.
-Is this your study group?
-Mm-hmm.
It looks like you need one more.
Can i be your fourth?
Sure.
Um, if it's okay with you guys.
-Of course.
-Yeah, why not.
Thanks so much.
Of course we'll have the ball players,
And the groupies, and the sex-capades.
Those are just the fireworks,
But it all needs to be grounded in something personal,
Emotional.
Well, to me, it's a story of a woman who loses her innocence.
That is exactly what i was going to say.
Good, i'm glad you agree.
So just make sure you don't lose sight of that
When you're writing the screenplay.
Um...
Wait.
You want me to write the screenplay?
I mean, you know i've never written one before, right?
So what?
Don't you want someone with more of a track record?
I mean--
Let me ask you something.
When you were writing the book,
Did you see the story as...
Pictures in your mind?
Oh, yeah, of course i did.
Well, then you've already written it.
The rest is just a format.
Any valet parker in l.A. Can teach you that.
We'll hire one, a few bucks a week, as your assistant,
Boom.
Instant screenplay.
(chuckles) boom.
-Who pays for that?
-Oh.
Production.
Comes right out of the budget,
Which, for a film like this, is about $6 million,
And i've got four of it lined up already.
-(gasps) -(phone vibrates)
Oh, i'm sorry.
It's my editor.
I told her i was meeting with you,
And i just want to tell her that she might be talking to a new screenwriter.
(laughs)
Let her know you got a hit here!
(laughs)
And i do believe that.
I would not have flown all the way out here from l.A.
To meet with the two of you if i didn't.
Thank you.
I had nothing to do with it.
It's all kathryn.
But you do believe that her book would make a great movie, yes?
-Absolutely.
-Great.
Good, i'm glad you think so.
Because this film...
It can be your success, too.
Really?
Hey.
-Leave me alone.
-Look.
I said i was sorry.
Does that help me?
Let me make it up to you.
How?
Can you get in a time machine, go back, and stay the hell away
From robbie like i told you to in the first place?
I wish that i had.
I'm screwed here, too.
My boyfriend's in california,
And he's probably calling me right now, and i can't answer
-Because my phone's-- -you can't talk to your boyfriend?
I am this close to losing my kid to foster care...
-I know you have it way worse.
-Gordon:
Hey!
...And you can't talk to your boyfriend?
Hey, hey, hey!
What is it with you two?
I told you to cut out the bickering.
I was just sitting here.
She started in on me.
I did not start in on you.
Eh, eh, eh.
Come with me.
I know how to make everyone happy.
What's that smell?
My guess is a dead rat.
I don't think this is safe.
That's what these are for.
Now...
When you find the jackpot,
Bag it, put it with the rest of the garbage.
I thought you said this was gonna make everyone happy?
Oops, i meant it was going to make me happy.
This is not fair.
I was minding my own business.
Give me a reason, tess.
You think i give a rat's ass that you have a kid waiting for you
Back at whatever pit you crawled out of?
I don't.
I wouldn't think twice about writing you up
And getting you locked up like robbie,
Just so i don't have to look at you anymore.
So give me a reason.
Now what do you have to say?
Hey, i left some mail for you that somehow landed in our box.
Thanks.
You're home early.
Yeah, i never made it in.
Why's that?
Uh, when i...
Dropped bay off in east riverside i got ambushed
By somebody pretty pissed off at me
For what happened with the development.
Regina, people get emotional.
You gotta take their griping with a grain of salt.
I know.
It just...
It made me sad all over again.
I wanted to do something good for the neighborhood.
I know you did.
Anyway, i mean...
After getting yelled at like that,
I didn't want to go to kd
And stare at tasteful, beige wallpaper samples.
Sounds like an honest day's work to me,
And i would imagine that customer will not be calling you
With death threats.
Look, it's just my opinion, but i think you should steer clear
Of that neighborhood for the time being.
Yeah.
(gags)
I think i found it.
Is it a rat?
How do i know?
It's in there.
I see something, but i don't think we can reach it.
You're gonna have to crawl in there and get it.
Me?
Hah, no.
You can do it.
It's your fault we're here in the first place.
You were arguing too.
You got robbie in trouble.
I gave him his lunch!
-I'm not going in there.
-Listen to me.
You owe me.
You said you wanted to make it up to me.
Here's your chance.
Do it.
Hey.
Don't forget these.
(groans)
Tank:
Hey, hey!
Felonious b.
Kennish.
What are you doing here?
Oh, your brother had some d.J. Emergency.
Now come on, i had to park a block away.
What's that smell?
-You don't want to know.
-Hmm.
Bad day?
The only kind i have right now.
What happened?
I tried to do something nice,
And i ended up getting on the wrong side of this godzilla,
Who now has it out for me.
Ooh, is she fire-breathing?
I don't know, but she's definitely out for blood.
You just got to stand up to her.
How?
Take her on.
If she's godzilla, you gotta be ghidorah.
-Who?
-It's godzilla's nemesis.
Look, when you show up for work tomorrow,
Go up to her,
And just start whaling on her.
-Tank!
-What?
Prison rules.
Haven't you seen escapefromalcatraz?
I'm not in prison,
And i'm not gonna go up and whale on anybody.
Do you remember who i am?
Yes, do you remember what i taught you in field hockey?
No.
Okay.
All right, look.
You gotta face the ball with fury.
(growls)
(growls louder)
-Come on, let's see it.
-What else you got?
(sighs) um...
How about a peace offering?
Yeah, tried that, didn't work.
Well, can you ask to transfer to another work crew?
That's not an option.
(sighs) well...
Look, you gotta find some way to show her you're not gonna back down,
Or every day is gonna be like this.
The metal loses electrons to become a cation,
And the nonmetal gains electrons to become an anion.
-Cat is the positive one, right?
-Wait, are you sure?
Yeah, and the resulting compound name ends in "ide,"
Like magnesium bromide.
-Wait, what was that?
-Magnesium bromide.
It's just an example of an ionic compound.
I wanna what?
(muffled speaking)
Time out.
Guys, i can't interpret
For all three of you at the same time.
If we could just slow down a little bit.
-Slow down?
We need to go faster.
-Sorry.
It's just, we're slogging through this, and we still have another chapter to cover.
You know what?
Why don't we just call it for tonight,
And we can review the rest on our own.
No, no.
We don't need to stop.
I just need a moment to catch up.
The more people that are talking at once, the harder it is to follow.
I'll get better at it.
Josh will, too.
Don't worry about it.
I'll see you in class.
(sighs)
You know, honey, i thought that producer
Was just gonna wanna talk about the sex scenes,
But he surprised me.
He wants to give the characters more depth.
We are totally in sync.
(sighs) you didn't like him, did you?
You know, i thought he was a little slick.
I think you can do better.
Better?
How?
He's the only serious interest i've had in the movie rights.
Well, you don't have to pick him just 'cause he's the only one who asked.
I see.
What?
(sighs) forget it.
Kathryn!
You're used to getting all the attention.
Ex-major league ball player,
And all he wanted to do was talk about my book.
Admit it.
Your ego is a little bruised.
Right?
(chuckles) come on.
He was fishing for money.
He needs to raise $6 million to make the movie.
He said he had all the money lined up.
Yeah, he was bluffing.
When you took the call, he hit me up for a million,
And asked if i knew any other retired ballplayers who might be interested.
Does he...
Even want to make the movie?
If i finance it, yeah.
(sighs)
I see.
Hey, i'm sorry.
I'm gonna get some air.
(sighs)
That was a disaster.
I can't be unprepared like that again.
Why are you acting like that was my fault?
We need to come up with signs so you don't have to fingerspell everything.
There are a lot of words!
We'll start with the common elements of the periodic table.
(chattering)
What's going on?
Oh. (scoffs)
Didn't you get my text?
I texted everyone.
There was no text.
I don't understand.
They're meeting without you.
Look, it's not personal.
Hmm.
'cause dumping someone never is.
We just have to go at a different pace.
We think maybe you'd be better off in a different group.
I'm sorry that i was so--
Why are you sorry?
They should be sorry.
What?
They can't take the extra three minutes
It would take to let us catch up?
-Josh, i got this.
-You guys are training to be doctors, right?
To heal people who are sick?
You guys are douchebags.
-Stop.
-Did you know that?
-Total douchebags.
-Stop!
What the hell was that?
I was expressing my opinion.
You don't have an opinion.
You're an interpreter.
You don't have a voice.
You don't have a presence.
You don't have opinions.
I'm not gonna just stand there and take that from those--
Your job is to interpret what i can't hear,
Not to speak for me, not to think for me,
Not to defend me,
And not to piss off my classmates.
Well, i can't do that.
I can't just stand there like a robot.
Well, then you're fired.
What?
Fine.
Renzo:
Feeling better?
(sighs) a little.
I just feel silly for getting my hopes up.
You never know.
A movie version of your book could still happen.
No, that guy was the only halfway-legitimate contender.
Besides, it would have made a bad movie, anyway.
It would have been a great movie if it were done right.
But you know hollywood, they'd put kate hudson in it
And that smarmy jim guy from the office and ruin it.
I like him.
You should have lydia take it to broadway.
They could make a musical out of it.
-Oh, yeah, right.
-(laughs)
At least there'd be some dancing in it.
Pa, pa-pa, pa-pa, pow!
There could be like a whole chorus line of shirtless ballboys.
Yes, please!

See?
It writes itself.
Is that all you're eating?
I'm not really hungry.
All right.
(sighs)
How's emmett?
Fine.
Bay?
-Bay!
-Hmm?
Do you mind looking at me when i'm talking to you?
I'm sorry.
Emmett's going into a screening,
And he's not gonna be able to use his phone.
I'm not sure how healthy all this constant texting is.
Dad, i had to beg him to go to l.A. Without me,
And he still could change his mind at any minute.
If he could make it through a couple weeks,
Make some friends, then he'll be okay.
But until then...
I have to make him believe
That it's not a big deal we're so far away from each other.
Okay.
Please tell him we send our best.
You fired him?
So, who's gonna interpret for you?
No one.
There's no one else.
I just have to do it myself.
I need to get better at lip-reading chemistry words.
Can you help me practice?
Sure.
I highlighted a bunch of words that i need to recognize.
Just read them and jump around.
Okay.
Coefficient.
-Coefficient.
-(giggles)
Polyatomic.
Polyatomic.
Pick a hard one and don't over enunciate, 'cause she won't.
Halogenated.
Halogenated.
(sighs)
How long do you need it?
It's a type of unsaturated hydrocarbon.
Try again.
Enthalpies.
It looks like you're saying,
"end of peace," but i know that's wrong.
(groans)
It just takes practice.
Pick another word.
What's the 911?
All right, this might seem a little crazy, but--
The musical!
Yes!
I couldn't sleep all night.
I kept seeing dance numbers in my head,
And writing lyrics to songs.
Didn't i tell you?
I'm a genius.
But that's the thing.
You're right.
This would make a good musical,
But i've never written one before.
So?
You'd never written a book before,
And now you've written two.
That's true.
You know, we should do it.
Whoa, "we"?
Yes, you're the one that got the ball rolling.
No, no, no.
That's all i'm good for--
The big picture, not the details.
Like, i could tell ricardo that his guest bath needed a new look,
But i couldn't tell him which tile to buy.
It's your idea.
You run with it.
Okay, but...
Will you come to see it, even if nobody else does?
Are you kidding?
I'll be leading the standing ovation.
But first, let's cast that chorus line of shirtless ballboys.
I thought i fired you.
Didn't stick.
Did iris call you?
That was nice of her, but...
This isn't working out.
Here's the thing.
Hearing kid, deaf parents.
I was their ears and voice starting at age five.
If the cleaners ruined my dad's shirt,
Or if my mom's soup was too salty--
You had to fight their battles.
It wasn't all bad.
In fourth grade, the interpreter didn't show up,
So i had to interpret my own parent-teacher conference.
I bet your behavior was perfect.
She said
I was doing excellent in every arena.
(chuckles)
All this to say...
Someone like you,
An empowered deafie...
It's a new thing for me.
I just have to get used to it.
I need you,
But i can't have you talking for me.
Ears only.
Got it.
So...
I stopped by the chemistry department and...
Got the notes for the next class.
You get advanced notes?
Yeah.
Hey, let me use your phone.
I'm waiting for a call.
What's wrong with yours?
It's out of minutes.
-It's important.
-So is the call i'm waiting for.
What, your boyfriend?
I have to call robbie's lawyer about getting him out.
You remember robbie, the guy who got busted because of you.
You can borrow it as soon as i'm done with my call.
Lunch will be over by then.
-You owe me.
-(sighs)
Hey!
No, that is my phone.
Give me the friggin' phone!
There's your phone.
You psycho!
I do not owe you anything.
That guy got busted because he is a drug dealer.
That is on him, not me.
I told you messing with me was a mistake.
Do whatever you want.
I already can't go to l.A. To be with my boyfriend
For a whole year.
I got nothing else to lose.
Hey.
Hey!
What the hell is going on?
What's the problem here, tess?
Did she do that?
No, i dropped it.
All right.
15 minutes and we're back to work.
Not my bike again.
I want you to know
I got involved with the development project for all the right reasons.
You don't owe me an explanation.
You took juanita's word about what happened and threw me out.
Threw you out is an overstatement.
I grew up in this neighborhood.
I saw a chance to do something good for it, and i took it.
But i got in over my head,
And i made mistakes.
I still think i could do something good.
Let me help you with your coffeehouse.
Help how?
I'm an interior designer.
I can give your place the look you want to get it open.
(laughs)
Uh, i don't think that would be a smart move for me right now.
(speaks spanish)
I can hire someone who speaks spanish.
But i grew up here.
I know these people.
Yeah, and they don't like you,
And they don't trust you.
They used to, and i can win them back.
What does that have to do with me and my coffeehouse?
Well, this is how i get them back on my side.
And in exchange, i can bring money
To help you get this place up and running.
Things are always more expensive than they say at first.
Well, i did get an estimate on bringing the plumbing up to code.
You wanna draw people in?
Make this a neighborhood hangout?
We could make part of the space
An art gallery for local artists,
Or once a week we can do an open mic night.
There are some really talented people in this neighborhood.
We can sell juanita's brownies,
But also carry healthy snacks
So that parents have options when they bring their kids.
We don't even know each other.
I'm regina.
Regina vasquez.
Also known as lamalinche.
What is malinche anyway?
A traitorous whore.
Damn.
Yeah.
Eric.
Eric bishop.
Whoo, jimmy.
(clears throat)
Looks like you hit the jackpot.
All right, we got another dead rat, and this one's ripe.
Who's gonna do the honors?
Who's a team player?
Come on.
It's not getting any fresher.
She's not supposed to do that.
What'd you say?
We're not supposed to touch dead animals.
You're supposed to call animal control.
Says who?
There's a lawsuit against the county about it.
I mean, if you don't care about that...
All right.
Somebody give me some tongs.
I'll do it.
(whispers) thank you.
It's no big deal.
Kathryn:
Okay.
Gentle.
Just around the corner.
Right over here.
This is perfect.
There you go.
Ah.
Did i miss something?
I bought a piano.

Okay.
(phone camera clicking)
About yesterday...
Maybe we could have handled it better.
We'd like to have you back in the group.
You mean me and my advanced notes.
They'd be helpful.
We'd be helping each other out.
I need you to slow down and speak clearly,
So that i can follow the discussion.
Either i or josh will let you know when you're going too fast.
Agreed.
We're meeting at 7:00 tonight,
The chem classroom.
We'll be there.

Hey, brother Gopu!
You are looking very handsome.
Keep a black spot to ward of evil eyes.
Here..
Keep it.. keep it, Gopu.
Not one, but keep ten, twenty spots.
Evil eyes will fall on you when someone looks at you.
They will see..
Why will they not see?
Will you too not see?
My dear Channo!
See.. see..
See how handsome I look.
Gopu, are you too saying this?
Not handsome but you look bloody fool.
Gopu, it seems sir and madam has come.
You go.
- Okay.
I will do the decoration.
- Okay, fine.
- Go.
Come, sir.
Welcome.
Is he your relative?
No, Barkhaa.
He is not my relative.
But he is not less than any relative.
Come, I will introduce him to you.
He is Gopu.
He is the servant of my house..
..but not less than a family member to me.
You can understand it by seeing his happiness.
Come, sir.
Come.
Anyway, Mrs. Barkhaa.
How did you like this small world of mine?
I have a small request for you.
You should become such a rain in my life that I never remain thirsty.
Yes, I will be the same.
But be careful.
What does it mean?
I will fall with thunderstorms.
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Thank you.
Yes.
Sir, so tell me how was your first night?
Gopu, what kind of question you are asking?
One shouldn't ask anybody about their first night.
It is also not told.
These are private things.
There is nothing private.
My friend was telling everything about first night.
This happened.. that happened..
So funny!
You only said he is like a family member, right?
Now tell him.
What rubbish!
Gopu, tell me something.
- Yes.
When are you getting married?
What should I say, sir?
Some lives are filled with luck.
But my father decides everything for me.
I swear, one day I will search and show..
..whether my age is less or I am small.
Search and tell me?
What will you search and tell?
Sir, it is..
- Shut your mouth, Gopu.
Sir, have I committed any mistake?
Okay, I am going.
Barkhaa!
Barkhaa!
- I am coming!
Ranbir, you didn't tell me that we are going on tour.
Barkhaa, we are not going on any tour.
In fact I am going.
Alone?
But where?
Barkhaa, just now I received a message... that there is a war like situation at border.
I have to go urgently.
But Ranbir.. during the time of marriage, you said you will stay for few days.
We didn't come close to each other yet.
We neither understood each other and you are going..
Barkhaa, I know that I am leaving you and your desires unfulfilled.
But Barkhaa I am a soldier too.
Duty comes first for a soldier..
..family comes next.
But I will become alone without you.
I don't even know anybody here.
Barkhaa..
- I cannot live without you.
- Barkhaa..
I too cannot stay but what to do.
We have to live.
Gopu and Chonu are there to take care of you.
Trust me, they will keep you very happy.
And you too take care.
Ranbir, I wish you remained so closer to me..
So closer..
Ranbir, are you back?
Who are you?
I am Akaash.
Akaash?
I am Ranbir's friend and I came from Delhi.
I called up Ranbir few days back..
..and said I came to Mumbai on some work..
..and I am going to stay in his house.
He told about you.
Anyway, where is my friend Ranbir?
He went on duty.
Duty?
but..
- But you need not worry.
You can stay here even in his absence.
Thanks.
May I know who you are?
She is our madam.
Sir got married.
What?
Ranbir got married.
This is too much.
I mean he didn't inform friends.
He thought we don't deserve to attend his wedding.
Everything happened so quickly that there was no chance to inform.
Sorry..
Why do you say sorry?
Ranbir should say sorry.
Anyways, wish you a very happy marriage life.
Thanks.
Gopu.
- Yes, madam.
Keep sir's room in the guest room upstairs.
- Okay, madam.
"La..
la..
la "
Come, sir.
This is your room.
You stay here and have fun and enjoy.
Very nice place.
So mister army man is living a wonderful life here.
Brother Gopu, you are right.
Now I have come to such place where I will have fun and also enjoy.
Okay, sir.
Now I will go.
Hey, where are you going?
Talk to me.
No, sir.
It has been very late.
Otherwise Channu will get angry on me..
and say I do nothing and roam around.
Now let me go, sir.
I am very late.
Otherwise she will show me hell.
Hey, come on.
Hey, Gopu.
What are you watching secretly?
Come in front and see.
Ever did you see a beautiful girl like this?
- No.
Ever did you see a young girl like this?
- No.
So see me to your heart's content.
All this is for you.
- What are you saying?
Is this beautiful young lady for me?
What are you watching so much like that?
Will you just see or something?
Hey, Gopu!
What are you watching like a dog?
What is the matter?
No, Channu.
I am watching with a very good intention.
You were looking very beautiful.
Otherwise I will tell you, you were looking really hot.
Go away!
Channu, truth is..
..that you have caused emotional attack on me by showing your hot figure.
Hi, sister-in-law.
Hi.
What is the matter?
Why are you sitting here alone?
You look very lonely.
Just like that..
Hey, why don't you say that you are lost in Ranbir's thoughts?
And it should happen.
Sister-in-law, I know..
..that you are feeling lonely and bored without Ranbir.
But what can we do, Ranbir's job is like that.
Sister-in-law, should I say something?
Smile looks good on your beautiful face, not sadness.
And believe me, if Ranbir was here then he too would have said the same.
Good morning, sister-in-law.
Good morning.
Nice body.
It seems you are very interested in building body.
Yes.
Person should remain fit in life.
And then by doing exercise body too will become good apart from healthy.
And with a good body, we can attract people.
I will say that you too should do exercise.
No!
No!
I wish to stay away from this interest.
What are your other interests?
Well, apart from this, I like photography..
Or you may say that I like to capture beautiful things in my camera.
Are you married?
No.
Any girlfriend?
No.
You are very handsome and you are not married yet.
Well, you are not married, that is okay but you should be having a girlfriend.
It seems you didn't take any advantage of being handsome.
Well, I will do it now.
Sister-in-law, by the way, you must be feeling very lonely after Ranbir's going.
And this loneliness must be difficult to spent.
I think there is only one option to remove this loneliness .
You focus your heart and mind on something that like.
And believe me, your loneliness will be removed after that.
I think now I should do the same thing.
Gopu..
Gopu!
Yes?
Yes, Channu?
Did you see..
..after sir left madam has become alone and lonely.
It looks as if she forgot to smile and laugh.
Channu, I know when a loved one goes away then one becomes lonely and dejected.
I think sir shouldn't have left madam alone like this.
What would have happened had he stayed for few more days?
If he stayed back then would you go to fight at the border?
Giving advice..
Gopu, you don't know..
..that after marriage, lot of desires arise inside a woman.
She can share them only with her husband and nobody.
Hey, why are we becoming worried by thinking about this?
Look.
Channu.
Whoever goes through it, they will find a solution for it.
Did you understand?
Now give tea.
Barkhaa, I know that I am leaving you and your desires unfulfilled.
But Barkhaa I am a soldier too.
Duty comes first for a soldier, family comes next.
But I will become alone without you.
I cannot live without you.
- Barkhaa, I too cannot live.
But what can I do, I have to do.
I think there is only one option to remove this loneliness.
You focus your heart and mind on something that makes you like.
Gopu..
- Yes?
- Akaash sir is very nice, right?
And he talks good things too.
He laughs and makes everyone laugh.
Yes, he is very joyful person.
But whoever lives with him, they will be very happy.
And he is very handsome too.
Channu..
- Yes..
- Hope you are not in love with him.
Hey, no, no.
But if I get a chance, I will not leave it.
What?
- Yes..
Sister-in-law, come.
Hope I didn't disturb you.
No, nothing like that.
I was sitting alone so I thought to meet you.
I will feel better.
You did a good thing..
..because when your heart starts liking something then it will feel better too.
I have request for you.
Request?
What request?
You don't call me sister-in-law, you may call me Barkhaa.
Anyway, we are of same age.
So what is the need for formality?
Okay fine.
If you say then I will call you as Barkhaa from today.
Mrs. Barkhaa, this is fine, right?
Not Mrs. Barkhaa, just Barkhaa.
Okay.
Barkhaa.
You talk very good.
And I still remember your words.
You said..
..to remove loneliness, we should focus our heart and mind on something that we like.
I am going to do the same.
So can I ask where you are focusing your heart and mind?
Think that my eyes are searching him.
Anyways..
You said that like to capture beauty in your camera very much.
If I look beautiful to you from that point of view..
..then you can capture from beauty in your camera.
Wow!
Very good idea.
By the way, should I say something if you don't feel bad.
I will not feel bad on anything you say.
Tell me.
You are not an example of beauty but you are a flame.
The day it burns, it will set ablaze many desires.
So click..
- Oh!
Mrs. Barkhaa, see your beautiful photographs.
You look very beautiful.
Wow!
Amazing!
You have captured my beauty very beautifully in your camera.
Mrs. Barkhaa, you are so beautiful..
..that your beauty cannot be captured in this camera.
So where can it be captured.
In eyes.
So when do you want to capture in eyes?
By the way, your eyes are wonderful, they have given identity to my beauty as beautiful.
Otherwise I had forgotten that I am beautiful.
Thank you.
Sometimes I think what would have happened to me if you were not there.
Maybe very bad it would have been.
Thank God.
Because of you I am trying to forget my loneliness.
And that day will come when this loneliness will be lost forever.
Mrs. Barkhaa, what you wish will only happen.
I am with you.
Barkhaa knows..
..what is going to happen today.
Today your loneliness will be lost forever.
Akaash..
Yes?
Tell me why you called.
Sit.
- Thank you.
Will you drink?
No.
I don't drink.
I forgot men don't get intoxicated with alcohol.
They get intoxicated with youthfulness.
Ms. Barkhaa, I think you are heavily drunk today.
Yes.
I drank more.
Don't know why I feel that I am alone today, completely alone.
And I drank alcohol to get rid of this loneliness.
So sad.
But still I remained alone.
And then why shouldn't I remove this loneliness with you.
Akaash, can you remove my loneliness forever?
Mrs. Barkhaa, what are you doing?
Akaash, truth is that..
..that I was focusing on you to remove my loneliness.
You were the one whom I started liking.
Please, Akaash.
Now this loneliness hurts.
Please, Akaash.
Today you take me into your arms and remove my loneliness forever.
Mrs. Barkhaa, you are unable to understand it.
This is not good.
Akaash, the Barkhaa who quenches others thirst, will she remain thirsty?
Please, Akaash.
Don't leave me thirsty.
Come closer to me, Akaash.
What are you thinking, Akaash.
About Ranbir.
It is only my duty to think of Ranbir.
You just think of me.
Only about me.
"Dear, let me love you indefinitely."
"Why should there be a distance between us?"
"No!
No!
Don't say there is no love on our lips."
"Dear, let me love you indefinitely."
"Why should there be a distance between us?"
"No!
No!
Don't say there is no love on our lips."
"Dear, let me love you indefinitely."
"Hey, you are my mad lover, like a nomad."
"Show grace on me, take me in your arms."
"Hey, you are my mad lover, like a nomad."
"Show grace on me, take me in your arms."
"Dear, I am waiting for you.."
"Why should there be a distance between us?"
"No!
No!
Don't say there is no love on our lips."
"Dear, let me love you indefinitely."
"In your arms, in your waiting, you life is filled with hopes.."
"Where should I go if I were to go, there is magic in your charm."
"In your arms, in your waiting, you life is filled with hopes.."
"Where should I go if I were to go, there is magic in your charm."
"Dear, let there be a love test."
"Why should there be a distance between us?"
"No!
No!
Don't say there is no love on our lips."
"Dear, let me love you indefinitely."
"Let me get you in such a way that I don't lose you after that."
"You are my passion, desire and lust."
"Let me get you in such a way that I don't lose you after that."
"You are my passion, desire and lust."
"Dear, I started living after getting you."
"Why should there be a distance between us?"
"No!
No!
Don't say there is no love on our lips."
"Dear, let me love you indefinitely."
Akaash, did you love any girl before?
You must have met many girls.
I met but not one whom my heart dreamt of.
I didn't meet the one for whom I felt lot of love for.
But yes, now I got.
Who?
And I have spent my lovely night too with her.
What's her name and her place?
Her name is very beautiful.
I have hidden her photo too inside the heart.
How does she look?
I have seen lot of love for me in her eyes.
Barkhaa, ever did you see yourself in the mirror?
She is beautiful like you.
Madam, sir's call for you.
Tell him to call later.
It is true, brother.
One who goes away, they go away forever.
And the one who comes close, they come more closer.
By the way, you are like that only.
Look, Gopu.
Didn't I say..
..that one who undergoes pain, they will find a way to come out of it.
This is the option.
Now I don't feel like staying away from you.
I want to stay closer to you.
Just close!
And what about Ranbir?
It is only my duty to think of Ranbir.
You just think of me.
Just me.
What happened?
I have to go.
Oh!
Please, come on.
No, Barkhaa.
Now all this cannot happen.
Yes, Ranbir.
I am fine.
How are you?
Your friend Akaash is staying here.
In fact he has taken good care of me after your leaving.
What?
Is Neetu coming to Mumbai?
But why?
For what?
On official work?
Okay.
She can stay as long as she wants.
She has come.
I am putting the phone down.
Hi, sister-in-law!
Hi!
I was talking to your brother just now.
- Okay.
Sister-in-law, we met after many days, isn't it?
We will have fun together now.
Not bad..
Sister-in-law, I thought..
..you will become sad and dejected after brother's leaving.
But you look more happy and beautiful than before.
You started teasing your sister-in-law immediately after your coming.
Wow!
How tasty food it is!
It was great!
Hi!
- Hi!
Who is this gentleman?
Sister-in-law, you didn't tell me about this unknown gentleman.
Akaash, she is Neetu.
Ranbir's cousin.
- Hi!
She too came on some work.
Madam, so I am not unknown to you, right?
Well, mister.
What do you do?
Just think that I am trying to do something.
By the way, you look handsome.
You too are beautiful.
There is nothing special to say, I am beautiful.
Neetu, he is very much interested in photography.
He says he captures beauty in his camera.
Oh!
And my interest lies in opposite to it.
Means?
To get photos clicked.
Hey, Gopu.
Why are you staring at me like that?
I am seeing.. what am I seeing?
You tell me what I am seeing.
I know you well.
If you like it so much then get married and bring your wife.
And keep staring at her all day.
That is not happening.
Had it happened then I swear..
Don't ask about life.
I am leading a great life after coming to Mumbai.
I mean nights are lovely, days are fun..
Listen, your sister-in-law has come.
I have some work.
I will talk to you later, okay?
Bye.
Akaash, now we should meet secretly and not in open.
But why.
She has come, right?
Brother's loving detective sister.
Oh..
Let her come if she has come.
First I used to be happy by watching you,
I will be happy watching her too.
You mister!
Whatever bad things you have to do, do it just with me.
Not allowed other girls.
Only for me.
Oh, my dear.
I am mad over this behaviour of yours.
I am just kidding.
By the way, my heart will not like anything except being in your arms.
Sister-in-law?
Sister-in-law!
Wow!
How good Akaash's body is!
It seems you too like Akaash's body.
That's why you are watching him so keenly.
Wow!
Machoman!
What a great body!
Do you know..
..if any girl falls in your arms once..
..then she will search only you all her life.
So when are you coming into my arms?
No!
Not so early.
By the way, Mr. Machoman.
When are you going to cast your spell of photography on me.
My beauty is ready to get captured in your camera.
I am looking hot, right?
You and here at this time?
You should be happy.
There is some girl in your room at late night.
But madam..
I came by hiding.
One has to take this risk in love.
Love?
What love?
Mr. Machoman, I am not a girl who takes more footage.
That's why I will come to the point.
I love you.
Did you ever think what your sister-in-law will think if she finds out?
My foot!
We should think of only love in love, isn't it?
No!
This is not good.
Akaash, you started loving me.
However you may try to hide, I have read your feelings.
You just love me.
Do however you want..
"Tonight.."
"Let it pass away.."
"In my arms.."
"There is magic in my eyes.."
"There is charm in my attitude.."
"There is magic in my eyes.."
"There is charm in my attitude.."
"There is fire too inside me.."
"Tonight..
let it pass away in my arms.."
"Let this lust be fulfilled.."
"To love you is my greed."
"Let this lust be fulfilled.."
"To love you is my greed."
"I am yours, you are mine.."
"I am yours, you are mine.."
"You are my soul, my God.."
"Tonight..
let it pass away in my arms.."
What are you thinking?
Oh, God!
When will my first night happen?
Hey, Gopu!
First get married.
Oh, God!
When will I get married?
Hey, fool!
First find the girl.
Oh, God!
Where will I find the girl?
Hey, my Tullu is calling.
Hello!
Yes, Tullu?
How are you, brother?
What?
Is it your first night today?
Oh, God!
I think..
I will die a virgin by hearing the stories of my friends' first nights.
Sister-in-law!
What is Akaash like?
I am asking you, Neetu.
He is young, handsome and good looking.
It is good if you stay away from him.
But why are you saying like that, sister-in-law.
I like him.
Shut up!
You came here on some work and not to have fun.
What will I answer your brother?
Concentrate on the work that you came for?
Understood?
What are you watching?
Hey, you!
Nothing.
The climate is good so..
So you are watching Neetu?
Now you get very few reasons to watch me, right?
Akaash, why do I feel that..
..you are forgetting my arms and the way to my bed?
Barkhaa, what do you want to say?
It is what you don't want to understand.
When other woman starts coming closer then you don't need the first woman.
Hope you are not thinking that between Neetu and me..
Affair?
What if it is there?
I have first right on you.
Isn't it?
"Dear, let me love you indefinitely."
"Why should there be a distance between us?"
"No!
No!
Don't say there is.."
"..no love on our lips."
"Dear, let me love you indefinitely."
"Why should there be a distance between us?"
"No!
No!
Don't say there is.."
"..no love on our lips."
"Dear, let me love you indefinitely."
"I am mad lover, like a nomad."
"Show grace on me, take me in your arms."
"I am mad lover, like a nomad."
"Show grace on me, take me in your arms."
"Dear, I am waiting for you.."
"Why should there be a distance between us?"
"No!
No!
Don't say there is.."
"..no love on our lips."
"Dear, let me love you indefinitely."
Two minutes.
What happened, Neetu?
Why are you so sad?
Akaash, why can't I love you?
Why does sister-in-law want to separate me from you?
Neetu, maybe she doesn't like our talking and meeting with each other.
So should we stop talking, meeting and loving each other because of sister-in-law?
Why do you take tension, Neetu?
We loved each other.
And lovers are not afraid of anybody.
I am there, okay?
Who?
- I am Barkhaa.
You go and hide in the bathroom.
Akaash, I think you got bit late in opening the door.
Anyways, Neetu is not in her room.
So what?
So can you tell me where she is?
Barkhaa, do you suspect me?
Why will she come to my room?
Tell me something.
You could have searched her elsewhere too, right?
Do one thing.
Now I am too feeling sleepy.
It is very late, you too go to sleep.
She is not a small girl.
She will come.
Good night.
Okay.
Oh, God!
Don't know why sister-in-law is behind me.
Don't worry, dear.
Were you with Akaash?
You were with Akaash..
..in spite of my saying no.
Sister-in-law, why don't you like if I meet Akaash?
Do you want to get closer to him?
Or are you closer to him?
Anyway, brother is not at home.
Neetu!
Don't you feel ashamed to talk like this with sister-in-law?
Now I will show you what you are doing by staying here.
What have you done?
Stop it!
Sister-in-law, delete it.
What is this..
Sister-in-law, please..
How is the video, sister-in-law?
If you tell me then I will show it to your loving brother.
No..
- He too will feel entertained.
- No, sister-in-law.
Please.
Please don't show to brother.
Please!
What do you want?
You leave this house and go.
And from Akaash's life too.
Okay.
I will leave this house and Akaash forever.
Coming to Akaash, I love him..
..and I will love him forever.
Sister-in-law, you didn't do a good thing with me.
I will remember my humiliation forever.
Neetu is not seen anywhere.
Did she go somewhere?
She didn't go, Akaash.
I told her to go.
But why?
Because she was coming closer to you than me..
..and I couldn't tolerate it.
And you too are very clever.
You were hunting two persons very cleverly at once.
So one of us had to leave.
Are you not feeling sad upon her leaving?
What, dear?
Hey, he was behind me for no reason.
I had no interest in her.
Just think that I was passing time with her.
I love only you.
What if I don't believe?
So I will take you in my arms and make you believe.
What happened, Barkhaa?
Why are you looking at Ranbir's photo?
I received call from army headquarters.
They said Ranbir became a martyr of war.
What?
Ranbir died?
Hope you are not wrong.
My friend Ranbir..
I can't believe it, Barkhaa.
My friend Ranbir is no more in this world?
Yes, you have to believe it.
Barkhaa, whatever he is, he was your husband.
He was your companion and my friend.
Will you not become my companion, Akaash?
What did you say?
There is a famous saying.
Forget what happened.
Forget it.
Look at the future.
And my future is standing in front of me.
Will you not marry me, Akaash?
Wonderful, Barkhaa.
Wonderful.
You are a great cheater!
Husband passed away few hours back..
You didn't shed any tears..
..but you are talking of another marriage.
Don't you feel ashamed?
Someone has to become a companion.
First it was husband, now lover will become husband.
Akaash, do you know..
..that this property worth crores have become mine after Ranbir's demise?
If you marry me then you will gain double benefit.
You will play in crores with me.
Gopu..
- Yes..
I heard madam is going to marry Akaash.
Channu, this is the age of Kali.
Earlier a woman used to mourn for many days after husband's death.
..and our madam is enjoying first night.
This is not marriage.
It is lust.
Lust.
What is lust, Channu?
Dumbo!
Barkhaa..
Are you alive?
Yes, Barkhaa.
I am alive.
But the news of your death...
You believed lies to be true.
You married him?
Barkhaa, had you loved me in real..
..then you would have at least waited for my dead body.
One waits for people who are alive..
..and not dead people.
By the way, what else can I do?
I was very alone after your leaving.
Will I keep crying?
Barkhaa, where will you find time?
because you had to marry this traitor friend of mine.
Ranbir, talk with respect.
Akaash is my husband.
Yes, Ranbir.
Forget what happened, now Barkhaa is my wife.
No, Akaash.
You are wrong.
Barkhaa is wife even today.
Because this soldier is alive.
No, Ranbir.
No.
I think this is your misconception.
I am not your wife.
I agree that the news given was wrong..
..but that news was official.
I believed the news and married Akaash.
Barkhaa, why don't you say..
..that you were enjoying in the arms of him in my absence?
And I never thought that..
..the wife whom I am leaving, I will find her become a betrayer like this.
Akaash, you have buried the faith of friendship.
Enough, Ranbir!
Enough!
Now you are an outsider to me..
..and I am not related to him anyway.
Barkhaa, I understood you entire game.
What did you think?
Did you think that you both will get my entire property after my death?
But it will never happen like that.
As long as I am alive, my wealth can never become yours.
It has become, Ranbir.
If you have any doubt..
..then can you prove in society and also in front of law that you are alive.
And we can prove that you are dead.
Now get out!
Rascal!
You are the mastermind behind this dirty game!
I will not spare your life!
It is better if you leave from here.
Yes!
I am leaving from here!
But you both remember something.
I am a soldier.
A soldier will never forgive his enemy.
He will never forgive!
I love you, Akaash.
I love you.
But I think you forgot me.
But I couldn't forget you, Akaash.
I..
I want to get you..
..forever and ever.
I want to become yours.
But..
..don't know why..
Don't know why..
Barkhaa!
Now my wife!
Barkhaa, you didn't consider my love as love.
Maybe I can forgive you..
..but my soul..
..will never forgive you.
What happened, Barkhaa?
Why did you scream?
Was it a nightmare?
- Yes.
I saw in my dream that Ranbir has killed me.
Akaash, I am frightened.
Ranbir will kill me.
Come on, Barkhaa.
It was a dream.
Dream will never be true.
And Ranbir who is helpless, how can he kill anybody?
Relax!
What happened, brother?
What happened?
Why did sister-in-law do like this to us?
Neetu, even I too didn't think of it..
..that she will do like this to us.
But this bad world has made her too bad.
Now wealth is everything to her.
Brother, wealth is not everything, right?
I cannot bear this pain.
Neetu, don't cry.
Don't cry.
One who inflicted this pain on us..
..I will inflict ten times more pain to him.
Akaash, sometimes dreams also come true.
I think Ranbir must be trying to kill me.
Maybe true.
Anyway, his heart has broken recently.
In such situations, fresh wounds will make a person more dangerous.
Why don't we kill him before he kills us?
It will be fun.
Who kills whom first?
Did you kill my Barkhaa?
You ruined my life.
Whatever she is, she was my wife.
She loved me.
You couldn't see our happiness, right?
I think you must be happy now.
Stop it, Akaash.
Don't show your crocodile tears to me.
If I want then I can kill you too.
But I will not kill you.
Because my loved one has cheated me.
So you want to say that Ranbir killed Barkhaa.
Yes.
So didn't you try to save?
Inspector, when I reached there, that rascal had already killed Barkhaa..
..and escaped from there.
If you want then ask them..
..but get justice to my Barkhaa.
Is it true?
Yes, sir.
Ranbir sir has killed madam Barkhaa..
..and left.
May I know who you are?
I am Barkhaa's husband.
Okay..
So Mr. Ranbir..
He is her first husband.
Okay.
Madam, what about you?
I am Ranbir's sister.. cousin.
Okay..
There are many characters.
There is definitely some story in every character.
It will be fun.
There is some twist in the story.
Interesting.
Akaash, I am so happy.
Now nobody can stop us from loving.
All walls are pulled down... ..which stopped us from meeting.
What are you thinking, Akaash?
Neetu, I agree that I love you.
Now we are married too.
But can I forget Barkhaa.
By the way, she is my..
She was not your wife.
She misled brother.
And now she was misleading you too.
If you had not killed her then I would have killed her.
Akaash, you forget the past memories.
And I am with you in this moment.
We both are together.
Who is it?
- Police.
Police?
- Police?
You are under arrest, Mr. Akaash.
You are arrested for the crime of killing Barkhaa.
Crime of killing Barkhaa?
Inspector, you must know that I didn't kill Barkhaa, Ranbir had killed her.
Interesting.
Will you not come, madam?
You too are involved in this planning.
Come.
Come I say!
Come!
Inspector, you are troubling me unnecessarily.
What proof do you have to say that I killed Barkhaa?
Mr. Akaash, it is that person dies only once, not twice.
And dead person doesn't send message to anybody.
The mobile from which message has been sent..
..that mobile carries your finger prints.
Not me but postmortem report and forensic report says it.
And if this evidence is a lie then I have bigger evidence than that.
See there.
Sir, why don't you say that you killed madam Barkhaa?
Yes, I killed Barkhaa!
I strangled her to death with these hands.
I started hating her..
..because I started loving Neetu.
We both wanted to get married.
And she came in between of our marriage.
We fought over this matter.
Akaash, if you wanted to lie in Neetu's arms then why did you marry me?
You forgot that I am your wife.
I have first right on you.
Shut up, Barkhaa!
Just shut up!
Which right are you talking about?
Your husband had first right on you, I mean Ranbir.
But in order to fulfill your lust..
..you gave that right to me.
You played a fake drama of marriage with me.
Only to fulfill your lust.
But I fell in true love with Neetu.
Now I want to marry her.
Do you want to marry Neetu after being married to me?
I don't trust the marriage in which relationships are not respected.
I want to get rid of you, your body and your bed.
Did you understand?
Akaash!
But I don't agree with this cheating.
You can never get Neetu as long as I am alive.
I strangled her to death after finding a chance in that scuffle.
Interesting.
I don't understand that when you loved Neetu or wished to marry her..
..then why did you marry Barkhaa.
For property worth crores of rupees, Inspector.
Because I knew that Barkhaa became the owner of the property worth crores..
..after Ranbir's death.
That's why I agreed to marry her.
My marrying Barkhaa was love and trust for her, but for me it was just cheating and deceit.
I know that if get rid of Barkhaa..
..then property will be transferred to Neetu easily.
And then the first scene of our script began.
Plan was made on how to get rid of Barkhaa.
Interesting.
But then we came to know that Ranbir was alive.
Neetu will not get property worth crores when Ranbir is alive.
Akaash..
What is the benefit on killing Barkhaa?
Brother is alive.
This is indeed a big problem..
..but we have to do something to get this property.
So what shall we do now?
Neetu, did you hear the proverb..
Two are better than one.
Now not one but two persons should die in this game.
By the way, Neetu, you can see your brother dying, right?
Akaash, if you tell me to dig my brother's grave then I will not step back.
I can do anything to get you.
By the way, if brother stays alive then he will never let us become one.
So believe me that they have to die for sure in this game.
Cheers!
After that we made a new plan.
To frame Ranbir for Barkhaa's death.
To take advantage of their fight.
Property would be taken by getting rid of both of them.
When Barkhaa and I had a fight..
..and in that fight, I found a chance and killed her.
When Gopu saw me then..
..threatened him.
I offered him money to keep it a secret and not tell anybody.
Finally you have seen everything.
Since you have seen it so listen to me carefully.
If you try to tell this secret to anybody..
You too will be sent to your madam.
If you help us by hiding this secret..
..you will get five lakh rupees.
Five lakhs?
No, sir.
I will not tell this matter to anybody.
Good.
And then I lifted Bakhaa's dead body and kept it on the table..
..in such way that if anybody sees it..
..then it would look like a man or woman sitting.
After that I had sent an SMS to Ranbir from Barkhaa's mobile.
It's done.
A message which will make Ranbir restless after reading it..
..and he will come here in anger.
Barkhaa's message?
She is threatening to kill me.
We waited over there.
After some time Ranbir came there.
He found Barkhaa alone and strangled her to death.
He thought he killed Barkhaa.
And then I came out of trees.
I said to Ranbir that he killed my Barkhaa.
And then I called the police.
He escaped from there after hearing about police.
Hello, police?
Ranbir went behind bars like this.
He was languishing in jail in spite of being innocent..
..and we were living a happy life.
But don't know when this rascal Gopu opened his mouth.
He ruined the entire plan.
And we became sure..
..that brother will get death sentence one day for killing sister-in-law Barkhaa.
Interesting.
Wonderful, sister!
Wonderful!
As far as I know, sister prayers for her brother.
You know it, right?
But your innocence had made such a big plan to kill her brother.
I feel ashamed.
It is better to not have a sister than having one like you.
But the servant's honesty and conscience has revealed your intentions.
Mr. Akaash, neither honesty can be threatened nor bought.
Did you understand?
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Rascal!
Do you want to tell Ranbir about my plan?
Didn't I tell you to shut your mouth?
The thing is that the servant revealed the truth.
Inspector, you are right.
Had Gopu not been there..
..then I would have lived like a murderer in spite of being not guilty.
I know whatever Akaash did was his mistake.
Barkhaa too committed mistake..
..because she never understood my responsibility and love.
She joined hands with Akaash and entered into such relationship, you are seeing the consequences of it.
And like this a plan is made to commit a crime.
And then with your friend's wife, illicit relationship, killing..
And also planned to kill your friend too.
Like this, you have been committing mistakes continuously one after other.
My circumstances have forced me to commit this crime.
Ranbir, may I lost the right to call you my friend..
..because I snatched all your happiness.
I cannot return that happiness..
..but I will definitely repent for my crime in this jail.
And I hope you and God forgives me.
What are you watching, brother?
Do you think I will die as single?
Now my father thinks I am grown up.
I got married.
Now I will do that..
No!
No!
I will not tell you, you go.
"Let me love you indefinitely.."
"Why should there be a distance between us?"
"No!
No!
Don't say there is no love on our lips."
"Let me love you indefinitely.."
"Why should there be a distance between us?"
Come on.
Come on, Zeke.
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
Sam.
Sam, wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up.
- Hey...
- Shh.
Go to Oliver's room.
Lock the door.
Don't make a noise and don't come out.
Why?
Someone's in the house.
Come on.
I don't believe in violence.
I just want to say that before we get started here.
I mean, nobody's gonna say they believe in violence, nobody who's not a sociopath, I guess.
But you work in an ER for a while and see all the terrible things people do to each other, you learn to hate it.
And we're cleaning up this mess that starts out there.
We act like people die at the hospital.
Some do, of course, but for most of them, it was a...
There was a time, there was a last moment where they could have been saved.
And that moment's long gone by the time they get here.
Um...
Dr. Elison?
Why don't you have a seat?
We should get things started.
So how does this work... exactly?
I mean, how do you go about...
Evaluating someone's mental state?
Let's start with this.
Why do you think you're here?
Well, it's been a while since my psych rotation, but off the top of my head, I would say, um...
I had an inappropriate response to a clinical situation, possibly indicative of an affective disorder.
How was that?
Dr. Elison, I'm on your side.
My side?
Oh, good.
That's great.
It's good to know we're in this together.
All I'm saying is that I know you have been through a lot, and my job here is just to understand what happened.
Okay.
Let's try this again.
Here's the thing, um, Dr. Laster.
You're the one who decides whether my career as a physician ends today.
So I can tell you what happened, but the why?
That's your call.
Doctor!
You can say I'm fine.
That I'm here because I used an iv stand for a nonstandard purpose.
Get out of my way!
You can say it was an isolated episode and I'm here because I had a hard night and I cracked under pressure.
Ahh!
You can say I'm here because I'm batshit crazy.
- Let's go!
- Get off of me!
- On the ground!
- Argh!
Stay there!
Guess you'll just have to take your pick.
Let's start with a little background.
Married?
Family?
Yes.
My wife, Samantha, is a real estate lawyer.
We have a son, Oliver, who's ten.
We, uh...
We had an eight-year-old daughter, Becky, but we lost her last year.
I'm so sorry.
And how long have you been in emergency medicine?
Uh, ten years.
Listen, uh...
Could we... could we skip this?
I-I know my behavior today was completely unacceptable and I will make whatever apologies are necessary, but...
I need you to understand, I have patients who need me.
So I'm asking you, uh, as a colleague, if...
Dr. Elison,
I appreciate your dedication to your work, but you're here as a patient, not as a colleague.
Tell me what happened on Sunday morning.
Of course.
So while we're waiting on the labs, start her on the antibiotics and check her every 20 minutes.
Okay.
And if her fever doesn't go down?
Come and get me.
If it spikes, run and get me.
Got it?
That's why I wear my running shoes.
- All right.
- Yo, John.
- Can I borrow you?
- What's up?
I have a chest pain waiting, and sadly, we are bed-less.
Can... can five go to subacute?
Nope.
She crashed.
We tubed her.
She's waiting in ICU.
Okay, well, can nine go four and then four go hall?
Have you seen four?
Well, it says "minor laceration."
Yeah, and meth psychosis.
The guy tried to remove glass spiders under his skin with a screwdriver.
If we put him in the hall...
Then the spiders attack again?
- Right.
- Right.
Okay.
Three's due for a ct.
How about three goes up, nine takes her place, three comes back, he goes to subacute eight...
It's full.
I checked.
Yeah, but it's Henry Maxson.
I'll give him some Insulin, and move him into the hall.
That, I believe, gets you your free bed.
Bam.
My man.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. John Ellison is officially tonight's Samaritan hospital bed-Tetris champion.
- Let's hear it.
- Whoo!
Way to go, Doctor.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Yes.
Yes.
Hey, you finish up and get some sleep, okay?
Yup.
Okay.
Gretchen?
Am I interrupting?
I'm pretty sure you know the answer to that question, Doctor.
Yeah, well, finish up.
We got work to do.
Bed eight.
Isn't there a smoke alarm in here?
Maintenance disabled it.
I guess it kept going off.
- Go figure.
- Uh-huh.
Bed eight... that's Henry, right?
Yeah.
How is he?
Well, I guess they didn't cure diabetes in the last couple days, 'cause he still has it.
How's that feel?
- Any pain?
- No, not really.
I haven't had any pain for the last few days.
Is it getting better?
Remember we talked about this last time you came in?
The lack of pain is the problem.
The nerves are damaged.
You been taking your Insulin?
I...
I've been trying, but I ran out of what Dr. Dan gave me last time.
I know it's hard, Mr. Maxson, but you got to keep up with your Insulin shots.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Henry, think it could be time to talk to a surgeon.
No.
N... no, hey, Doc...
That medicine you gave me last time, that worked.
We... we could do that again.
Henry, the gabapentin was for the pain.
It doesn't make anything better.
There's got to be something that... you can do.
I...
I promise, look, I will...
I will follow the diet and the exercise, and I'm gonna do the Insulin every day just like you told me.
I'm not gonna do it halfway this time.
I'm gonna do it all the way.
There's got to be something you can do.
Doc, please, don't take my foot.
We'll try antibiotic therapy a little while longer, but I really...
No, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Doc.
Excuse us a moment.
So vanco one gram iv, okay?
Thanks, Gretchen.
Hey, so I'm moving Henry Maxson into the hall for an Insulin drip and IV vanco.
Can someone check on him in 30?
Another Insulin drip and antibiotics?
Why, exactly?
We're gonna take another run at saving that foot.
Rip off the band-aid, for god's sake.
That foot was toast weeks ago.
Why are we wasting resources on a noncompliant basket case?
So what, you want to dump him in the alley out back?
It's a thought.
I'll keep an eye on him.
Go.
Thanks.
Oh, oh, I think I found something, here, in your tummy.
I don't have anything in my tummy.
Trust me, I'm a doctor.
I think I found something, and I think it's...
It's an octopus.
No.
I don't have an octopus.
I think you do, but hold still.
Maybe I can get it.
John, if you rile up that dog, you're in trouble.
Okay.
Okay.
I was just checking Oliver for octopuses.
All right.
Come here.
Come here.
Give me a hug.
Oh.
- Daddy, you're squishing me.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
Hey, get this dog out of here.
Get out of here, Zeke.
You okay?
Yep, I'm just, uh...
Long night.
I just...
I need some food and some sleep.
Any chance we can get you off nights this year?
I spoke to Jay about it.
He said he'd see what he could do but with all the time I had to take off last year...
I fell off the day schedule.
Yeah.
Here.
Let me get that.
- Oof.
- Ooh.
Tight.
Do you want me to relax you?
- Mm.
- It's been a while.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is that Zeke?
So what?
Let him bark.
Oh, f... wait.
Hold a minute.
Zeke.
Hey, Zeke.
Zeke!
Hey.
What the hell?
Zeke, off.
Off.
Hey.
Leave it.
Leave it.
Is he alive?
He's not moving.
No, he's... he's asleep.
There's an animal rescue downtown I can take him to.
He'll make it, though, right?
He'll... he'll be fine.
Hey, what's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
No, I just...
I was just remembering Becky chasing the squirrels in the back.
Me running after her, trying to keep her shoes tied...
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Baby, just... just breathe.
It'll be okay.
I was doing so well.
And you're... you're still doing well.
God.
No, it's just, looking at that poor little thing there, dying.
He's not dying, Sam.
I'm gonna take him to the animal hospital.
- I'll take him right now.
- Okay.
Hi.
Is there a vet on duty?
I got a squirrel here.
My dog got to it.
I'm bringing it in now.
I'm an M.D., and I gave him some midazolam.
How's his breathing?
Uh...
It's, um...
Actually, I...
I won't be coming in.
Ahh!
Ahh!
Help!
Somebody help!
Help!
Somebody help!
Don't close your eyes, man.
- Don't close your eyes, man.
- Stop!
- Please!
- Stop it!
He's dying!
That dude shot him!
You're pumping an artery.
You're making it worse.
He's dying, man!
Help him!
Call 911.
Tell them we need an ambulance.
Do it right now.
- It hurts.
- I know it hurts.
I know it hurts, but you're gonna be...
You're gonna be okay.
Damn!
They're coming back, man!
They're coming back, man!
You're a lucky man, Dr. Elison.
The guys who were after you, not so much.
We found their car in that parking lot right over there.
Shooter ran off, but the driver's dead.
How did he... what caused it?
Well, we're still determining that, but it appears to be multiple gunshot wounds to the torso.
A... and the... the victim?
Is he...
He's on the way to the hospital.
Which one?
Samaritan?
Does it matter?
I work there.
Yeah.
You may get to spend some more time with him, then.
Now, one of the patrol officers found something in the passenger seat of your car...
The corpse of a small animal.
Can you tell me what that was doing there?
I... it was a squirrel.
My... my dog got to it.
- Squirrel?
- Yeah.
I was taking it to the vet on Edgewood and...
Well, it didn't make it.
I'm so sorry.
Well, look, we're gonna take you in.
Write a full report.
Wait.
Am I being arrested?
So long as everything lines up, you should be done in... a few hours.
All right.
Oh, by the way, there is just one other thing.
You said that the car was up by that lamppost there.
- Right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
About there.
Okay, just... just bear with me for a second here, if you would, because you see, you fired three rounds at a moving car and you hit the driver center mass.
That's...
I mean, that's incredible.
Got any explanation?
I just pulled the trigger.
Just pulled the trigger?
I told you you were a lucky man.
You should buy some lotto tickets.
Watch your head when you get in.
"Just pulled the trigger."
I should try that.
They're coming back, man!
They're coming back, man!
Everything all right?
Never better.
You know, I read the police report earlier.
What you did was very brave.
I imagine it was also quite traumatic.
Traumatic enough to explain what happened today in the er?
Let's not worry about that for the moment.
Just tell me if you remember your feelings at the time.
I...
I wasn't really thinking about my feelings.
No?
I'm surprised.
Between the incident with the squirrel, the loss of your daughter, your wife's reaction...
Obviously, I...
I had a lot on my mind, but, uh...
I was focused on the boy lying on the ground bleeding to death, and I remember thinking that he probably only had a partial arterial transection and I could save him if I could get pressure on it.
And the young man you shot?
What were your feelings about him?
Angry.
Angry he put me in the position where I had to do that.
How am I supposed to feel in that situation?
Guilty?
Uh, sad?
What?
- This isn't a test.
- But it is a test.
You're evaluating me.
What if I had no reaction?
I felt absolutely nothing after killing a 19-year-old kid?
Clearly unhealthy.
And at the other end of the spectrum, say I was completely overwhelmed and stopped functioning.
Unhealthy.
But between the two, there's the perfect mix of pain and dissociation.
It's just right.
So... where's that?
I'm afraid I can't answer that.
Why not?
I can give my patients an optimal O2 sat number or blood pressure range.
Dr. Elison, I don't know how else to put this.
I need to know how you process this trauma.
Do you know what happens after you shoot someone?
Like, what happens next, specifically?
Spend about six hours in a police station.
And it's not a therapeutic environment where you process your trauma.
You all right there, Doc?
We're almost done here.
Yeah.
I, uh, I work late.
I haven't slept much.
How about a cup of our fine police station coffee?
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.
All right.
I don't blame you.
You know...
These binders you've been looking at, these fellas right here are members of Norteños Locos...
Northern Atlanta-based, mostly Mexicans, central Americans.
These guys, they're part of an outfit called Vine City Crew.
They hang out in the area we picked you up at.
And these two binders are fighting each other these days.
So let me ask you a question.
Do you recognize any one of these guys?
- No.
- You're sure?
Well, there was a glare on the windshield and most of the people in the park were running away.
All right, well, it was worth a try.
And I guess that will finish us up.
Your wife's waiting for you in reception.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- Yeah.
Oh, Dr. Elison, just one more thing.
So far, this thing hasn't gotten any play with our friends in the press, which is good, because that just makes our job that much harder.
You plan on talking to reporters?
Oh, no.
No, I'm... why would I...
Well, you know, situations like this, reporters tend to get a little crazy and suddenly, everyone decides that there's a hero in our midst and, well, sometimes, someone decides he wants to be that hero.
That's not you, is it?
No.
No.
No.
That's not me.
Well, good.
You have a nice day.
John.
God.
It's all right.
I'm okay.
Is there anything else in the file, or...
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Thank you so much.
Yeah.
Okay.
Talk to you tomorrow.
Who was that?
A friend in the D.A.'s office.
And?
Told me what he could.
The boy, the one you saved, he's the son of a prisoner in the federal system.
His name is Antoine Tyler.
I also found out about the boy who...
Was shot too.
His name was Raul Mendoza.
Police files have him listed as a known gang associate.
How are you doing?
I think I'm okay.
John, you don't have to be okay.
Sam, I know what happened today was... awful, but...
I can't explain it, exactly, but I feel different, like I can breathe.
And for the first time in a very long time,
I want to go to work.
John, you ready?
Ollie's gonna be late for school.
Be right there.
- This is Dr. Harper.
- Hey, it's John.
Hey, Johnny, listen, I heard what happened.
Now, how are you doing?
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
Hey, I just wanted to check in on the boy who came in yesterday.
You... you worked on him, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, and he's good, as far as I know.
I mean, I didn't have him here too long.
Got him stable and I sent him up to surgery.
- He was all right, though?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I was worried for a little bit, but we got him through.
Great.
Okay.
That's... that's great.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
You're welcome.
- See you soon.
You okay back there?
You want some music?
No, thanks.
Why are you driving me to school?
Usually Mom drives me.
Well, I thought I'd drive you today.
Because of the thing that happened?
Ollie, what do you know about the thing that happened?
You got any questions you want to ask me?
No.
I understand.
What do you understand?
You told me when I got my shots.
When you're a doctor, to help someone, sometimes you have to do something that hurts.
All right.
Hey, I love you.
Yep.
I love you too.
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah.
I wanted to use the gun range.
You just select your weapon.
We have our rentals over here.
We got semiautomatics on top.
Revolvers lower.
Hmm.
Um...
That one.
It's a Beretta model 92.
Are you familiar with the weapon?
No.
Okay.
Hi.
Hey, it's me.
Where are you?
I... uh...
I'm out running errands.
John, your father called.
He's coming over.
All right.
Um...
I'll be... fine.
I'll be home in a few minutes.
Bye.
Hey, Dad.
Thanks for coming over.
You don't have to pretend to be happy to see me.
I'm your father.
I get to worry about you whether you want me to or not.
Yeah.
Guess that's fair.
How you holding up?
Okay.
Going back to work?
Yep.
Tomorrow night.
Sam doesn't want me to, but I got a patient...
Uh, patients I need to follow up with, so...
Talk to a lawyer?
Police seem satisfied.
Yeah, well, that can all change.
People who weren't there second-guessing you.
Happened all the time in 'Nam.
Actually, uh...
I got a...
I got a question about that.
Were you...
Good at it?
Was I good at what?
Was I good at Vietnam?
Oh, I don't know.
Were you good at...
War?
Yeah.
I guess I was.
When I got there, I did what I had to do.
That's pretty much the bar for being a good soldier.
And did you, uh...
Did it bother you?
After?
In my first firefight,
I got stuck behind this dead tree thing, and I'm just staying down, trying not to crap in my pants, and I hear this sound.
I think it's a lieutenant coming to tell us to fall back.
It's two NVA coming out of the jungle 30 feet away.
I shot them both before I could even think about it.
You never told me that.
I never much liked thinking about it.
When did you stop?
Thinking about it, I mean.
Next firefight.
Give it time.
Here.
I want you to have this.
Put that away.
I don't...
I don't want that.
John, you got your wife and my grandson to protect.
This is ridiculous.
I...
I don't want it.
- Put it away...
- Damn it.
Listen to me.
Take it.
Take it and put it someplace safe.
Someplace where you can get to it if you need it.
Take it.
They're coming back, man!
They're coming back, man!
Stop!
Stop the goddamn car!
Please!
Stop!
John?
What?
You were thrashing.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
It's...
I had a dream.
What was it?
It was, um...
I...
I don't remember.
It's okay.
Go back to sleep.
I'm fine.
Okay.
Yep.
Yeah, I'm just getting in now.
It's not too late to change your mind.
I'm not going to change my mind.
It's work, Sam.
It's the same as every other day for the last eight years.
Just...
- Call me later.
Okay?
- And wake you up?
You do not want me to wake you up in the middle of the night.
I do.
That is exactly what I want.
I want you to wake me up in the middle of the night and tell me how you're doing.
- John?
- Yeah.
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I...
look, I love you.
Okay?
Kiss Ollie for me.
Bye.
Bye.
There he is!
Dirty Harry, M.D!
Guys, uh, serious...
This... this is not necessary.
What do you mean?
We got a hero in our midst.
The nursing staff made you a cake.
Show him, Sherry.
Wow!
That's, uh...
Seriously, everyone, uh, thank you.
The cake's amazing.
All right, back to work, everybody, before people start dying on us.
And don't take your cake into a patient care area unless you want drug-resistant staph in your frosting.
Bullet behaved pretty well for a bullet.
Aside from the partial transection of the carotid, there was a pseudoaneurysm on the internal jugular.
How was the lung?
He was aspirating pretty badly by the time the ambulance got there.
Minimal damage to the trachea.
Mild trauma to the right apical segment.
I excised a chunk of the superior lobe.
Bullet came within a centimeter of the aorta, though, so I figured it was a small price to pay.
How much blood did he lose?
How many units did he need?
At least six during surgery.
If you're asking whether what you did at the scene saved the kid, John, yeah, it did.
I should run.
I'll add you to the patient update list, okay?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Doctor?
Yes?
They're asking for you downstairs.
You need a minute?
No.
I'm coming.
So what awaits us on bed nine?
Female, 25.
CC's a broken collarbone.
- Sounds straightforward.
- Does it?
- What?
- You'll see.
Okay.
Tell me again what happened.
I was in the backyard and...
She fell off the porch.
I pressure washed it this morning, and it was still slick this afternoon.
Let's...
let's let her answer please.
Okay.
So the, uh...
The bruises, that's where they came from too?
Y... yeah.
And you're sure you only fell once?
'Cause, you know, you got bruises on both sides of your body.
It's kind of unusual to see that from a single fall.
Okay.
She told you what happened.
Yeah, and I'm just confirming what she said, sir.
Please.
So just one more thing to take care of.
We're gonna need a pelvic exam.
- Wait, what?
- Why?
Yeah, we just need to check.
In rare cases, a fall can cause reproductive harm.
So you can go to the waiting room.
Yeah.
You don't need to get undressed, Hillary.
I just needed a moment alone to ask you a few questions.
If someone's hurting you,
I want you to be able to talk about it freely and confidentially.
I slipped off the porch, like he said.
- You slipped?
- You got a problem?
No.
I...
- Forget it.
- Sorry.
Can we go back to the...
No, I want to hear what she has to say.
What?
He's gonna kill you, eventually.
- You know that, right?
- Gretchen.
How is this your business, bitch?
If you expect us to put you back together after he busts you up,
I'd say it makes it our business!
Let's talk outside.
Excuse us, please.
Hey.
What was that?
Look at her charts.
She's been in here six times in a year...
Concussion, broken nose, ruptured spleen.
She is gonna die, and we're just watching it happen.
Believe me, I want to help her.
The guy's a son of a bitch, no question, but there are procedures for dealing...
Yeah?
Like what?
I got a procedure.
You still have that gun from the other day.
Excuse me?
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.
Are you proposing I...
I shoot the man?
- Why, are you offering?
- No, I am not offering.
Then I guess I was joking.
Just take her up to ct.
- So what was that about?
- Nothing.
Oh, come on.
Spill it.
Are we having another Gretchen incident?
Nothing.
You know they've been trying to fire her for over a year.
Don't feel you have to cover for her.
I said it's fine.
- Didn't look fine.
- Well, it was.
If you say so.
Hey, John, would you check me on something here?
What?
I got a kid in earlier, said he was in a fight.
Does this look like a coup and contrecoup to you?
Could be.
It's hard to tell if that's blood or artifact.
What happened?
He get hit by a board maybe?
Or a bat?
He just said it was a fight.
He's not a talker.
I can't even get him to take his clothes off for a full examination.
He's a mean little sucker.
Won't take off his clothes?
Why?
I don't know, probably just a bad case of recent criminal activity syndrome.
This didn't happen today.
I mean, judging from the tissue damage, the break is at least a day old.
- A day old?
- Yeah.
Maybe two.
Where is he?
That's him.
Came in with a couple guys who said they found...
Triage nurse said...
Either way, he's gonna need a surgical consult.
So we...
John!
John.
- Good evening, Mr. Rodriguez.
- 'Sup?
I hear you won't take off your clothes for the examination.
My colleague here just showed me your... your scans, and, uh, you're in bad shape.
Without a full exam, we're...
I got hurt on my face.
You can see that with my clothes on.
- John, seriously...
- Hold on.
I'll tell you what, how about this?
You tell us exactly how you hurt yourself, and then we'll see about the clothes.
Thought he was my doctor.
We both are.
So how did you hurt your face?
I don't got to talk to you, Doc.
I'm not sure this is...
Mr. Rodriguez,
I'm concerned that the head injury may be causing confusion, and if that's the case,
I'm gonna have to compel treatment.
Yo, what are you talking about?
I'm saying do as I ask, or I'm gonna make you do as I ask.
Nah.
Not gonna happen.
Yes, it is.
Hey, just hang on.
- Get off!
Get off!
- Hey!
Knife!
Ah!
Get off me!
Help me get his arm free.
- Get it.
- I can't get his arm free.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
You okay?
I'm all right.
Did nobody think to search this guy when he came in?
I don't know.
Hey.
Was this for my patient?
Was this for Antoine Tyler?
You came into this hospital to kill my patient?
Is that what this is?
Answer me!
John!
Just cool off.
Dr. Elison.
Dr. Elison.
Is it fair to say at this point that your medical judgment was clouded?
No.
No, I wouldn't say that it was.
You had a confrontation with a patient that wasn't yours.
On behalf of a patient who was.
We're talking about a medical judgment, Dr. Elison.
Let me ask you something.
When I shot Raul Mendoza, was that a medical decision?
I'd have to say no.
Kept my patient alive.
You killed someone.
All right, so what if I'd run away and left Antoine Tyler to die?
Would that have been a medical decision?
Result's the same.
One kid dies.
One kid lives.
The only difference is, it's my patient that dies.
Is that a better outcome?
Firing a gun is not a medical decision.
Okay.
So the gun's the issue.
So what if I stayed in the street and focused on tamponading the boy's carotid?
- Medical decision?
- Yes.
I'd say it is.
In which case I would have died along with my patient.
Two deaths instead of one in either of the previous scenarios.
Wouldn't call that a real victory for medicine, would you?
Touché, Dr. Elison.
Let's get back to Antoine Tyler, since he seems to be in the middle of all of this.
Dr. Laster, I think it's better for all concerned if we just leave him out of this.
Well, unfortunately, I can't do that.
There are patient confidentiality issues.
As there are with any kind of evaluation.
Now please, Doctor.
All right.
If you insist.
I'm saying I believe this patient was involved with Sunday's shooting of Antoine Tyler, yes.
And why do you think that, exactly?
He came in with bilateral orbital fractures, frontal skull fracture, and ethmoid sinus fracture.
All the injuries from a single, forceful blow.
And that means?
Usually, an MVA.
A face full of dashboard.
He was probably the passenger in the car, the one pulling the trigger.
You know, when we interviewed you, you said you couldn't see the passenger.
I couldn't.
Look, all I know is, he knew me, he was armed, and he seemed very intent on staying that way.
I guess I can get a forensics unit there in the morning.
We'll check him against what we found in the car.
Tomorrow morning?
Doc, we've had a very busy night.
If I have to ask you any more questions, I'll give you a call.
You be careful, okay?
Yeah.
How's that feel?
It's fine.
Thanks.
Hey, man, we need to talk.
Want to tell me what the hell that was back there?
I'm sorry.
I just...
I went in to talk to the guy, and things got out of hand.
Now, look, I understand you're under a lot of pressure, John, but, Jesus, that was my patient there.
You're talking about compelling treatment?
You had no grounds for that.
What if he complained?
I think if you bring a gun into a hospital, you lose your right to complain.
All right, just go home, and then we'll talk about this later.
I'm not going home.
I can't.
Uh, yeah, actually, you can.
That's what people do when they get stabbed at work.
I didn't get stabbed.
I got cut.
Okay.
My mistake.
You know what people do when they get cut at work?
They go home.
I said I'm not going home, Dan!
Hey, listen, maybe it's not my place to tell you this, but I think you're taking this whole thing a little personally, John.
For a sec, I was actually worried you were gonna shoot that guy.
Dr. Elison, we got a situation in the waiting room.
Hey.
What's going on?
Those guys out there, they came in with Dr. Sherman's patient, the guy who cut your arm.
What are they doing?
They keep trying to come in.
They're not just in emergency, either.
Security stopped a couple of them in the east wing.
They found a guy in pediatrics.
Okay.
Did we talk to the police?
Yeah, I guess there's some kind of big thing going on across town.
- What?
What?
- Some kind of shooting.
They said they could get to us when they can get to us.
What about security?
I told Lewis and the others to lock the front area down, but they ain't the cops.
We can try to declare an internal emergency, send everybody we can along to Grady, but at this hour...
Do it.
Doctor, I'm supposed to call administration...
They got a problem, they can talk to me.
Just do it.
- Tell me if anything changes.
- Okay.
John, everything all right out there?
I think so.
For now anyway.
How's the arm?
Well, I'm not gonna bleed to death anytime soon.
Good.
Listen, I wanted to talk to you about a patient.
- Okay.
Who?
- Henry.
Your pet diabetic with the dry-gangrenous left foot.
He's back in already?
Yep, he came in about an hour ago while you were in with knife guy.
He's in bad shape.
He tore open the foot.
Some kind of work accident, although, how he was even standing on it, I have no idea.
Yeah, he's got some kind of warehouse job.
Well, in any case, the cellulitis is now nec fasc.
He's septic and in DKA.
It has to come off now.
I, uh...
Need you to talk to him.
What is it?
He didn't take the news well.
Dr. Armstrong is in surgery for the next six hours, so I set up a transfer to the Ansley Surgical Center.
They're prepping the or now.
He says he doesn't want to go.
I said he had to.
Kind of left it there.
I'll see what I can do.
Hey, Henry.
Henry?
Hey.
Code blue.
Code blue!
I need a nurse in here!
Nurse!
Code blue, ER.
Code blue, ER, stat.
Get the code cart.
I need Dr. O'Neill in here now.
- Dr. O'Neill!
- Get him atropine.
When was the last time you were in here?
15 minutes.
Maybe 20.
Did you give him any medications?
Nothing.
He just wanted some water.
Sherry.
Sherry.
There.
Check those.
See what he took.
Digoxin, metoprolol, ativan, lisinopril, Norco.
Whoa, oh.
What happened?
Your patient OD'd on bed 15's meds is what happened.
He was fine!
I looked in on him.
You told a guy you were cutting off his foot, and you left him alone.
- Ventilator.
Let's go.
- Pacers, please.
Get a second large bore iv in his ac.
Tell pharmacy to get some Digibind and hang some dopamine.
Pacers, please.
Come on, come on, come on.
- Ready.
- Start pacing him.
We getting anything?
It looks like a block.
You give him the atropine?
- Yes. 1 amp.
- The pacer's not capturing.
Narcan, calcium, and glucagon...
Still nothing.
Nothing.
- Initiate CPR.
- Come on.
Hold CPR.
Check for rhythm.
Come on!
John, I...
For what it's worth, I was aware he was upset.
- That's why I talked to you...
- It wasn't your fault.
He did what he did.
Did he have any family?
No.
He used to talk about that when he was in here.
The paperwork, do you want me to...
I called the code.
I'll do it.
Henry Maxson, 28-year-old diabetic male.
I discovered the patient unresponsive and cyanotic.
I initiated CPR and dosed...
Dosed atropine, one milligram iv.
- Doctor.
- Yeah.
Uh, is something...
Yeah, just, uh, give me a minute, please.
Um, uh, the thing is, there's a phone call for you.
Who is it?
He won't say, but it sounds important.
But I think you should take it.
Hello?
Is this Dr. Elison?
Yes.
W... who am I speaking with?
I...
I said, who am I...
The boy you saved...
I'm his daddy.
Um... what can I do for you?
Tonight, a Mexican dude came up into the hospital.
- He cut you.
- Yes.
- H... how did you...
- You know why he was there?
I think he was there to kill your... your son.
That's right.
The others, the ones outside, they're gonna be coming in to do what he didn't do.
He's safe here.
There's security.
No.
You listen to me, Doctor.
That ain't gonna stop these men.
They got a job to do, and they mean to do it.
They're gonna be up in that hospital tonight.
W... what... what do you...
What do you want from me?
What you think I want?
I want you to save him.
Antoine dies tonight, we gonna have a problem.
I'll try.
You do that, Doctor.
You do that.
I got to go.
Wait.
I...
Nurse.
Nurse.
Gretchen!
Remember the patient from earlier, the one with the...
The fractured clavicle?
Yeah, you mean the one who slipped?
- Yeah, I remember that one.
- Is she still here?
Yeah, she's up in Radiology.
I got the...
Gretchen.
I got the sense that she meant something to you.
What if we could help her?
If her blood work came back positive for signs of meningitis, we could get her into isolation, away from the boyfriend, get a social worker in there, maybe save her life.
Why would her blood work come back positive for meningitis?
Because her doctor said it did.
Interesting.
Why would her doctor do this?
I need your help.
I need to get Antoine Tyler out of this hospital now.
It needs to happen without anybody knowing.
Okay, well, he's a sick kid.
Where do you propose to put him?
Henry Maxson was scheduled to go to Ansley Surgical Center, but the hospital doesn't know that.
I ran the code, called it, but it's not in the computers yet.
If we switch Antoine's records with Henry's, you can get him down to transport.
They can get him over to Ansley under Henry's name.
And when he lands at Ansley?
Well, they'll discover that he's not a 28-year-old diabetic.
He'll become a John Doe with a gunshot wound, and... and he's not in the system.
Until Ansley cross-references the records and puts it together five minutes later.
And besides, I can't just wheel him out in front of security.
Gretchen, the boy is going to die tonight if I don't do something.
There has to be a way.
I didn't say there wasn't a way.
I said your way won't work.
Hey, it's Dr. Elison.
I got some lab results back on patient farmer.
She came in with a fractured clavicle, but we found some nuchal rigidity, and along with her headaches, it looks like meningitis.
Seriously?
Viral?
Probably bacterial.
So let's do an LP and call Infectious Diseases about, you know, getting her admitted ASAP.
The lab results are in the computer.
All right.
I'll get on it right away.
Thanks.
Doctor!
- Move!
- Hey!
Whoa!
Are they still here?
John, what are you...
Are they still here?
Doctor, is everything okay?
- I got to get out there, Lewis.
- Remember, it's locked down.
- Let me through!
- I can't let you do that.
- Come on, man!
- I can't let you do it!
Doctor, just calm down.
Okay?
You don't want to go out there.
Get out of my way!
Get out, all of you.
I know why you're here.
You want to hurt somebody?
Hurt me.
Better watch how you talk.
Might just get what you ask for.
Ahh!
All units to ER waiting room!
I repeat, all units to ER waiting room!
Copy that.
Kick his ass!
Mia at Samaritan hospital in the emergency room.
S... send somebody here now, please!
- On the ground!
- Argh!
Henry Maxson going to Ansley Surgical Center.
Mm-hmm.
All right, let's move him.
This ain't over!
Let me go.
It was...
Dr. Elison, you got to calm down.
You should be out there dealing with them.
Stop it now, or we have to cuff you.
You understand?
All right.
All right.
I'm done.
- I'm done.
- Let's go.
So Antoine Tyler...
Did not disappear into thin air.
No.
And your breakdown...
Was either less severe than you thought or a lot more severe.
Let me know if you figure that out.
You realize I have to report this.
Do you know what that will mean?
Do you?
I know that that is not what you wanted to hear, but your mental state is out of...
This is not about me.
This is about you understanding what your decision today means for patient Tyler, currently recovering at Ansley Surgical Center.
That is not relevant to this evaluation...
It is all that is relevant.
He is a patient in my care.
This is criminal behavior, Dr. Elison, and under the circumstances,
I cannot recommend that you return to work, much less see patients.
I'm sorry if that is not an acceptable outcome for you, but...
Let me finish!
You took an oath to do no harm, just like I did, Doctor.
So let's...
let's talk about harm.
If you report everything you've heard today, this is what's going to happen:
I will lose my job, and I will be unable to protect Antoine Tyler, and the men looking for him will find him, and they will kill him.
Is that an acceptable outcome?
No.
I think that's all we have to talk about then.
Dr. Elison?
I just want to say one thing before you go.
In my practice, I counsel a lot of doctors on the risks they have to take to help people.
I have to tell them to accept that some measure of playing god is necessary to do the job.
But there's a reason we confine that to the practice of medicine.
It protects them, and it protects you.
You take that outside the hospital, and there will be complications.
Good luck.
So...
What did the psychiatrist say?
Says I get to keep my job.
That's good.
I'm glad.
Um, did she say anything else?
What do you mean?
I mean, did she say anything about you?
About why this happened?
No, it's... it's settled.
There's nothing for you to worry about.
John, you attacked a room full of people.
- No one was seriously hurt.
- Oh, okay.
So what, it's just a little misunderstanding?
We're just gonna forget about it?
- It's over.
- No.
You can do that at the hospital, but you don't get to do that with me.
Okay?
I am your wife.
I need to know.
I don't... w... what do you want from me?
I want the truth!
I want you to talk to me.
Something happened the other day in that street.
Something changed in you, and I need to know what it is.
Sam, you can read the psych report...
If you want.
It says I'm okay.
It says I came through something really hard, but I came out the other side, and I'm okay.
You promise?
I promise.
Come on, Zeke.
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Sam?
Sam, wake up.
Wake up.
- Hey...
- Shh.
Go to Oliver's room.
Lock the door.
Don't make a noise, and don't come out.
Why?
Someone's in the house.
Come on.
Remember me?
From the park.
That's right.
What are you doing here?
We need to know how the little man's doing.
Antoine?
He's fine.
Yeah?
What's that mean?
He's in a surgical facility.
For now, he's fine.
Good.
That's real good.
You make sure he stays that way.
- Is that all?
- Not quite.
You know them punks at the hospital?
The ones you messed with?
You don't got to worry about them no more.
Keep this on you.
There's a number on that phone.
You need something, anything, you call it.
I don't need anything from you.
Then don't call.
Have a good night, Doc.
Ready to go, baby girl?
No, I'm not.
Please, sweetie.
I want to go home.
Please.
Becky, we just want you to get better.
You've been so brave.
I can't.
John, I uh...
I know, it's okay.
Rebecca...
Sweetheart, do you remember we talked about this?
About how the medicine works?
It makes you sick so it can make you better.
And it will make you better.
But it hurts so much.
Yeah, I know it does.
But I'm your dad.
And I will be right there with you.
Punk.
There's my brave girl.
Watch your head.
Oh, you're getting heavy.
Okay.
Ollie, there's nothing to worry about.
It's over.
Okay?
You sure?
The police are here.
This is the safest house on the street now.
I promise.
Okay?
Go downstairs, tell your mom I'll be right there.
All right?
- Hello?
- It's John.
What is it?
I thought we were gonna talk tomorrow.
That boy we moved today, Antoine Tyler, what's his status?
He's fine.
He's at Ansley.
I went over like we talked about and told him not to talk anyone.
John, the police need to talk to you.
Doctor?
Talk?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
What the hell is going on?
Some men broke into my house.
Antoine's father sent them.
I needed to see if he was okay before I talk to the police.
You're gonna talk to the police?
You cannot do that!
Are you listening?
They broke into my home.
They murdered two of the men I fought at the hospital and showed me pictures of the bodies.
I have to talk to the police.
Why do you think they showed you those pictures?
It's a warning.
We have a plan and this does not change it.
If you want your family safe, you keep your mouth shut.
... And then they ran off.
So I checked the house and that's when you guys got here.
So you heard a noise from the master bedroom.
You came down the stairs and you said you called out to them.
Do you remember what you said?
I, uh...
There's a number on that phone.
If you need something, anything, you call it.
Sir?
Sir?
I asked if you spoke to the intruders.
Um, yes, yes.
So I came down the stairs, thought I heard them in that room, so I went in and I said, "who's there," maybe?
Something like that.
And they must have come through that room and right out the front door.
Can you tell us anything at all about them?
Height?
Race?
No, no.
I wish I could give you more.
It just happened so fast.
I didn't see anything.
No, you're not listening to me.
I want to talk to the doctor.
I heard you and I will say it again,
I am a doctor.
No!
No.
I wanna talk to my girlfriend's doctor.
You're not him.
No.
Bring that guy out here.
No!
That's not how it works.
And your girlfriend is not down here.
She's in an isolation unit with bacterial meningitis.
Then why didn't she call me?
Huh, smart guy?
I don't know.
That's a tough one but if you give me a sec,
I bet I could come up with a good reason.
Her, right there.
That's that nurse that was with that doctor.
Can I just talk to her for a second?
No you can't, no you can't look...
Don't touch me, man.
Whoo, I'm doing my best to walk the walk here but even the lord, he had his limits.
You need to leave.
Right now.
Hey!
Gretchen, glad I caught you.
I need to talk to you for a moment.
Talk away, Doctor.
Right.
So the thing is...
I got the job of looking into John's cases from the night of his incident.
I guess admin is worried about law suits.
Just wanted to ask if there's anything we should know.
Anything like what?
Uh, just if John made any questionable choices that night, maybe violated a policy.
You worked on a number of patients with him, so...
As far as I saw, he was normal.
Well, he attacked a room full of people, so that might be a stretch.
Uh, just let me know if you remember anything, okay?
You got it.
Shit.
So people break into our house in the middle of the night, the police just check it out, and then leave?
I'll call the alarm company today.
We'll get a system installed.
Is that really gonna be enough?
I mean, you shot a gang member, what...
What if they were here to hurt us?
They're...
I don't think...
It'll be all right.
What?
Last night, when we were talking to the police, did you really not see anything?
I mean, how is that possible?
You know what?
Forget it.
Hey, hey.
Come here.
Don't worry.
I'll keep this family safe.
What's wrong?
Nothing, sweetie.
Mom and Dad were just talking.
Am I going to school?
Yes, of course.
I'm so sorry.
Okay, yeah, let's go.
Have a good day at school.
- Okay, buddy?
- Okay, bye, Dad.
Bye.
I'll see you later.
I'm sure everything will be fine.
It will be.
Okay, let's go.
You're gonna be late, I'm gonna race you.
Gretchen.
Right on time.
Yeah, I almost wasn't.
I had a little trouble finding this...
What is this place?
The last remaining approved smoking area in the hospital.
Oh, well, it's charming.
You got the papers?
I need to head over to Ansley.
There you go.
Okay, Malcolm Akers, 11 years old, admitted to Ansley Surgical Center.
Thoracic trauma of unknown origin?
Is this a fake medical record?
Uh, yeah.
If you want him in the system at Ansley Surgical Center, this is the way to do it.
Anyway, you have much bigger things to worry about.
What?
Bridget is asking about your cases from the other night, including a certain meningitis patient who's up in isolation without any actual bugs in her spinal fluid.
Hillary farmer, right.
Yeah.
- I'll talk to her.
- No, no...
No, I can do it.
You sure?
You just get over to Ansley with that, okay?
I gotta go.
Good luck.
When it gets to this type of consistency,
I'm gonna add a cup of wine.
It's gonna help it set.
Be careful when you're doing it...
I'm Nurse Polk.
We met a few days ago in the er.
Yeah, I remember.
Do you know why you're in isolation?
They say I got meningitis.
Well, you don't.
You have fractured clavicle that your boyfriend gave you.
The meningitis diagnosis was to get you here.
What do you want?
A doctor's gonna come by and ask you some questions.
You need to tell her that you felt nauseous, with a stiff neck, and a headache when you came in.
I wrote them down here for you, okay?
You want me to lie?
Seriously?
What is that supposed to mean?
I've seen your medical records.
You've lied about every injury you've had for, like, two years.
I am trying to help you.
I didn't ask for your help.
No, you just needed it.
Hillary, if you want to stay here, you have to...
I don't have to do anything.
I get it.
You don't like me.
That's just fine because I don't like you much either.
But I do know what you're going through.
You're overwhelmed.
You're not sure what to do.
You don't anything about me.
Get out of here.
Get out!
Everything okay in here?
Yes.
She was just leaving.
Hi, can I help you?
Hi.
Yeah, I'm from Samaritan hospital.
I'm checking on a patient.
Oh, the charts are over there.
Thanks.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You gotta sign in.
Right.
Excuse me.
What's up?
The patient I'm looking for, he's and African-American male, 11 years old.
Oh, the Doe?
Yeah, he's in room 219.
Is he scheduled for any procedures today?
Or any tests?
No.
Why do you ask?
Oh, I just wanted to talk to him about his, um...
Physical therapy.
Are you sure he couldn't have gone out for...
He's in his room.
All day, all night.
How's that cart coming?
I'm coming down there, mama, easy.
Look, I gotta check the kid's fluids in about a half hour or so.
You can meet me in the room if you'd like.
But he's pretty sedated.
Ramon.
I gotta go.
I want to go home.
It hurts so much.
Punk.
I'm your dad and I'll be right there with you.
After completing this last round of chemo, the test results came in, and I'm afraid the cancer's progress hasn't slowed.
Oh, god.
That isn't...
You said the regimen was effective.
And it is, in about 85% of cases.
But we had a plan here.
Even the best treatment plan can fail.
So that's it?
Chalk it up to bad luck?
My little girl becomes one of the unlucky few, in a very, very effective treatment protocol?
We have our answer, it didn't work.
That's not good enough.
I know but it's not Dr. Kelly's fault...
I don't accept that.
There's nothing we can do.
No!
Please.
Oh, god, please.
So you still wanna split the zoning initiatives by NPU's?
Yeah, it'll be quicker.
We just need to make sure it doesn't all look like high density development.
Okay, well, we can push Wilton's people to finish the public park proposal by Monday.
Maybe you could take the lead on that?
Sam?
Hmm?
Are you all right?
Yeah, you know, I'm so sorry,
I just remembered that I've got some business across town so I'm gonna meet you back at the office, okay?
All right.
I'll see you later.
Okay, bye.
Sam?
Hi.
It's good to hear from you.
How are you doing?
Um, not great, actually.
I'm down at city hall and I thought maybe you might have a minute to get coffee?
Yeah, just tell me where.
Hey.
Hello, gorgeous.
I love what you're doing with your hair.
You got the tangle and the little highlight.
Shut up and let me in.
Yes, Nurse, those files should be right here.
Hydro?
Oh, nice.
Cancer patient tanked in the er.
He doesn't need them anymore.
What do you want?
I need you to change the attending physician on a patient record.
That's a new one.
Is this for the kid I made the records for?
No, something else.
Jesus, Gretchen, you're asking for a lot of favors this week.
It's a favor when you do it for free.
You do it for 250 milligrams of hydrocodone, it's a job.
Yes or no?
Yeah.
All right.
Who's the patient?
Hillary farmer.
She came in on Tuesday night.
Yeah.
She's one of Dr. Elison's.
How did you know that?
You know that one doctor?
Kind of, like, bitchy-hot one?
Dr. O'Neill?
Yeah, she pulled the file about an hour ago.
Along with a bunch of his other cases.
Shit.
I mean, I can still do it, if you want.
Forget it, it's too late.
Gretchen, what about the hydro...
Can I?
Whatever, you'll owe me.
Okay.
Nurse, hey!
I want to talk to you.
I said I want to talk to you.
I liked that little stunt you pulled in the er, it was charming.
I'm here to see my girlfriend.
Where's Hillary?
She's in isolation with an infectious disease.
Okay?
She's sick.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
There was nothing wrong with her when I brought her in.
You sure about that?
'Cause if I remember correctly, she had a fractured clavicle and a shit ton of bruises.
Okay.
I'm gonna make this really simple for you.
I want you to take me to her, and I want you to take me to her, right now.
Max.
Hey, Max.
You heading to the Ed?
Let me help you there.
My name's Matt.
Oh yeah, that's what I said.
Keep walking.
Yeah?
It's me.
We have a problem.
What?
It's Antoine.
He is not here.
What are you talking about?
He's not where?
Anywhere.
His chart says he's supposed to be in bed, sedated.
But he's not.
Okay, are you sure?
Could he be in Radiology, or...
Gretchen, Gretchen, I just spent the last half-hour checking the procedure rooms.
I am telling you, something is wrong.
Okay, okay.
Do you have a way to get ahold of the gang?
Are you insane?
I can't call them.
What the hell else are you gonna do?
If they came and took him, you need to know that.
Do you understand who I'm dealing with?
They kill people.
Doctor, I get it.
They'll be pissed if they find out he's gone.
But think about how pissed they'll be if he's gone and you don't tell them.
Gretchen, uh, a little help here.
It's your call.
You're the MD.
Make a decision.
Hello?
What you need?
Who is this?
This is the man you called.
Okay, uh, I need to know something.
Is there a way to, um, reach Antoine's family?
The only family Toine's got's in prison.
Okay, well, maybe a social worker, or a teacher?
Ain't no one like that.
Why you asking?
I, uh...
Why don't I call you back?
I said why are you asking me?
I'm at Ansley Surgical Center and I've had some trouble locating him.
You saying you lost him?
No.
I just wanted to check to see if someone picked up him.
Someone who was looking out for him.
Doc, you was the one looking out for him.
Don't go nowhere.
Excuse me, sir?
We spoke earlier, what's your name?
Ramon.
Yeah, you're here for the kid in 219, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was just headed down there.
Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I was just in 219 and he's not there.
Really?
Really.
Nah, that doesn't make any sense.
The kid's snowed on lorazepam.
Yeah, listen to me.
I think he may have been taken from the hospital.
By people who mean him harm.
Jesus, are you serious?
Yeah.
So is there a security here or someone we could talk to?
Yeah, yeah.
There's an office on the first floor.
Okay, we need to go there.
Now.
Okay.
So the police, they have no idea who these intruders were?
No, I'm not sure they care much.
They filed a report and left.
But you think it has something to do with what John did.
Yeah, I mean, how could it not?
John's telling me not to worry about it, but he killed a gang member, attacked a bunch more, and then this happens?
Kyle, I hate to ask you this, but with your connections in the DA's office, is there anything you can do?
Like, is there witness protection for something like this, or...
Ah.
I can ask, but it's set up for informants in drug cases.
Honestly, I just think it would put you in more danger.
Oh.
Well, it was worth a thought.
Look, I'll do what I can.
I know the deputy chief of police pretty well.
Thank you.
Hey, Sam.
It's really good to see you.
I've really missed you.
Kyle, I can't.
I just...
It was unfair of me to come to you.
I should go.
And where did they find this one at again?
Outside a library at Georgia tech.
Now, who gets this wasted and then goes to a library?
EMTs said she was in a flowerbed.
Could've been there for the flowers.
Hey, Lisa?
Are you with us?
Look.
It's pretty.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
Lisa, listen, can you tell me what you took this morning?
Up here, Lisa.
Listen to me, okay?
What did you take?
Was it pills?
What do you think?
I think we could probably smoke this and have a fun few hours.
Let's get the tox screen.
It's probably the safer way to find out.
Gretchen, a patient's asking for you up in isolation.
Farmer?
That's the one with the boyfriend in the waiting room this morning.
You know, he was asking about you.
Oh?
I don't remember him.
Really?
Guy was hard to forget.
I thought he was gonna take a swing at me.
It was a little scary.
But hey, the righteous got nothing to fear, right?
Amen.
You wanted to talk?
Well, I'm supposed to be down in the ED, so if you want to...
Ten grand.
Excuse me?
You and that doctor lied.
You want me to cover for you?
Ten grand.
Are you being serious?
You're a nurse.
He's a doctor.
It's not that much money.
You're actually trying to blackmail me.
Call it what you want.
But you'll lose your job if I tell them.
We were trying to help you.
You have been in and out of the hospital half a dozen times.
I don't care.
I need the money.
You want to screw over the one person who actually gives a shit about you?
Go for it.
Because I'm not giving you anything.
Check the drive.
We're looking for an 11-year-old African-American male, about 4' 5".
Check for the last hour and a half.
Okay, we need to get all his information and there's a form that you gotta fill out.
A form?
Come on, man.
We gotta find him.
Okay, just give me a second.
I got a kid his age.
Mateo.
Something like this, it's your worst nightmare.
You got any kids?
Yeah, I have a son and a, um...
A daughter.
There.
Just check his charts, get everything you can.
Okay.
This is crazy.
I mean, you're just living your life and you forget that stuff like this can happen, you know?
Yo, what you mean he's not here?
I'm sorry, sir.
He's not in the system.
Hey, uh, I gotta go make a call but I'll be right up, all right?
You got it, man.
Let's take a walk.
You didn't need to come.
I'm handling it.
Well, that ain't how it works.
You got something more important to do?
No.
Where are we going?
Right here.
Hey, Doc, here's a little advice.
The man inside?
Tell him the truth.
So what's the word?
I'm sorry, who are you?
Name's Darius.
I run things for easy.
That's Antoine's daddy.
We're still figuring out exactly what happened to Antoine.
Figuring out what happened?
Man, you know what neighborhood this is?
We half a mile from rock Springs!
Locos own all that shit.
The same locos that put a bullet in Toine's chest.
You rolled that boy into the goddamn lion's den.
Hey!
I killed a man to protect Antoine.
I risked my job, my reputation, and my life.
All of it... all of it!
...
To keep him safe.
So don't...
Damn, CJ, he's spicy.
So what's the situation now?
We're reviewing the security footage.
We can contact the police.
Cops?
What good is that gonna do us?
If he gone, he gone.
All that's left is to find out who took him and make the guns clap.
Yo, you was talking to that Mexican dude inside.
No, no, no, he's just a nurse who works at the hospital.
Just saying, he could've talked to a loco.
Shit, maybe he's one of 'em.
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just wait.
That guy, he doesn't know anything.
He's just a guy doing his job.
He was helping me look for Antoine.
Come on.
Doesn't make sense.
I'll tell you what don't make sense.
Going back to Toine's pops empty-handed.
But all right.
You like this nurse so much, you go get him.
Bring him out.
We'll have a conversation here.
Hey, I've been going over his chart.
Last time I check on him, he was in his bed and sedated.
I should've been watching him, man.
I need to tell you something.
There are some men outside and they want to know what happened here.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Who's outside?
Just listen.
I need you to think.
Did anyone talk about the boy in this room, or take a special interest in him, maybe?
Special interest?
Yeah, everybody did.
The kid had no visitors.
Not a single one, man.
Look, whatever happened to him before he got here...
Must've been bad.
I mean, he was scared.
He tried to fight everybody off when he woke up.
Fight everybody off?
I thought you said he was sedated.
Well, that's why he was sedated.
He tore is wound open when he was thrashing around.
That's why they snowed him.
What?
What is it?
I think...
I think he might've woken up.
No way, man.
He was on enough lorazepam to knock me out.
Yeah, except most of it never made it into his arm.
Look, there's a break in the line.
Jesus.
You think he's...
If he did wake up, he would've been scared, and he would've tried to hide.
He might still be here.
You've reached the voice-mail of Dr. John Ellison.
Really?
Gretchen, hey.
Hey!
I need some help with one of the patients you worked on with John.
Girl came in with a fractured clavicle.
Somehow wound up in isolation for meningitis?
Yeah, came in with a break and the infection just showed up.
Well, the doctors upstairs re-ran the CSF and it didn't show any signs of infection.
Hmm.
False negative, maybe?
Or maybe John screwed up.
I'm going to talk to the patient.
I want you to verify her story's the same as when she came in.
I was thinking we'd do this now, Gretchen.
Of course.
This won't take long.
I just want to clear up some things about your visit to the emergency department.
What about it?
Well, it's just that your triage note lists shoulder pain as your only complaint.
So?
Well, it's unusual to have fracture with an unrelated infection this severe.
Did you tell your doctor about any other symptoms?
Miss?
Yeah.
A sore neck.
Fever.
Headache.
All right, any reason you told Dr. Elison but not the nurse at the front desk?
I don't know.
I don't like nurses much.
Okay then.
I'll let you rest.
I'll be right down with her chart.
Thank you.
I really could've used that ten grand.
I hope you're happy 'cause you were right.
I don't know what to do.
Hillary, you cannot go back to your boyfriend.
I know that, I just...
He's been my whole life for five years.
I got no money, no place to go, he's got my car, my stuff.
I'm just so screwed.
Hillary, tell me where you live.
I'll get your stuff.
Check that room.
I'll check the other one.
All right.
Are there any other rooms we haven't checked?
Any other places... that's everything.
No, no, no.
It can't be.
Where does that go?
That's the loading dock.
It's used by the cleaning crew.
They keep it locked.
Antoine?
See that right there?
Yeah.
Oh no.
No.
Antoine?
Oh no!
Jesus!
Set?
Yeah.
Toine, can you hear me?
He has a pulse.
He's breathing.
You're gonna be okay, kid.
Let's get him upstairs.
Just hold still.
Try not to roll over on that, okay, buddy?
Hey, while your pops is gone, it's my job to look out for you.
You know that, right?
So you gotta do is rest up and stay here.
I wanna go home.
You'll be back on the block real soon.
You see that man right there?
He's a doctor.
He's got your back.
He's gonna make sure you're safe.
So no more running off, a'ight?
Okay.
And if anybody asks, your name is Malcolm.
And you're from Kirkwood.
And that's all you say.
We good?
Hey, Nurse.
You make sure he got what he needs.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, can we talk?
Talk then.
Privately.
I can't do this.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means I'm done.
I can't be involved anymore.
You're done, huh?
Yeah.
Antoine's stable now.
I mean, he opened up that wound pretty bad, but he...
You know what happened when word of all this shit today hit the streets?
Couple of my young bangers got carried away.
They wanted to show Antoine's pops that they got his back.
They capped a loco.
You want out?
Hell, we all do.
Tell you what.
There's a Sunny's Diner at Marietta and 8th.
Be there tomorrow at 11:00 A.M., we'll talk about it.
I can't.
Maybe that sounded like I was asking.
I wasn't.
See you tomorrow, Doc.
See you tomorrow.
Have a good one.
So?
It's handled.
You sure?
Yeah, I still have to help her get her stuff from her ex, but she will not be a problem for us at the hospital.
How'd it go over at Ansley?
We found Antoine.
He's gonna be all right.
You don't look very happy about that.
There was another gang shooting.
Someone died all because, for just a few hours,
I couldn't find Antoine.
That's not your fault.
Oh, well, that's a comfort.
Doctor, seriously, you're not responsible.
One way or another, that was gonna happen anyway.
What do you think my job is, Gretchen?
Everything I do is to stop something that was going to happen anyway.
Everything.
I'm a doctor.
I'm the one who stands in the way of nature taking its damn course and stops it.
If it's not my responsibility, then whose is it?
The police officer outside, does he have his gun?
Well, I think they carry those with them everywhere.
So probably, yeah.
Would he shoot someone if they came to our house?
I think the idea is that with him there, nobody will come.
Mmm.
Yum.
Banana pancakes.
I mashed up the bananas.
Oh, my own personal chefs.
You see our new friend stationed outside?
Yeah and I feel safer already.
I'm surprised.
I asked the police when they were here but...
Oh friend in the DA's office pulled some strings.
Oh, that's a nice friend to have.
Anyone I know?
Kyle Hawkins.
I met him in the counseling group last year.
He heard what happened and reached out to the deputy police chief.
Huh.
Well, we should thank him.
Maybe get him a bottle of wine or something.
Yeah, that's a great idea.
I'll stop by the store and pick something up.
Hey, I know we don't normally do this, but can we just...
Yeah.
Lord, we ask that you bless this food and this family.
We've had some hard times lately.
We know you send us only the challenges that we can handle.
And we know that you send us these challenges, Lord, to make us stronger and better able to serve you.
Amen.
Amen.
Work?
Yup.
Sorry.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
What's going on?
Where are you?
Home.
Why?
I went over to Hillary's boyfriend's place to get her things and...
And what?
Something happened.
And you're not gonna like it.
What?
What are you talking about?
How soon can you get here?
[Thunder crashing]
[Rain falling]
(Man) Come on.
[Dog barking]
[Sighs]
Come on, Zeke.
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
[Dog barking]
[Thunder crashing]
[Clattering]
[Dog barking]
Sam.
Sam, wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up.
- Hey...
- Shh.
Go to Oliver's room.
Lock the door.
Don't make a noise and don't come out.
Why?
[Distant thud]
Someone's in the house.
Come on.
[Metallic clinking]
[Floorboard creaks]
[Click]
[Sirens wailing in distance]
I don't believe in violence.
I just want to say that before we get started here.
I mean, nobody's gonna say they believe in violence, nobody who's not a sociopath, I guess.
But you work in an ER for a while and see all the terrible things people do to each other, you learn to hate it.
And we're cleaning up this mess that starts out there.
We act like people die at the hospital.
Some do, of course, but for most of them, it was a...
There was a time, there was a last moment where they could have been saved.
[Inhales]
And that moment's long gone by the time they get here.
Um...
Dr. Elison?
Why don't you have a seat?
We should get things started.
So how does this work... exactly?
I mean, how do you go about... [Clears throat]
Evaluating someone's mental state?
Let's start with this.
Why do you think you're here?
Well, it's been a while since my psych rotation, but off the top of my head, I would say, um...
I had an inappropriate response to a clinical situation, possibly indicative of an affective disorder.
How was that?
Dr. Elison, I'm on your side.
My side?
Oh, good.
That's great.
It's good to know we're in this together.
All I'm saying is that I know you have been through a lot, and my job here is just to understand what happened.
Okay.
Let's try this again.
Here's the thing, um, Dr. Laster.
You're the one who decides whether my career as a physician ends today.
So I can tell you what happened, but the why?
That's your call.
- Doctor!
- [Shouts indistinctly]
You can say I'm fine.
That I'm here because I used an iv stand for a nonstandard purpose.
Get out of my way!
[Glass shatters]
You can say it was an isolated episode and I'm here because I had a hard night and I cracked under pressure.
Ahh!
[Shouting]
You can say I'm here because I'm batshit crazy.
[Overlapping shouting]
- Let's go!
- Get off of me!
- On the ground!
- Argh!
Stay there!
Guess you'll just have to take your pick.
[Dramatic music]
♪ ♪
Let's start with a little background.
Married?
Family?
Yes.
My wife, Samantha, is a real estate lawyer.
We have a son, Oliver, who's ten.
[Wind chimes tinkling]
We, uh...
We had an eight-year-old daughter, Becky, but we lost her last year.
I'm so sorry.
[Laughter, chimes tinkling]
And how long have you been in emergency medicine?
Uh, ten years.
Listen, uh...
Could we... could we skip this?
I-I know my behavior today was completely unacceptable and I will make whatever apologies are necessary, but...
I need you to understand, I have patients who need me.
So I'm asking you, uh, as a colleague, if...
Dr. Elison,
I appreciate your dedication to your work, but you're here as a patient, not as a colleague.
Tell me what happened on Sunday morning.
Of course.
[Sirens wailing in distance]
So while we're waiting on the labs, start her on the antibiotics and check her every 20 minutes.
Okay.
And if her fever doesn't go down?
Come and get me.
If it spikes, run and get me.
Got it?
That's why I wear my running shoes.
- All right.
- Yo, John.
- Can I borrow you?
- What's up?
I have a chest pain waiting, and sadly, we are bed-less.
Can... can five go to subacute?
Nope.
She crashed.
We tubed her.
She's waiting in ICU.
Okay, well, can nine go four and then four go hall?
Have you seen four?
Well, it says "minor laceration."
Yeah, and meth psychosis.
The guy tried to remove glass spiders under his skin with a screwdriver.
If we put him in the hall...
Then the spiders attack again?
- Right.
- Right.
Okay.
Three's due for a ct.
How about three goes up, nine takes her place, three comes back, he goes to subacute eight...
It's full.
I checked.
Yeah, but it's Henry Maxson.
I'll give him some Insulin, and move him into the hall.
That, I believe, gets you your free bed.
[Laughs] Bam.
My man.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. John Ellison is officially tonight's Samaritan hospital bed-Tetris champion.
- Let's hear it.
- Whoo!
(Woman) Way to go, Doctor.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Yes.
Yes.
Hey, you finish up and get some sleep, okay?
Yup.
[Inhales sharply] Okay.
Gretchen?
Am I interrupting?
I'm pretty sure you know the answer to that question, Doctor.
Yeah, well, finish up.
We got work to do.
Bed eight.
Isn't there a smoke alarm in here?
Maintenance disabled it.
I guess it kept going off.
- Go figure.
- Uh-huh.
Bed eight... that's Henry, right?
Yeah.
How is he?
Well, I guess they didn't cure diabetes in the last couple days, 'cause he still has it.
How's that feel?
- Any pain?
- No, not really.
I haven't had any pain for the last few days.
[Chuckles] Is it getting better?
Remember we talked about this last time you came in?
The lack of pain is the problem.
The nerves are damaged.
You been taking your Insulin?
I...
I've been trying, but I ran out of what Dr. Dan gave me last time.
I know it's hard, Mr. Maxson, but you got to keep up with your Insulin shots.
[Chuckles] Yeah, I know.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Henry, think it could be time to talk to a surgeon.
No.
N... no, hey, Doc...
That medicine you gave me last time, that worked.
We... we could do that again.
Henry, the gabapentin was for the pain.
It doesn't make anything better.
There's got to be something that... you can do.
I...
I promise, look, I will...
I will follow the diet and the exercise, and I'm gonna do the Insulin every day just like you told me.
I'm not gonna do it halfway this time.
I'm gonna do it all the way.
There's got to be something you can do.
Doc, please, don't take my foot.
We'll try antibiotic therapy a little while longer, but I really...
No, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Doc.
Excuse us a moment.
So vanco one gram iv, okay?
Thanks, Gretchen.
Hey, so I'm moving Henry Maxson into the hall for an Insulin drip and IV vanco.
Can someone check on him in 30?
Another Insulin drip and antibiotics?
Why, exactly?
We're gonna take another run at saving that foot.
Rip off the band-aid, for god's sake.
That foot was toast weeks ago.
Why are we wasting resources on a noncompliant basket case?
So what, you want to dump him in the alley out back?
It's a thought.
I'll keep an eye on him.
Go.
Thanks.
[Bird cawing]
[Child laughing]
Oh, oh, I think I found something, here, in your tummy.
I don't have anything in my tummy.
Trust me, I'm a doctor.
I think I found something, and I think it's...
It's an octopus.
No.
I don't have an octopus.
I think you do, but hold still.
Maybe I can get it.
- [Laughing] - [Dog barks]
John, if you rile up that dog, you're in trouble.
Okay.
Okay.
I was just checking Oliver for octopuses.
All right.
Come here.
Come here.
Give me a hug.
Oh.
- Daddy, you're squishing me.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
Hey, get this dog out of here.
Get out of here, Zeke.
[Sighs]
You okay?
Yep, I'm just, uh...
Long night.
I just...
I need some food and some sleep.
Any chance we can get you off nights this year?
I spoke to Jay about it.
He said he'd see what he could do but with all the time I had to take off last year...
[Sighs]
I fell off the day schedule.
Yeah.
Here.
Let me get that.
[Sighs]
- Oof.
- Ooh.
Tight.
Do you want me to relax you?
- Mm.
- It's been a while.
[Dog barking]
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[Barking continues]
Is that Zeke?
So what?
Let him bark.
Oh, f... wait.
Hold a minute.
[Barking continues]
Zeke.
Hey, Zeke.
[Growling]
Zeke!
Hey.
What the hell?
[Barking] Zeke, off.
Off.
Hey.
Leave it.
Leave it.
Is he alive?
He's not moving.
No, he's... he's asleep.
There's an animal rescue downtown I can take him to.
[Weakly] He'll make it, though, right?
[Clears throat]
[Normal voice] He'll... he'll be fine.
Hey, what's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
No, I just...
I was just remembering Becky chasing the squirrels in the back.
Me running after her, trying to keep her shoes tied...
[Sobs]
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Baby, just... just breathe.
It'll be okay.
I was doing so well.
And you're... you're still doing well.
God.
No, it's just, looking at that poor little thing there, dying.
He's not dying, Sam.
I'm gonna take him to the animal hospital.
- I'll take him right now.
- [Softly] Okay.
Hi.
Is there a vet on duty?
I got a squirrel here.
My dog got to it.
I'm bringing it in now.
I'm an M.D., and I gave him some midazolam.
(Woman) How's his breathing?
Uh...
It's, um...
Actually, I...
I won't be coming in.
[Phone beeps]
[Background chatter]
Ahh!
Ahh!
[Gunshots]
[Screaming] [Tires squeal]
[Indistinct shouting]
(Man) Help!
Somebody help!
Help!
Somebody help!
[Screaming]
Don't close your eyes, man.
- Don't close your eyes, man.
- Stop!
- Please!
- Stop it!
He's dying!
That dude shot him!
You're pumping an artery.
You're making it worse.
He's dying, man!
Help him!
Call 911.
Tell them we need an ambulance.
Do it right now.
- It hurts.
- I know it hurts.
I know it hurts, but you're gonna be...
You're gonna be okay.
[Tires squeal]
Damn!
They're coming back, man!
They're coming back, man!
[Engine revving]
[Tires squealing]
[Coughs]
[Gunshots]
[Tires squeal]
[Sirens wailing in distance]
[Sirens bloop]
[Indistinct chatter]
You're a lucky man, Dr. Elison.
The guys who were after you, not so much.
We found their car in that parking lot right over there.
Shooter ran off, but the driver's dead.
How did he... what caused it?
Well, we're still determining that, but it appears to be multiple gunshot wounds to the torso.
A... and the... the victim?
Is he...
He's on the way to the hospital.
Which one?
Samaritan?
Does it matter?
I work there.
Yeah.
You may get to spend some more time with him, then.
Now, one of the patrol officers found something in the passenger seat of your car...
The corpse of a small animal.
Can you tell me what that was doing there?
I... it was a squirrel.
My... my dog got to it.
- Squirrel?
- Yeah.
I was taking it to the vet on Edgewood and...
[Clears throat]
Well, it didn't make it.
I'm so sorry.
Well, look, we're gonna take you in.
Write a full report.
Wait.
Am I being arrested?
So long as everything lines up, you should be done in... a few hours.
All right.
Oh, by the way, there is just one other thing.
You said that the car was up by that lamppost there.
- Right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
About there.
Okay, just... just bear with me for a second here, if you would, because you see, you fired three rounds at a moving car and you hit the driver center mass.
That's...
I mean, that's incredible.
Got any explanation?
[Gunshots]
I just pulled the trigger.
Just pulled the trigger?
[Chuckles]
I told you you were a lucky man.
You should buy some lotto tickets.
Watch your head when you get in.
"Just pulled the trigger."
I should try that.
[Chuckles]
(Man) They're coming back, man!
They're coming back, man!
[Car accelerating]
[Gunshots]
[Tires squealing]
[Metal crunches]
Everything all right?
Never better.
You know, I read the police report earlier.
What you did was very brave.
[Scoffs]
I imagine it was also quite traumatic.
Traumatic enough to explain what happened today in the er?
[Chuckles] Let's not worry about that for the moment.
Just tell me if you remember your feelings at the time.
I...
I wasn't really thinking about my feelings.
No?
I'm surprised.
Between the incident with the squirrel, the loss of your daughter, your wife's reaction...
Obviously, I...
I had a lot on my mind, but, uh...
I was focused on the boy lying on the ground bleeding to death, and I remember thinking that he probably only had a partial arterial transection and I could save him if I could get pressure on it.
And the young man you shot?
[Scoffs]
What were your feelings about him?
[Sighs heavily]
Angry.
Angry he put me in the position where I had to do that.
How am I supposed to feel in that situation?
Guilty?
Uh, sad?
What?
- This isn't a test.
- But it is a test.
You're evaluating me.
What if I had no reaction?
I felt absolutely nothing after killing a 19-year-old kid?
Clearly unhealthy.
And at the other end of the spectrum, say I was completely overwhelmed and stopped functioning.
Unhealthy.
But between the two, there's the perfect mix of pain and dissociation.
It's just right.
So... where's that?
I'm afraid I can't answer that.
Why not?
I can give my patients an optimal O2 sat number or blood pressure range.
Dr. Elison, I don't know how else to put this.
I need to know how you process this trauma.
Do you know what happens after you shoot someone?
Like, what happens next, specifically?
Spend about six hours in a police station.
And it's not a therapeutic environment where you process your trauma.
[Sighs]
You all right there, Doc?
We're almost done here.
Yeah.
I, uh, I work late.
I haven't slept much.
How about a cup of our fine police station coffee?
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.
All right.
I don't blame you.
You know... [sighs]
These binders you've been looking at, these fellas right here are members of Norteños Locos...
Northern Atlanta-based, mostly Mexicans, central Americans.
These guys, they're part of an outfit called Vine City Crew.
They hang out in the area we picked you up at.
And these two binders are fighting each other these days.
So let me ask you a question.
Do you recognize any one of these guys?
- No.
- You're sure?
Well, there was a glare on the windshield and most of the people in the park were running away.
All right, well, it was worth a try.
And I guess that will finish us up.
Your wife's waiting for you in reception.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- Yeah.
Oh, Dr. Elison, just one more thing.
So far, this thing hasn't gotten any play with our friends in the press, which is good, because that just makes our job that much harder.
You plan on talking to reporters?
Oh, no.
No, I'm... why would I...
Well, you know, situations like this, reporters tend to get a little crazy and suddenly, everyone decides that there's a hero in our midst and, well, sometimes, someone decides he wants to be that hero.
That's not you, is it?
No.
No.
No.
That's not me.
Well, good.
You have a nice day.
John.
God.
It's all right.
I'm okay.
(Samantha) Is there anything else in the file, or...
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Thank you so much.
Yeah.
Okay.
Talk to you tomorrow.
[Phone beeps] [Sighs]
Who was that?
A friend in the D.A.'s office.
And?
Told me what he could.
The boy, the one you saved, he's the son of a prisoner in the federal system.
His name is Antoine Tyler.
I also found out about the boy who...
Was shot too.
His name was Raul Mendoza.
Police files have him listed as a known gang associate.
How are you doing?
I think I'm okay.
John, you don't have to be okay.
Sam, I know what happened today was... awful, but...
I can't explain it, exactly, but I feel different, like I can breathe.
And for the first time in a very long time,
I want to go to work.
(Samantha) John, you ready?
Ollie's gonna be late for school.
Be right there.
[Phone ringing]
- This is Dr. Harper.
- Hey, it's John.
Hey, Johnny, listen, I heard what happened.
Now, how are you doing?
[Sighs] Yeah, no, I'm fine.
Hey, I just wanted to check in on the boy who came in yesterday.
You... you worked on him, right?
(Quentin) Yeah.
Yeah, and he's good, as far as I know.
I mean, I didn't have him here too long.
Got him stable and I sent him up to surgery.
- He was all right, though?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I was worried for a little bit, but we got him through.
[Sighs] Great.
Okay.
That's... that's great.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
You're welcome.
- See you soon.
You okay back there?
You want some music?
No, thanks.
Why are you driving me to school?
Usually Mom drives me.
Well, I thought I'd drive you today.
Because of the thing that happened?
Ollie, what do you know about the thing that happened?
You got any questions you want to ask me?
No.
I understand.
What do you understand?
You told me when I got my shots.
When you're a doctor, to help someone, sometimes you have to do something that hurts.
[School bell rings]
All right.
Hey, I love you.
Yep.
I love you too.
[Buzzer]
(Man) Can I help you?
Uh, yeah.
I wanted to use the gun range.
You just select your weapon.
We have our rentals over here.
We got semiautomatics on top.
Revolvers lower.
Hmm.
Um...
That one.
It's a Beretta model 92.
Are you familiar with the weapon?
[Gunshots]
No.
Okay.
[Gunshots]
[Gun clicks]
[Gun clicks]
[Distant gunshots]
[Gunshot]
[Phone buzzing]
Hi.
(Samantha) Hey, it's me.
Where are you?
I... uh...
I'm out running errands.
[Sighs] John, your father called.
He's coming over.
All right.
Um...
I'll be... fine.
I'll be home in a few minutes.
Bye.
[Phone beeps]
Hey, Dad.
Thanks for coming over.
You don't have to pretend to be happy to see me.
- [Chuckles]
- I'm your father.
I get to worry about you whether you want me to or not.
Yeah.
Guess that's fair.
How you holding up?
Okay.
Going back to work?
Yep.
Tomorrow night.
Sam doesn't want me to, but I got a patient...
Uh, patients I need to follow up with, so...
Talk to a lawyer?
Police seem satisfied.
Yeah, well, that can all change.
People who weren't there second-guessing you.
Happened all the time in 'Nam.
Actually, uh...
I got a...
I got a question about that.
Were you... [sighs]
Good at it?
Was I good at what?
Was I good at Vietnam?
Oh, I don't know.
Were you good at...
War?
Yeah.
I guess I was.
When I got there, I did what I had to do.
That's pretty much the bar for being a good soldier.
And did you, uh...
Did it bother you?
After?
In my first firefight,
I got stuck behind this dead tree thing, and I'm just staying down, trying not to crap in my pants, and I hear this sound.
I think it's a lieutenant coming to tell us to fall back.
It's two NVA coming out of the jungle 30 feet away.
I shot them both before I could even think about it.
You never told me that.
I never much liked thinking about it.
When did you stop?
Thinking about it, I mean.
Next firefight.
Give it time.

(Farkas) Bullet behaved pretty well for a bullet.
Aside from the partial transection of the carotid, there was a pseudoaneurysm on the internal jugular.
How was the lung?
He was aspirating pretty badly by the time the ambulance got there.
(Farkas) Minimal damage to the trachea.
Mild trauma to the right apical segment.
I excised a chunk of the superior lobe.
Bullet came within a centimeter of the aorta, though, so I figured it was a small price to pay.
How much blood did he lose?
How many units did he need?
At least six during surgery.
If you're asking whether what you did at the scene saved the kid, John, yeah, it did.
I should run.
I'll add you to the patient update list, okay?
Yeah.

(Woman) I was in the backyard and...
She fell off the porch.
I pressure washed it this morning, and it was still slick this afternoon.
Let's...
let's let her answer please.
Okay.
So the, uh...
The bruises, that's where they came from too?
Y... yeah.
(John) And you're sure you only fell once?
'Cause, you know, you got bruises on both sides of your body.
It's kind of unusual to see that from a single fall.
Okay.
She told you what happened.
Yeah, and I'm just confirming what she said, sir.
Please.
So just one more thing to take care of.
We're gonna need a pelvic exam.
- Wait, what?
- Why?
Yeah, we just need to check.
In rare cases, a fall can cause reproductive harm.
So you can go to the waiting room.
(John) Yeah.

He's gonna kill you, eventually.

How is this your business, bitch?
If you expect us to put you back together after he busts you up,
I'd say it makes it our business!
Let's talk outside.
Excuse us, please.
Hey.
What was that?
Look at her charts.
She's been in here six times in a year...
Concussion, broken nose, ruptured spleen.
She is gonna die, and we're just watching it happen.
Believe me, I want to help her.
The guy's a son of a bitch, no question, but there are procedures for dealing...
Yeah?
Like what?
I got a procedure.
You still have that gun from the other day.
Excuse me?
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.
Are you proposing I...
I shoot the man?
- Why, are you offering?
- No, I am not offering.
Then I guess I was joking.
Just take her up to ct.
- So what was that about?
- Nothing.
Oh, come on.
Spill it.
Are we having another Gretchen incident?
Nothing.
You know they've been trying to fire her for over a year.
Don't feel you have to cover for her.
I said it's fine.
- Didn't look fine.
- Well, it was.
If you say so.
Hey, John, would you check me on something here?
What?
I got a kid in earlier, said he was in a fight.
Does this look like a coup and contrecoup to you?
(John) Could be.
It's hard to tell if that's blood or artifact.
What happened?
He get hit by a board maybe?
Or a bat?
He just said it was a fight.
He's not a talker.
I can't even get him to take his clothes off for a full examination.
He's a mean little sucker.
Won't take off his clothes?
Why?
I don't know, probably just a bad case of recent criminal activity syndrome.
I'll tell you one thing:
This didn't happen today.
I mean, judging from the tissue damage, the break is at least a day old.
- A day old?
- Yeah.
Maybe two.
Where is he?
That's him.
[Voice distorted] Came in with a couple guys who said they found...
Triage nurse said...
Either way, he's gonna need a surgical consult.
So we...
John!
John.
- Good evening, Mr. Rodriguez.
- 'Sup?
I hear you won't take off your clothes for the examination.
My colleague here just showed me your... your scans, and, uh, you're in bad shape.
Without a full exam, we're...
I got hurt on my face.
You can see that with my clothes on.
- John, seriously...
- Hold on.
I'll tell you what, how about this?
You tell us exactly how you hurt yourself, and then we'll see about the clothes.
Thought he was my doctor.
We both are.
So how did you hurt your face?
I don't got to talk to you, Doc.
(Dan) I'm not sure this is...
Mr. Rodriguez,
I'm concerned that the head injury may be causing confusion, and if that's the case,
I'm gonna have to compel treatment.
Yo, what are you talking about?
I'm saying do as I ask, or I'm gonna make you do as I ask.
Nah.
Not gonna happen.
Yes, it is.
Hey, just hang on.
- Get off!
Get off!
- Hey!
[Grunting]
Knife!
Ah!
[Grunting]
Get off me!
Help me get his arm free.
[Grunting]
- Get it.
- I can't get his arm free.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
[Grunts]
(Dan) You okay?
I'm all right.
Did nobody think to search this guy when he came in?
[Softly] I don't know.
Hey.
Was this for my patient?
Was this for Antoine Tyler?
You came into this hospital to kill my patient?
Is that what this is?
Answer me!
[Gun clicks] John!
Just cool off.
(Laster) Dr. Elison.
Dr. Elison.
Is it fair to say at this point that your medical judgment was clouded?
No.
No, I wouldn't say that it was.
You had a confrontation with a patient that wasn't yours.
On behalf of a patient who was.
We're talking about a medical judgment, Dr. Elison.
Let me ask you something.
When I shot Raul Mendoza, was that a medical decision?
I'd have to say no.
Kept my patient alive.
You killed someone.
All right, so what if I'd run away and left Antoine Tyler to die?
Would that have been a medical decision?
Result's the same.
One kid dies.
One kid lives.
The only difference is, it's my patient that dies.
Is that a better outcome?
Firing a gun is not a medical decision.
Okay.
So the gun's the issue.
So what if I stayed in the street and focused on tamponading the boy's carotid?
- Medical decision?
- Yes.
I'd say it is.
In which case I would have died along with my patient.
Two deaths instead of one in either of the previous scenarios.
Wouldn't call that a real victory for medicine, would you?
Touché, Dr. Elison.
Let's get back to Antoine Tyler, since he seems to be in the middle of all of this.
Dr. Laster, I think it's better for all concerned if we just leave him out of this.
Well, unfortunately, I can't do that.
There are patient confidentiality issues.
As there are with any kind of evaluation.
Now please, Doctor.
All right.
If you insist.
I'm saying I believe this patient was involved with Sunday's shooting of Antoine Tyler, yes.
(Dacy) And why do you think that, exactly?
He came in with bilateral orbital fractures, frontal skull fracture, and ethmoid sinus fracture.
All the injuries from a single, forceful blow.
And that means?
Usually, an MVA.
A face full of dashboard.
He was probably the passenger in the car, the one pulling the trigger.
You know, when we interviewed you, you said you couldn't see the passenger.
I couldn't.
Look, all I know is, he knew me, he was armed, and he seemed very intent on staying that way.
I guess I can get a forensics unit there in the morning.
We'll check him against what we found in the car.
Tomorrow morning?
Doc, we've had a very busy night.
If I have to ask you any more questions, I'll give you a call.
You be careful, okay?
Yeah.
How's that feel?
It's fine.
Thanks.
Hey, man, we need to talk.
Want to tell me what the hell that was back there?
I'm sorry.
I just...
I went in to talk to the guy, and things got out of hand.
Now, look, I understand you're under a lot of pressure, John, but, Jesus, that was my patient there.
You're talking about compelling treatment?
You had no grounds for that.
What if he complained?
I think if you bring a gun into a hospital, you lose your right to complain.
All right, just go home, and then we'll talk about this later.
I'm not going home.
I can't.
Uh, yeah, actually, you can.
That's what people do when they get stabbed at work.
I didn't get stabbed.
I got cut.
Okay.
My mistake.
Except here's the thing:
You know what people do when they get cut at work?
They go home.
I said I'm not going home, Dan!
Hey, listen, maybe it's not my place to tell you this, but I think you're taking this whole thing a little personally, John.
For a sec, I was actually worried you were gonna shoot that guy.
Dr. Elison, we got a situation in the waiting room.
Hey.
What's going on?
Those guys out there, they came in with Dr. Sherman's patient, the guy who cut your arm.
What are they doing?
They keep trying to come in.
They're not just in emergency, either.
Security stopped a couple of them in the east wing.
They found a guy in pediatrics.
Okay.
Did we talk to the police?
Yeah, I guess there's some kind of big thing going on across town.
- What?
What?
- Some kind of shooting.
They said they could get to us when they can get to us.
What about security?
I told Lewis and the others to lock the front area down, but they ain't the cops.
We can try to declare an internal emergency, send everybody we can along to Grady, but at this hour...
Do it.
Doctor, I'm supposed to call administration...
They got a problem, they can talk to me.
Just do it.
- Tell me if anything changes.
- Okay.
John, everything all right out there?
I think so.
For now anyway.
How's the arm?
Well, I'm not gonna bleed to death anytime soon.
[Chuckles] Good.
Listen, I wanted to talk to you about a patient.
- Okay.
Who?
- Henry.
Your pet diabetic with the dry-gangrenous left foot.
He's back in already?
Yep, he came in about an hour ago while you were in with knife guy.
He's in bad shape.
He tore open the foot.
Some kind of work accident, although, how he was even standing on it, I have no idea.
Yeah, he's got some kind of warehouse job.
Well, in any case, the cellulitis is now nec fasc.
He's septic and in DKA.
It has to come off now.
I, uh...
Need you to talk to him.
What is it?
He didn't take the news well.
Dr. Armstrong is in surgery for the next six hours, so I set up a transfer to the Ansley Surgical Center.
They're prepping the or now.
He says he doesn't want to go.
I said he had to.
Kind of left it there.
I'll see what I can do.
Hey, Henry.
Henry?
Hey.
Code blue.
Code blue!
I need a nurse in here!
Nurse!
(Woman over pa) Code blue, ER.
Code blue, ER, stat.
Get the code cart.
I need Dr. O'Neill in here now.
- Dr. O'Neill!
- Get him atropine.
When was the last time you were in here?
15 minutes.
Maybe 20.
Did you give him any medications?
Nothing.
He just wanted some water.
Sherry.
Sherry.
There.
Check those.
See what he took.
Digoxin, metoprolol, ativan, lisinopril, Norco.
Whoa, oh.
What happened?
Your patient OD'd on bed 15's meds is what happened.
He was fine!
I looked in on him.
You told a guy you were cutting off his foot, and you left him alone.
- Ventilator.
Let's go.
- Pacers, please.
Get a second large bore iv in his ac.
Tell pharmacy to get some Digibind and hang some dopamine.
Pacers, please.
Come on, come on, come on.
- Ready.
- Start pacing him.
[Machine whirs on]
We getting anything?
It looks like a block.
You give him the atropine?
- Yes. 1 amp.
- The pacer's not capturing.
Narcan, calcium, and glucagon...
Still nothing.
Nothing.

- Come on.

- It wasn't your fault.

Did he have any family?
No.
He used to talk about that when he was in here.
The paperwork, do you want me to...
I called the code.
I'll do it.
[Bridget sighs]
[Sighs]
[Clears throat]
Henry Maxson, 28-year-old diabetic male.
I discovered the patient unresponsive and cyanotic.
I initiated CPR and dosed...
[Softly] Dosed atropine, one milligram iv.
- Doctor.
- Yeah.
- Uh, is something...
- [Clears throat]
Yeah, just, uh, give me a minute, please.
Um, uh, the thing is, there's a phone call for you.
Who is it?
He won't say, but it sounds important.
But I think you should take it.
Hello?
(Man) Is this Dr. Elison?
Yes.
W... who am I speaking with?
I...
I said, who am I... (Man) The boy you saved...
I'm his daddy.
(John) Um... what can I do for you?
Tonight, a Mexican dude came up into the hospital.
- He cut you.
- Yes.
- H... how did you...
- You know why he was there?
I think he was there to kill your... your son.
That's right.
The others, the ones outside, they're gonna be coming in to do what he didn't do.
He's safe here.
There's security.
(Man) No.
You listen to me, Doctor.
That ain't gonna stop these men.
They got a job to do, and they mean to do it.
They're gonna be up in that hospital tonight.
W... what... what do you...
What do you want from me?
What you think I want?
I want you to save him.
Antoine dies tonight, we gonna have a problem.
I'll try.
You do that, Doctor.
You do that.
I got to go.
Wait.
I...
[Sighs]
[Sighs]
Nurse.
Nurse.
Gretchen!
Remember the patient from earlier, the one with the...
The fractured clavicle?
Yeah, you mean the one who slipped?
- Yeah, I remember that one.
- Is she still here?
Yeah, she's up in Radiology.
I got the...
Gretchen.
I got the sense that she meant something to you.
What if we could help her?
If her blood work came back positive for signs of meningitis, we could get her into isolation, away from the boyfriend, get a social worker in there, maybe save her life.
Why would her blood work come back positive for meningitis?
Because her doctor said it did.
Interesting.
Why would her doctor do this?
I need your help.
I need to get Antoine Tyler out of this hospital now.
It needs to happen without anybody knowing.
Okay, well, he's a sick kid.
Where do you propose to put him?
Henry Maxson was scheduled to go to Ansley Surgical Center, but the hospital doesn't know that.
I ran the code, called it, but it's not in the computers yet.
If we switch Antoine's records with Henry's, you can get him down to transport.
They can get him over to Ansley under Henry's name.
And when he lands at Ansley?
Well, they'll discover that he's not a 28-year-old diabetic.
He'll become a John Doe with a gunshot wound, and... and he's not in the system.
Until Ansley cross-references the records and puts it together five minutes later.
And besides, I can't just wheel him out in front of security.
Gretchen, the boy is going to die tonight if I don't do something.
There has to be a way.
I didn't say there wasn't a way.
I said your way won't work.
Hey, it's Dr. Elison.
I got some lab results back on patient farmer.
She came in with a fractured clavicle, but we found some nuchal rigidity, and along with her headaches, it looks like meningitis.
(Man) Seriously?
Viral?
Probably bacterial.
So let's do an LP and call Infectious Diseases about, you know, getting her admitted ASAP.
The lab results are in the computer.
(Man) All right.
I'll get on it right away.
Thanks.

- Let me through!
- I can't let you do that.
- Come on, man!
- I can't let you do it!

Okay?
You don't want to go out there.
Get out of my way!
Get out, all of you.

You want to hurt somebody?
Hurt me.

You should be out there dealing with them.
Stop it now, or we have to cuff you.
You understand?
All right.
All right.
I'm done.
- I'm done.
- Let's go.
So Antoine Tyler...
Did not disappear into thin air.
No.
And your breakdown...
Was either less severe than you thought or a lot more severe.
Let me know if you figure that out.
You realize I have to report this.
Do you know what that will mean?
Do you?
I know that that is not what you wanted to hear, but your mental state is out of...
This is not about me.
This is about you understanding what your decision today means for patient Tyler, currently recovering at Ansley Surgical Center.
That is not relevant to this evaluation...
It is all that is relevant.
He is a patient in my care.
This is criminal behavior, Dr. Elison, and under the circumstances,
I cannot recommend that you return to work, much less see patients.
I'm sorry if that is not an acceptable outcome for you, but...
Let me finish!
You took an oath to do no harm, just like I did, Doctor.
So let's...
let's talk about harm.
If you report everything you've heard today, this is what's going to happen:
I will lose my job, and I will be unable to protect Antoine Tyler, and the men looking for him will find him, and they will kill him.
Is that an acceptable outcome?
No.
I think that's all we have to talk about then.
Dr. Elison?
I just want to say one thing before you go.
In my practice, I counsel a lot of doctors on the risks they have to take to help people.
I have to tell them to accept that some measure of playing god is necessary to do the job.
But there's a reason we confine that to the practice of medicine.
It protects them, and it protects you.
You take that outside the hospital, and there will be complications.
[Door closes] Good luck.

MAN:
That's better.
See, it doesn't take long.
I've spent a lot of time in enclosed spaces.
That's taught me the importance of order, you know?
Everything in its place helps to focus your thoughts.
Without order, it's almost impossible to achieve your goals.
Should remember that.
What's the point in having polish if you're never gonna use it?
Hey?
And where's the rest of your gear?
There ain't none.
That was the last!
(SHAKES CAN)
No, I swear to God.
Honest!
Look, there's supposed to be...
Supposed to be what?
Hey?
What?
!
More coming in.
A lot more!
A shipment!
This month!
Who told you that?
Eh?
Mal!
He heard it from Xav.
That's his uncle.
- He does the takings.
- Where?
All right.
Dry-cleaner's!
Lingdale Street.
(GAS HISSES)
(MICROWAVE BEEPS)
You're benching me?
Oh, you're not listening!
You're just not working Docker, that's all.
- I got you his name.
- CARTWRIGHT:
He saw you!
Then he made a concerted effort to have you killed!
Both of which, I might add, you neglected to mention to us, or any of your other colleagues.
Come on, Ash.
You'd be a liability.
And you know it.
Did you learn anything else from this...
Yorkie?
No.
We're working Docker carefully.
With the extent of our infiltration on the phones, there'll be plenty other avenues to explore.
But... you're right.
You got us Becker's name.
And a deal's a deal.
Martin, we...
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Sorry, I...
Hello.
No.
No, no.
No, yeah.
Yeah.
Er, yeah, yeah, it was a good night.
Um, sorry, hang on.
Let me just, er...
What did you expect was in there?
The lost Harry Potter?
Everybody needs a hobby.
I love that one.
(DOOR SLAMS)
You took your time.
Did he give you trouble?
Not really.
So what did you get?
See, I told you going after the pushers was the way forward.
It's easy money, innit?
Hitting guys who ain't gonna report it to the police.
Huh?
Lovely.
Low risk.
And low reward.
Ambition, Donny, is the keystone to success.
What, you get that out of this?
Look, I know you needed that motivation bollocks to get you through it on the inside, but... you don't want to wind up back there, do you?
Nice and steady.
What we talked about.
(STARTS ENGINE)
Partners, yeah?
Partners.
KIM:
Gavin Docker, Esq.
TOMMY:
Number of convictions?
One guess.
ASH:
Zero.
No home phone, no mobile contracts.
In all the months we've been up on this crew, not one recorded call with him on it.
TOMMY:
The electrician's firm he works for is pukka.
All of them on that row are.
KIM:
The motor is in his wife's name, which does flirt with dodginess.
These guys do that all the time.
They put anything and everything in the wife's name.
They don't leave a trail.
So it can't be taken if they get nicked.
What about groundwork?
I dunno.
KIM:
He comes and goes out of the yard in the front.
MARTIN:
We watch the back.
He never parks round there.
KIM:
And when he goes out, he's a spark, changing plugs and doing fuse boxes.
And the rest of the time, he's in the shop.
MARTIN:
Whole days and the van just stays right there.
We're watching him the whole time.
If I didn't know he was dodgy, I'd have trouble believing it.
(PHONE RINGS)
Hello.
Ah, hi.
Sorry, just give me a second.
I'm Bernie's relief.
There's someone higher than him.
TOMMY:
If you're right about that... and there's someone else at the top, Docker's got to be the way in.
And I'm supposed to sit it out!
I didn't come this far to watch someone else take the star prize.
Come on, Ash.
We're a team.
There's other angles.
Maybe.
Yeah, and, er it's going to be me and you again.
Huh?
Yeah, they're...they're giving me field duty.
Yeah?
You're ready?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Lorna's going to be happy, knowing I've got your back.
What?
ROACH:
To Mexico.
To business.
- Good trip, then?
- We're in play.
He's sending someone, some lawyer of his, over to sign and seal, and it's done.
I'm going to pull it off, Gav, bring it in.
You had your doubts, didn't you?
Proved you wrong, didn't I?
Didn't I?
VALERIE:
All right, love.
If you want a chocolate biscuit, you know, you only have to ask.
Um, I...
I need to talk to you about something.
Oh, yeah?
I got a call.
Hey...
Look, um, I was wondering if you could do a little bit of magic on this for me?
It got damaged...
You reckon you could figure out what the last number that called it was?
Well...
Yeah, it's probably nothing.
I don't want to bother people with it.
Just between me and you.
Thanks.
Got no home to go to?
TOMMY: just can't believe it.
Ash and Lorn.
SONIA:
It's tough, for sure.
But I've heard what he's like with his work.
I know he's your friend, but...
Yeah, my friend.
He needs his friends more than ever.
I can help him, though.
How's the best way to do that?
Get back out there with him.
Are you sure you're ready?
Yeah.
Of course, look.
Look, watch.
(SONIA LAUGHS)
- See?
- Yeah...
- Look at that.
- Your legs, but...
Look...
Sonia, I want...
I want to be back to...before.
I didn't know you before.
And...
I like you just fine.
- Come on.
- Right there?
Yeah?
- (CAMERA CLICKS)
- Oh, you're tak...
- (SONIA LAUGHS)
- I told you about that!
So what have you done about it?
- What can I do?
- You can talk to her.
She knew what this work was going to be like.
Oh...
You didn't tell her, did you?
I tried.
- I tried.
- Did you?
Or did you assume?
Come on.
You can kip at mine tonight.
VALERIE:
Right, what's going on at Docker's?
Absolutely nothing.
Nada.
OK.
Keep me informed.
BERNIE:
You might as well pop in and top up your tan.
- (PHONE RINGS)
- TOMMY:
That's funny.
Someone's calling out from the dry-cleaner's.
Never usually calls out.
XAVIER:
What?
- MAL:
It's me.
- It's Mal calling Xav.
- XAVIER:
Where are you?
- MAL:
At the shop.
MAL:
I've got a situation.
I've got something here.
- What you mean?
- I need you to come.
- What you on about?
- Not on the phone.
- I'm miles away!
- You need to come.
I'm not coming unless you tell me... (LINE GOES DEAD)
Right.
Get yourself down that dry-cleaner's now.
What is it?
Mal calling Xavier.
Didn't sound right.
Xavier?
He's old news.
And take Tommy with you.
Go on.
Break him back in.
Let's check it out.
ASH:
Must have been half an hour.
TOMMY:
Should have been open by now.
Come on, mate.
You're the one who made us stake out Maltese Frankie at that clinic for three days.
He said he was getting his hair done.
I didn't think he meant a transplant.
(THEY LAUGH)
Ahh...
You don't mind if I bump things along, do you?
- Why?
What are you gonna do?
- It's a front, innit?
They want us looking at the front.
I'm going to go round the back.
No faulting that logic.
(PHONE CHIMES)
Ash!
Xav's here!
Ash, he's coming your way!
Ash, Xav's coming round the back.
Why aren't you open?
!
(MAL BREATHES HEAVILY)
(PRESS STEAMS AND HISSES)
Well...
I've made a start, but really... it's absolutely no sense of order.
- (IRON HISSES) - (MUFFLED CRIES)
Keys.
Chuck 'em.
(KEYS JANGLE)
Jesus, mate.
He's my sister's boy.
There's no need for this.
Let's hope not.
What do you want?
I read this book...
Said that you needed to target people that can catalyse
- your advancement.
- I don't know what you're on about.
Little bird told me you had a big load coming in.
He actually used the word "shipment...
XAVIER:
I don't know anything about any shipment!
(MUFFLED CRIES)
Shipment!
This month!
All right!
Look, I don't know exactly when.
This month, probably.
He don't tell us that!
So now you're going to tell me his name.
I don't mean the guy that's next up.
What's his name?
It was Docker, weren't it?
- (MUFFLED CRIES)
- It was Docker.
So not him.
I want the guy at the top... and I want to know where to find him.
- (WHIMPERING)
- I can't tell you that.
(WHIMPERS)
Then I'm going to have to steam the skin off your sister's lad's face.
- (WHIMPERS)
- Unbearable pain, apparently.
I read that in a book, too.
Different kind of book.
(IRON HISSES)
All right!
Stop!
Wait!
($055)
Ssh!
I didn't tell you his name.
Tommy, I think there's a guy coming round the front.
Stay on him.
He's heading into a supermarket on Brennan Street.
Keep eyes on him!
(TYRES SCREECH)
WOMAN:
What the f...!
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
- ASH:
Tommy?
- Yeah, I'm on him.
I'm close!
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
(GROANS)
(GROANS)
(GASPS)
- Where is he?
- I...
I lost him, mate.
Excuse me.
Where can I find the manager, please?
Have you got CCTV?
Yes, Dad, I know.
I know you've got your appointment today.
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm going to be home in about half an hour.
Do you want to drop the girls off on your way to the clinic?
Yeah?
OK.
Bye.
Bye.
No motor?
Failed its MOT.
Come on, then.
Get in.
- Oh, no, I'm nearly...
- Come on.
Thanks.
We take it off the small fry, yeah?
That's the plan.
That's your plan.
There's 50 of your pissing little jobs in there.
You've got to think bigger.
People who have this kind of money, right, they're going to come looking for it!
So let them look.
How are they going to find it, eh?
It's just me...
Well, rne and you.
This is our time.
See, destiny is a ride you have to choose to get on.
Whatever.
Come on.
Let's go nuts.
Hey...
Don't spend too much of it.
Why not?
Might need it for something.
- Thanks for that.
- You're welcome.
Where are the girls?
Are they out with their dad?
No, he's, urn...
They're with my dad, actually.
He's dropping them off any minute.
What about Danny?
He's at football club.
Love him to bits, but, you know... just need to find somewhere to get his energy out.
You know?
Kids, eh?
Life?
You cope all right, though, don't you?
I have my mechanisms.
Right.
Oh.
- You want a go?
- No...
No.
Have you never tried it?
Well, not si...
- My husband, I mean...
- Is he here?
I'd better go.
Here...
Take it.
In case you need it.
Thanks...
I think.
- Bye.
- See ya.
ROACH:
They turned the dry-cleaner's over.
Xav said there was three of them.
Some other crew?
Sometimes people just get robbed.
Maybe that's all it was.
How much did they get?
What was in the safe.
Six large...
Bit more.
If word gets out that another organisation is moving in on us...
Nobody takes what's mine.
No weakness.
Not now, not with what we've got coming in.
You find out who it was.
And when you do, I want them to know exactly who they've tangled with.
TOMMY:
You're sure that was the word he used?
- "Shipment"?
- "This month."
Oh.
I heard something else.
Couple of the crew calling about some "special package".
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Said it was coming soon.
ASH:
If we can only find out who he was...
Yeah...
Mate, look, urn...
- Back there.
I'm sorry...
- Don't think about it.
- No, it was really busy.
I...
- One of them things.
Look, you're just a little ring rusty, that's all.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Take forever, don't they?
Mr Roach...
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm a big admirer of your business.
Show me your hands.
You're not a scaffolder.
Not that business.
I'm looking for an opportunity in an organisation with ambition... scale.
I've had one look at you.
Anyone asked me, I could not remember what you look like.
You're not in my world.
But if I turn around and I see you still there then I will know you.
Is that what you want?
If I've heard about it others will, too.
I'm talking about your shipment.
Still here...
All I know is... a man has something other people want those people are going to come after it.
My name is Casby.
You can text me on that number.
I'm at your disposal.
Just to say, I admire your vision, purpose.
You need the personnel to match.
WOMAN:
Ta-da!
What do you think?
For Friday!
It's, er...
It's not too...revealing, is it?
Get it.
Ash...that phone you gave me.
It was the last number you wanted, right?
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah.
That was a payphone.
Thanks.
(PHONE RINGS)
MAN:
All right?
Heard you had some bother.
- (MUSIC ON RADIO)
- Yeah, well.
There were four of 'em.
What, you mean that crew that barbecued Fergus's caravan?
Could have been.
Monica!
Will you turn that bloody radio down?
!
Still it's not all bad news.
Word is...it's going to be tomorrow, and that other thing...
Yeah, this special package is going to do the business for the lads.
Gav said he was going down there personal to see it.
Police!
Stay where you are!
- Police!
- Stall 'em!
Oi!
Oi!
(YELLING)
- My guy's just been hit by the police.
- I'm getting the same thing.
It's happening everywhere.
- Stop there!
Stop there right now!
- Police.
Stay where you are!
- Come here!
Oi!
- Right, down on the ground.
Get down now!
(YELLS)
Police!
Open the door!
Get off the phones!
Now!
(BANGING AT DOOR)
Armed police!
Get your hands where we can see 'em!
(LINE GOES DEAD)
What the hell is happening?
The Old Bill has just moved in on all our targets.
They've all stopped talking.
What?
What do you think?
That bastard!
Open that safe.
It's open.
(SAFE CLICKS)
Turn the place upside down!
CARTWRIGHT:
I want to know how our intel got out of this office!
(PHONE BUZZES)
It's Gemmill.
Everyone?
They hit all the boys at the same time?
But not you?
What's that supposed to mean?
- What did they find?
- Nothing.
Most of the boys are out of product.
They'll be back to it in no time.
You're missing the point!
Another crew is coming after our action.
Elliot...
And they've got the pigs in their pocket!
This is not happening!
Not happening now while I've got his lawyer sitting out there waiting for me.
Someone wants to send me a message, yeah, mess me up when I'm so close?
Well, they'd better be prepared to go the whole way!
So what are you gonna say to this Mexican's lawyer?
Guess what?
I'm not going to start by saying that my whole distribution chain just got arrested!
When this deal is done and this stuff comes in, it needs moving, quick... and quiet.
I'm on it.
(PEOPLE YELLING AND SHOUTING)
Look, Stannard's still in there, so I have to be careful.
- You know how he got the information?
- No.
He's been after something like this for months, but then, a few days ago, it all just landed in his lap.
We've lost all our phones.
You know, these guys, they're going to change up everything now.
It's going to take us months to get back to where we were.
You know, all that work...
I'm sorry.
Really...
If you need anything, you just ask.
Yeah, listen, urn...
I'm trying to find out if this guy's got a past.
I would love to put a name to that face.
Listen, I've got to go check something out.
MAN (AMERICAN ACCENT):
My client sends his regards.
He very much enjoyed meeting you.
He's a very good host.
Yes, he is.
Between you and me, too good.
He sometimes forgets the line between business and relaxation.
Which is why I get sent in after the fact, just to make sure that, er...
Make sure of what?
Well, that you're serious about this.
I paid a hundred grand just to get in a room with him.
Serious enough for you?
The initial deposit has been accepted.
This, as you know, is non-refundable.
The moment the shipment leaves Panama City, it is considered to be in your possession, and its value becomes your responsibility.
My client will not tolerate repayments that are late or that are different than those agreed upon.
Inside here is the address of a website that will allow you to track the progress of your purchase.
This is the point of no return, Mr Roach.
Why don't you afford yourself a moment, just to...
Keep up with the repayments, huh?
Always put the milk in first.
Otherwise...you look like a tourist.
ASH:
You all right, mate?
Look, I was playing here as a guest last Tuesday and I got chatting to a member, john something or other.
Anyway, he's thinking about selling his golf clubs, gives rne his number...
I'm frickin' hopeless, me.
So I just went and lost it.
You don't have a list of who was playing here that day, do you?
Er, you've got the wrong day, mate.
You couldn't have been here Tuesday.
That was, er, Medal Day, and then a club dinner.
You know, it's members only that day.
Right.
Must have been Wednesday, then.
I dunno...
Look, he's a member.
John...
You don't have a membership list?
You're kidding.
Club secretary guards that list with his life.
The "great book" never leaves his sight, except when it's locked in a safe in his office.
I see...
Like anybody cares!
CONNOR:
We had an agreement.
I gave you the intelligence - all the criminals' names the UNIT were up on, and you'd get my disciplinary sorted.
I'm not in the business of brushing serious police misconduct
- under the carpet.
- No, no, no.
I stole...
I stole that intel for you.
Wouldn't go around announcing that.
Theft's a crime last time I checked.
DOCKER:
Well, they've let Xav go.
Tell him he needs to ditch the dry-cleaner's, set up another front.
Pronto.
We need to be making money out of this gear straight away.
Hit those repayments.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
I think we could do with some extra personnel.
Come in.
(DOOR OPENS)
- (MUSIC PLAYS) - (FAINT CHATTER)
Someone's going for it.
Going to join me?
No, I've got to meet someone.
I've got to be somewhere.
Probably something I best do alone.
Anything I can help with?
Heard you had your own problems.
So, how do you know about it?
The thing you told me about?
Loose talk.
You might want to think about tightening up your security.
Ah, now...
Any troubles lately?
You don't mind if I, er, straighten these up a bit?
Show them off a bit better?
Elliot...
And what is it you want?
To be...useful.
What, and I'm supposed to just trust you?
No.
That's something I'll have to earn.
And how are you going to do that?
I'm working on it.
- So you knew?
- Tommy told me.
- I mean, he wasn't...
- Nah, it's not a big deal.
It'sjust a...
It's just a thing.
Well, sorry to hear it.
What you said, about, um, this kind of work and family life not being a good fit...
No, you were right.
You were right.
And me going toe to toe with Cartwright, losing Lorna, and watching all our lines get pissed away by whoever gave Stannard...
Despite all of that, it matters, what we're doing, don't it?
It's worth it, isn't it?
It's got to be.
It's good.
It's good talking about it with someone like you.
What am I like?
Got your shit together, ain't ya?
I...
It's hard talking about it with people who don't who aren't...
Who aren't what?
Aren't like you and me.
- What's going on, Kim?
- Oh...
Oh, Jesus, I'm so sorry.
Kim?
Time to move on, eh?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Don't want to take out someone on the same team.
That's right.
I'm Casby.
Hm?
Thought it better we didn't meet in polite company.
Might have been a bit awkward.
You turned me over.
You threatened Mal with a steam iron!
That was then.
I was just making my move.
To show you there's no hard feelings, I thought I'd give you the heads up.
Right?
- This business with the Old Bill...
- What about it?
The boss well, he's understandably on edge about it, you know, with everything that's going on.
But your mate Docker, he's very good at covering his own arse.
See, he's not saying that you grassed everyone up.
He's just not saying you didn't.
He what?
I got arrested, for Christ's sake!
That would be the clever part.
Deflect suspicion.
It had nothing to do with me!
He's the one!
He's the one who got seen by the law!
Well... we've all got our little secrets now, haven't we?
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Mr Roach would be impressed by anybody who gives out his name on a bit of paper.
What do you reckon?
You and me we can do each other a big favour.
HOW?
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- Come on, Smoke.
Even superpowers like yours need a little bit of sharpening once in a while.
That safe did have an interesting mechanism.
- So what?
Someone big in there?
- (CAMERA CLICKS)
The biggest.
Maybe.
- Then you're wasting your time.
- (CAMERA CLICKS)
Guy like that'd be untouchable.
He'll have three, maybe four layers of protection from the law.
And his first line of defence is his consigliere.
Oh...
- You've seen The Godfather, right?
- Yeah.
His right-hand man who protects him, and who he trusts.
- You make it sound all warm and cuddly.
- (CAMERA CLICKING)
Cuddly like a snakepit.
The closer you are to the top, the more people there are trying to sink their fangs into you.
You said this was the last favour.
So...we're square.
Yeah.
Once you've put it back.
(MUFFLED WHIMPERS)
(RUSTLING)
Your money.
Who is he?
Connected with another crew.
He's the one who torched Fergus's caravan.
Is that him?
The one who turned you over?
- Yeah, that's him.
- (MUFFLED CRIES)
I thought you said there were three of them.
You've overreached yourself, my son.
ROACH:
Got one?
Let's see it, then.
(MUFFLED CRIES)
(CLATTERING)
(GUN COCKED)
That's what I need.
Someone who'll step up.
You're with me now.
Put it in the river.
Not too far out.
It needs to be seen.
CASBY:
There's something you should know.
Bloke in the boot...
- He said...
- What?
He knew about the shipment.
It's common knowledge with his crew.
Says someone told them about it.
Someone on the inside.
Now...
I don't know how many people you've told...
VALERIE:
Golf club members list?
ASH:
Could you work through 'em for me?
And you're giving me this on the sly because...?
Things have been getting out of this office, if you hadn't noticed.
OK.
Leave it with me.
(SHE CLEARS THROAT)
(PHONE BUZZES)
Yeah?
That CCTV picture...
Got an ID for you.
Name of Justin Casby.
Have you got an address?
Ha!
Even better than that.
I can tell you exactly where he'll be in 45 minutes.
When?
This morning.
I said he could have the time.
So we have one setback and he wants to go?
Bit more to it than that.
There's something I have to tell you.
Taking that laptop home was a direct breach of our policy!
You've not only undone months of work, you've put the very future of this UNIT in jeopardy!
- If you want me to resign...
- Oh, don't be daft.
That's all I need.
Another bloody quitter!
Did we really misjudge you that badly?
No!
I want to stay.
And I want to make it right.
So you can start now.
The last thing we learnt before the phones went down was our crew are expecting a "special package"... today.
And we know Docker's going to be there for it.
So get on him, and get close to whatever that is.
Do not let us down again.
He clamped his van.
He ain't going nowhere else today, then.
It doesn't make sense.
- You definitely heard it?
- Yeah.
Two times. "Special package."
Xav said it would be this afternoon.
He said Docker was going to be there unless...
What?
Something Ash said the other day.
If it's a front, what's going on round the back?
That van...
Hmm.
What does a tanning salon need a van for?
Shit!
Drive!
Drive!
VALERIE:
Right, so what are you saying?
KIM:
This is how he swerved our surveillance.
He's been sneaking out the back and using another vehicle.
Better be right.
KIM:
Wrong wheels for a tanning salon.
Right wheels for a drug dealer.
(ENGINE STARTS)
Val, we have a visual.
VALERIE:
She did it.
She pulled it off.
The least she owes us!
And I take it we're still paying Ashton's wages?
Does anybody know where the hell he is?
(IN DISTINCT TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT)
Ash?
What the hell are you doing here?
You're 50 yards from Docker.
Kim, get him out of there!
Cartwright's going to kill you!
- Where did he go?
Docker?
- Hospitality box.
Third on the left.
When did he get here?
Few minutes ago.
He was in a rush.
Next race...
Ash...
Kim, get Ash away from Docker...now!
Tommy?
Can you hear me?
Tommy?
Oh, sorry.
(BREATH ES HEAVILY)
(HORSE WHINNIES LOUDLY)
Oh!
ASH:
Val?
It's me.
I'm at the racecourse.
Yeah, yeah, I know where you are!
And if Docker sees you, we could lose our lead to whatever this "package" is they're on about.
ASH:
Listen to me.
You need to get up the runners for the next race on the internet.
Right.
Look at the names of the owners.
Right, give us a chance.
Is Docker's name there?
You're in a hurry, ain't you?
Just happy to be here.
You ever heard of the Peter Principle?
No?
The Peter Principle says that in most organisations people will be promoted beyond their ability.
Sound familiar?
You've wormed your way in this far, but you want to know how many like you I've seen come and go?
And here I still am.
You know what I think?
I think it's better to be the boss with a gram of gear... than a lackey sitting on a warehouse full.
I'm the one that looks out for Elliot.
We'll see who's standing at the end.
COMMENTATOR:
The horses have just come in to the track now and are starting to go behind...
WOMAN:
Starting!
Come on.
VALERIE:
No.
No Docker.
His name isn't on it.
OK...
The golf club members list I gave you...
Well, hang on, I've not had a chance to look at it yet.
Do any of the names match?
Hey.
Tommy, Ash is here.
(BREATH ES HEAVILY)
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
I'm, er...
You're dripping!
It's all right, it's all right... just...don't tell Ash...yeah?
COMMENTATOR:
And they're racing, and a good, clean break with five furlongs to cover.
Val...
Val, talk to me.
Come on, Val!
Nothing.
None of the guys on this list.
Val!
Women owners...
Do any of the surnames match?
COMMENTATOR:
Now they're moving in to the final two furlongs and the jockeys are getting to work.
They're getting a lot more serious.
Ash!
Yeah?
- (CROWD ROARS)
- Roach!
(CROWD SHOUTS)
- Which horse?
- Number six.
(SOUNDTRACK DISTORTS AND ECHOES)
Kid's got something about him, no?
You need people you can trust.
That's right, Gav.
I do.
Shipment's on the move.
Two stops before it gets to us.
TANNOY:
Here's confirmation of the result.
First, number six.
Second, number five...
ROACH:
It's a good omen, that.
Since when have you been superstitious?
VALERIE:
Ash?
Ash!
Yeah?
(SIGHS) The name of that horse, yeah?
It's called Special Package.
They've been talking about a bloody horse.
Don't matter.
Don't matter.
I'm not procrastinating.
I've been trying to give it proper thought.
Yes, I understand the time factor.
TOMMY:
Forget about it, Kim...
- I'll be fine...
- Tommy...
You need an answer right now?
CARTWRIGHT:
How many times does he have to wilfully disobey us before you'll stop
- defending him?
!
- I was only trying to...
I don't care what you're trying to do.
He is through!
YOU!
Hey, you!
I'm talking to you!
ASH:
Everything this crew's been doing - money laundering, pills, armed robbery... it's been leading up to this!
This!
This is big!
Now we've got every street dealer in the six zones ready to sell his stuff.
All the lives that touches...
All that misery.
If he makes that importation, and he puts it out on them streets, then he wins...and we lose.
# Ain't shady, baby
# I'm hot like the prodigal son
# Pick a petal, eeny meeny miny mo
# And flower, you're the chosen one
# Well, your left hand's free
# And your right's in grip
# With another left hand
# Watch his right hand slip
# Towards his gun
# Oh, no
# Well, my left hand's free
# Oh, no!
#
YES, YES!

AND THE PARKIE GOES TO...
BENSON!
FROM PARK.
COME TO THE STAGE AND CLAIM YOUR PRIZE!
All: [ Chanting ] SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH!
HERE YOU GO, BENSON.
YOU DESERVE IT.
THIS IS REALLY THE BEST AWARD I COULD WIN.
I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU GUYS.
NOT JUST FOR BEING THE BEST STAFF I'VE WORKED WITH,
BUT ALSO BEING THE BEST FRIENDS I COULD ASK FOR.
BECAUSE OF YOU, EVERY DAY I COME INTO WORK,
I FEEL LIKE A TRUE WINNER.
THANK YOU.
Ah!
I know what the problem is.
None of the players are black.
Whatever, Reg.
Come on, man.
That's my Lionel Messi move right there.
Watch again.
Graceful.
I might be playing the wrong sport, y'all.
- Happy days.
Happy days, fellas.
- Vince!
Angela's got her money and we have all the pictures back on file, everything.
We can finally move on to bigger and better things.
- For real, man.
Thanks, Spencer.
- Come on.
So everything is cool?
Everything is now everything.
Okay, everything's everything.
So, what, you gonna swipe my catchphrase now?
Is that it?
Man, chill, Reggie.
I'm just saying we don't have to be slobbering all over the man.
You come here trotting on your high horse like you saved the day.
Let's not forget all this shit was Spencer's fault in the first place.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I just came to deliver good news.
That's what we wanted to do.
Well, next time a fucking phone call will do.
Wow.
Well, you're lucky I didn't call Vernon and tell him about your little joy ride you took with Angie the other night.
- Joy ride?
- He's tripping.
I wish I was tripping.
She gave me the entire rundown last night.
Every gag-inducing detail.
Man, what the fuck you do now, Reggie?
Nothing.
I took her home just like you asked me to.
And we were bonding over what an asshole Spencer is.
But I wasn't the fucking asshole who disrespected her and made her take the bus home.
- You did what?
- She jumped out the car.
Because you pulled your pecker out at the stoplight.
Listen, man, we was getting along.
I thought she wanted to fuck.
So that's your move?
Pull out your dick?
What's the big deal?
What's the big deal?
You offered to pay her.
Everyone got the right to get paid.
What the fuck is wrong with you, Reggie?
Reg, hey, you treated her like a piece of meat.
- Angie didn't deserve that.
- I thought she was a ho.
That shit ain't right, Reg.
Ange, she cool.
She ain't even a ho like that.
That's discriminatory.
My cousin Felicia, cooler than a mother.
But she an enormous ho.
I mean, suck your dick through your jeans.
What?
Felicia ain't cool at all.
I didn't say nothing 'cause I thought nothing of it.
Exactly, that's the problem.
You don't think about shit.
You don't consider the consequences and you have no respect.
Man, you said I could trust you, Reg.
- You didn't do what I asked.
- Wait, wait.
And you disrespected a woman.
Man, just get up out of my face right now.
- What are you talking about?
- I ain't got shit to say to you right now, Reggie.
Bounce.
Oh, wow.
Uh... you know what?
Fuck... fuck all y'all.
You don't appreciate me, you don't deserve me.
Nate.
Awkward transition, but I spoke to Dallas.
I told them that we cleared this mess up.
They're gonna send over an offer today.
Vernon, buddy, it's time-sensitive.
Not now, y'all.
Look, I got to drive this shit off.
Hopefully there ain't no jizz on my seats.
Mr. Anderson.
Good, good, hoped to catch you.
I better not miss my tee time.
- No, I just need a minute.
- 60 seconds, go.
Ahem.
I just want to let you know
I don't think the whole boat mess was a joke.
Party got insane, yeah, but we never lost focus of what we were there to do and we accomplished our goal.
Yeah, you used my bling to get laid.
I didn't get laid.
Yet another colossal failure on your part.
- Thank you, Lanaia.
- You're welcome.
Failure?
This whole sports division was my idea.
At least give me credit for that.
It was a pretty good idea.
And I brought Spencer in when you didn't want him.
- He's exceeded my expectations.
- Mine, too.
Mr. Anderson, Spencer and I are a team.
If you like his work, you like mine.
But he's Spencer Strasmore and you're...
You're just Joe Krutel.
Gold medalist in being a pain in my butt.
I feel like I put something to rest, you know?
Gained some clarity.
After I passed the CT exam, it's like new doors have been opening.
- That's great, Spencer.
- Yeah.
I double-checked your results and nothing's changed.
- It's all clear.
- Ah, good.
I just wanted to be absolutely sure.
Kind of pulled an Usain Bolt out of here last time.
I believe the starting gun was my suggesting that you see a psychologist.
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just really excited to get the good news.
I couldn't wait to shout it to the world.
- Mm, but now you're back.
- Yeah.
Follow-up never killed anybody.
You still having the nightmares?
Flashbacks.
I drilled a guy and knocked him out of the game.
Suffer any permanent damage?
- Me or him?
- Him, Spencer.
He never played again.
I see.
Was it a clean hit?
Well, depends on who you ask.
No flags on the play, though.
But now I keep seeing his commercials all over TV.
Dan's Auto Collision.
It's fucking weird.
Dan Balsamo.
I love those commercials.
Look, just nut up and go see the guy already.
Doc, you watch your language.
I'm happy to help, Spencer, but this isn't what I do.
You need to go talk to a psychologist.
Why?
I don't need a psychologist.
I'm talking to you.
Bye, Spencer.
Hi, Dan's Auto Collision.
This is Kerri.
Hi, yeah, I'm calling about an accident I just had.
I need some help.
Sure, where can we find you?
I'm at the medical park on the corner of Biscayne and 74th in a white Range Rover.
Pretty bad shape.
You can't miss it.
Oh, and by the way, if you could send Dan...
He's an old friend.
Okay, I'll send him right away.
All right.
Great.
Thank you.
I'll see you soon.
Man, I think you need to call somebody.
Yep, already did.
This better be important, man.
Julie would kill me if she find out I was back over here.
Relax, all right?
Me and the boys cooked up something special for you.
Or this guy did.
A little TTD surprise just for you, Chuck.
Ooh!
This is a testimonial of the finest moments in the career of the great Charles Greane.
A career that seemed dead has now risen from the ashes like a phoenix.
Charles, there's an old saying in the National Football League.
Hands are great, but feet are better.
And you, my friend, had the best feet I have ever witnessed.
You were the Baryshnikov of football.
Your teammates used to call you the Black Swan, for crying out loud, 'cause you were so graceful, you were so nimble.
You owned that line of scrimmage.
Word on the street is Black Swan's coming back.
The game needs you, you need the game.
Freddy T, my rookie year, told me the game's like a roller coaster, buddy.
So get your ass in gear.
See you in Foxboro.
It's gonna be nice and cold.
It ain't gonna be Miami muggy.
Black Swan was a monster.
Seriously, there was no getting around the dude.
That's right.
Whenever I thought I had a clear path to the quarterback, he always came back and shut that shit down.
You should still be playing, big man.
Hey, Charles, if you have any itch to still play, you scratch that son of a bitch off until it bleeds, buddy.
Brother, get back in the game.
I'll see you in Foxboro, buddy.
Let's go a few more rounds, motherfucker.
You need somebody to train you?
Call me.
I'm your guy.
Ha!
That's what I'm talking about.
Feeling that, Charles?
That's an inspirational TTD joint right there.
Did you like it?
- Can you run it back?
- Absolutely, man.
No doubt, man.
Hey, the graphics... great touch, man.
Outstanding, brother.
Holy shit.
Blindsided again.
Dan, long time no see.
What do you want?
Well, got a little car trouble.
And, man, I've been seeing your ads all over TV and figured I'd throw a little business your way.
Don't need your business.
Hey, Dan.
You won't even give me a tow?
You wrecked your car as an excuse to talk to me?
- That's sad.
- Come on.
You crazy?
You tried to exit on the wrong side of the road.
What?
No, I didn't.
The sun was in my eyes.
You're wearing sunglasses.
Shit.
Shit.
The glasses.
Man, look, my car is busted.
I can't take it anywhere.
I just need a tow.
We don't even have to talk.
And I swear to God I won't bring up the hit.
The what?
I just need a ride.
Please?
So you got married?
From the commercial.
That's real cool, man.
You guys got kids?
Yeah, I bet you got kids.
Love this song, too.
Hell of a jam.
Hey, you got a son.
That's great.
Had a feeling you were a dad.
You know, not many guys go from SMU to the league, especially after the death penalty.
That's pretty goddamn impressive, man.
I told you I don't want to fucking talk about it.
Well, I do want to talk about it.
- I don't care.
- I do care.
- I don't suck dicks.
- I do... not...
You almost got me...
Do that either.
Hon, I brought some stromboli.
I might have overcooked it, but I...
Oh, my God, it's him.
Please, let me take this.
Spencer Strasmore.
It's great to meet you.
- Yeah, hi.
Thank you.
- Hi.
Sure.
This looks great.
Salami or pepperoni?
- Salami.
- Good choice.
Hey, champ!
How'd the scrimmage go?
- Awesome.
- Three for five and two RBls.
- Wow.
- Sweet!
Who's the bald guy?
Oh, that's the plumber.
Toilet's backed up again.
Big man, Spencer Strasmore.
What's your name?
- Adam.
- Adam, it's good to meet you.
I used to play ball with your dad.
- You a Marlins fan?
- I love the Marlins.
Yeah.
That's cool.
Well, hey, you know what?
I happen to have extra tickets to tonight's game if you and your dad want to join me.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yeah, that's really not a good idea.
Please?
Yes, yes!
Please!
Please, Dad.
That sounds like a yes.
Danny, let him take you to the ballgame.
Make him buy you some beers.
Sure you're okay with that?
No, it'd be horrible to have the house all to myself.
What in the world will I do without you?
- Yeah.
- Danny!
All right, we're leaving.
It was good to meet you.
I'll see you tonight, big man.
Bye, Spencer.
I see you're still playing dirty.
- I didn't think you'd be home.
- Hey.
I'm glad you're here.
So what you think?
I gave that to you weeks ago.
I'm just catching up on stuff.
I figure if I put it here, every time I walk through the door,
I'll be thinking of you.
And bananas.
It's symbolic, though.
It reminds me also that I'm done with low-hanging fruit.
I want what's high in the tree.
Reaching for the sky.
I want a coconut.
I want you.
You're my beautiful coconut.
These are yours.
I just came to get my stuff.
You know, Ricky, in the craziest way imaginable, you got me to a place where now I know what I want.
- And it ain't you.
- Who is it, then?
Fucking Birdman?
I don't know.
I just know that if I don't salvage what's left of my self-respect, I'll never find it.
When you do, tell him to go fuck himself for me, please?
Listen, you have to want to evolve, okay?
You keep promising and apologizing, but you don't really do it.
I do.
I am.
I'm trying to, okay?
I swear to God, I'm trying to.
Talking about my father on national TV, that was evolving.
And you know what?
I couldn't have ne that without you.
You know, the sad thing is, you're no better than he is.
I'm gonna go get the rest of my stuff.
You don't have to leave that up.
Hey, you didn't tell me they were playing the Yanks tonight.
Holy shit!
Can't wait to see Stanton go yard on them.
- Where'd you get the glove?
- Borrowed it from a neighbor's kid.
- Meaning you stole it.
- I'll fucking return it.
Besides, I figure we're sitting behind the dugout, right?
- Might stab a few lasers.
- What, are you 12?
I'm not bare handing a foul ball.
Right, because you jerk off and catch with the same hand?
You can't take the risk of breaking a finger?
Got me.
Relax.
Any hot chicks come around, I'll just tell them that it's my son's and he was kidnapped and it helps me remember him.
I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but I can't take you to the game tonight.
I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just say that so we can remain friends, 'cause I like you.
I like you, too.
I'm sorry, but something came up.
Aw, come on, man.
What does that mean, huh?
You can't just disinvite me.
Joe, I'm sorry, okay?
I promise you, I'm gonna get you next time.
Who is she, huh?
She better have a magical fucking vagina.
It's not a woman.
It's Old Man Anderson, isn't it?
Why the fuck would I dump you for Old Man Anderson?
Because he's been showering you with praise ever since you got those pictures back from Angie.
Ever since we got those pictures back from Angie.
Okay?
And I made sure he knows that.
Did you tell him that while you were on Snapchat together?
You sound like a jealous chick, buddy.
Listen, listen.
Be careful with him.
Watch your ass, all right?
You think life in the league was hard?
I've seen him shoot 20 guys in the back of the head.
They don't show up the next day.
They're just gone.
The bodies are buried all over Boca.
Joe, Joe, Joe.
For the last time, it's not Anderson.
Hey, a lot of vacancy in Coral Gables.
Might be a nice place to set up our own shop.
Hey, it's Jason.
Let's see how that Dallas offer came in.
Yeah.
Hey, buddy.
Here at the office with Joe.
- What's good?
- Dallas came in big.
"Wide World of Sports" big.
Lead story on "SportsCenter" big.
Everybody's gonna be talking about this.
$45 million guaranteed.
Wow.
That is amazing.
Higher than their last offer.
You're the best agent in the business, buddy.
Well, the best agent in the business can't seem to find his client.
He's a 265-pound defensive tackle in an orange McLaren.
- He's kind of hard to miss.
- Did you call Mama?
Marcus?
I did, you know, and Dallas wants an answer now, but I'm afraid he's wrapped himself up in tin foil and is talking to aliens or some shit.
Did you try that laser tag place he's always talking about?
You know, Joe, that's not even remotely helpful, but thank you.
Call me when he surfaces.
Well, might not want to tell your new best friend Anderson about this at the game tonight.
Wow, still chickish.
Violent hands.
I want you violent at the point of attack.
You need a nap, Charles?
We got time.
- No, sir.
Here we go, I'm ready.
- Come on.
Quit holding.
You're clicking your heels, Greane.
Widen your stance.
Kick, slide.
Kick, slide.
Basics.
Come on, man.
Didn't you win a fucking Super Bowl, Greane?
- Yes, I did.
- A lot of rust.
How much do you want this comeback, sugar tits?
- More than anything, sir.
- I don't believe you.
Let's go.
Come on.
Maybe you'd rather see a truck, sugar tits.
Let's go again.
Yo!
- Hey, Sally.
- Hi.
I only got two.
Do you mind if the kid slips in?
No problem, Spence.
Enjoy the game, sweetheart.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
What?
This is the life of Spencer Strasmore.
"Okay if the kid slips in with us?"
"No problem, Spence." Must be brutal.
- It's not always that way.
- Just 99% of the time?
Look, I didn't come here to rub it in your face.
No, you did this out of the goodness of your heart, right?
Which is why you used my kid.
You're a real class act, man.
Hey, Dan, you know what?
We don't have to do this.
I'll leave you guys alone.
You can watch the game by yourselves.
I'll have somebody take you down to the box.
Forget it.
Don't go soft on me, Strasmore.
You're doing a real nice thing here.
- I'll ease up on you.
- You promise?
- I'm a sensitive man.
- Sensitive?
- Yeah.
- You're sensitive?
- Jesus.
- Kind of big, too.
After all I've done for that bald, multicultural motherfucker, he's gonna hang me out to dry with Anderson?
Me?
Fuck him.
They can fuck each other in the dicks for all I care.
- I'm sorry, dude.
I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
No, Jaime, you're not here to listen to my bullshit all day.
How are you?
Huh?
How you doing?
How's your dog?
- Dog's doing fine.
- Oh, you know what I read the other day?
This is fucked up.
It's a myth that dogs are color-blind.
You know, maybe you'd be better off without this Spencer guy.
- No, no, no.
- Just saying, Joe.
You got to embrace the freedom that comes with being your own boss.
I mean, look at me.
Don't I look happy?
Anyways, I got to run, dude.
- Pick up Grandma.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
All right.
Man.
- Drive safe.
- Yeah.
You got a great kid.
We can cut the bullshit now, dude.
Just tell me what's on your mind.
Okay.
I meant to hurt you that day.
I mean, you were completely exposed.
I could have pulled back, but I didn't.
Instead, I chose to light you the fuck up.
I make no apologies about it.
It's the type of player I was back then.
I'm well aware of that.
It's football.
Players are aware of the risks.
What if it was you that got laid out?
Would you want a handshake, a "no hard feelings"?
Some show of respect?
Dan, I didn't have that in me back then.
I took that hit, I put it in a box and I buried that motherfucker.
That was it.
I moved on.
And for whatever reason, after I retired, that moment's been haunting me.
Look, I know I'm late.
I'm just trying to make it right.
You did me a favor.
Don't say that, man.
I've been dining out on the idea you robbed me of my chance at greatness for years, telling everyone Spencer Strasmore was dirty, when the reality was I was a great college player, but I was a below-average pro.
Come on, man.
You made it to the highest level.
Six teams in eight years.
Man, it got to the point where I stopped making friends 'cause I knew I wouldn't be around long enough to remember everybody's name.
- You never had that problem, did you?
- No.
In all my time in the league, I never scored a TD, played in a playoff game, had a single moment of glory.
Not a cheer from the crowd.
Nothing.
Nothing.
I was chasing something I was never gonna get.
I was done when we met, Spencer.
I mean, do I miss football?
Yeah.
But that hit that you've been losing sleep over, that was a straight-up mercy kill.
I've never told that to anyone.
Better than talking to a shrink.
A hell of a lot cheaper, too.
Check it out.
Check it out.
Giancarlo Stanton.
Giancarlo!
Whoo!
Hi there, Spence.
Come on, I'll introduce you.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, that's my boy.
But I won't introduce you as my fucking plumber, by the way.
Adam.
Adam.
Come on.
- What's up, brother?
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.
How's it going?
Everything is good.
This is one of your biggest fans, Dan Balsamo.
Dan, what's going on, man?
Great to meet you.
Good to meet you.
All right, and this is the big man right here.
What's up, little man?
- How you doing?
- 37 home runs.
- And counting.
- Look at you.
You know your stats.
Want me to sign this?
All right.
Hey, how'd it go?
- You didn't text me.
- Mmm.
No word just yet.
Baby, what happened?
What drills did you run?
You do some pass sets?
Oh, yeah.
A bunch of those.
Some punch drills.
Okay, I want to know more.
Was Siefert cool?
Did you tell him how my aunt grew up in the same town as his mom?
No, I didn't get a chance to do that, baby.
He was kind of busy screaming at me.
The GM was screaming at you?
Mm, yeah.
It was a different side of him I never seen before.
He kept calling me "sugar tits."
A nickname is a good sign.
I really think I blew it.
Everybody counted on me to get it back and I just landed square on my ass.
Oh, baby, it couldn't have been that bad.
No, I literally landed on my ass.
Like right on it.
Right on your ass?
Phew!
Oh, shoot.
Look, nobody wanted this comeback for you more than I did.
You know that.
I'm sorry, baby.
But I do have some news that might ease some of that pain.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I was supposed to have my period a while ago and I didn't, so I took one of these and, bam.
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Yes, I'm sure.
So I'm gonna be a daddy?
Yes.
Ooh, Daddy.
I like that way more than sugar tits.
I love you, baby.
I'm gonna be a daddy.
Commissioner, thank you.
Hey, Spence, shouldn't we get to our seats?
You owe me some beers.
I do owe you beers.
Yeah, but one second.
We direct your attention to the field.
Throwing out our ceremonial first pitch, please welcome Miami Dolphins legend Spencer Strasmore.
Thank you.
Spencer Strasmore is certainly a fan favorite here in Miami.
The former Dolphins defenseman...
It's great to be the king, huh?
Not bad.
Joininghimis former Buffalo Bills running back and owner of Dan's Auto Collision,
Mr. Dan Balsamo and his son, number 11, Adam Balsamo.
Holy shit.
Not a bad plug, huh?
I told your wife to watch.
throw out the first pitch, and that certainly was a great matchup when they were playing head-to-head in the NFL.
Okay.
Thank you, Commish.
Here you go, big man.
All right, let's do this.
Yeah, buddy.
Hey, um, ahem, don't fuck this up.
Not a chance, pal.
beautiful outside the ball park as we're ready to start.
Right in the strike zone, baby.
Go, Danny boy!
Show 'em some heat, Balsamo!
Come on, Danny.
All right, Balsamo.
Balsamo, you suck!
Yeah!

Ah!
I know what the problem is.
None of the players are black.
Whatever, Reg.
Come on, man.
(doorbell rings)
Reggie:
That's my Lionel Messi move right there.
Watch again.
Graceful.
I might be playing the wrong sport, y'all.
- Happy days.
Happy days, fellas.
- Vernon:
Vince!
Angela's got her money and we have all the pictures back on file, everything.
We can finally move on to bigger and better things.
- For real, man.
Thanks, Spencer.
- Come on.
Vernon:
So everything is cool?
Everything is now everything.
(laughs) Okay, everything's everything.
So, what, you gonna swipe my catchphrase now?
Is that it?
Man, chill, Reggie.
I'm just saying we don't have to be slobbering all over the man.
You come here trotting on your high horse like you saved the day.
Let's not forget all this shit was Spencer's fault in the first place.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I just came to deliver good news.
That's what we wanted to do.
Well, next time a fucking phone call will do.
Wow.
Well, you're lucky I didn't call Vernon and tell him about your little joy ride you took with Angie the other night.
- Joy ride?
- He's tripping.
I wish I was tripping.
She gave me the entire rundown last night.
Every gag-inducing detail.
Man, what the fuck you do now, Reggie?
Nothing.
I took her home just like you asked me to.
And we were bonding over what an asshole Spencer is.
But I wasn't the fucking asshole who disrespected her and made her take the bus home.
- You did what?
- She jumped out the car.
Because you pulled your pecker out at the stoplight.
Reggie:
Listen, man, we was getting along.
I thought she wanted to fuck.
So that's your move?
Pull out your dick?
Reggie:
What's the big deal?
What's the big deal?
You offered to pay her.
Everyone got the right to get paid.
Jason:
What the fuck is wrong with you, Reggie?
Reg, hey, you treated her like a piece of meat.
- Angie didn't deserve that.
- I thought she was a ho.
That shit ain't right, Reg.
Ange, she cool.
She ain't even a ho like that.
That's discriminatory.
My cousin Felicia, cooler than a mother.
But she an enormous ho.
I mean, suck your dick through your jeans.
What?
Felicia ain't cool at all.
I didn't say nothing 'cause I thought nothing of it.
Exactly, that's the problem.
You don't think about shit.
You don't consider the consequences and you have no respect.
Man, you said I could trust you, Reg.
- You didn't do what I asked.
- Wait, wait.
And you disrespected a woman.
Man, just get up out of my face right now.
- What are you talking about?
- I ain't got shit to say to you right now, Reggie.
Bounce.
Oh, wow.
(scoffs)
Uh... you know what?
Fuck... fuck all y'all.
You don't appreciate me, you don't deserve me.
Nate.
(door opens, closes)
Awkward transition, but I spoke to Dallas.
I told them that we cleared this mess up.
They're gonna send over an offer today. (laughs)
Vernon, buddy, it's time-sensitive.
Not now, y'all.
Look, I got to drive this shit off.
Hopefully there ain't no jizz on my seats.
(door opens, closes)
Mr. Anderson.
Good, good, hoped to catch you.
I better not miss my tee time.
- No, I just need a minute.
- 60 seconds, go.
Ahem.
I just want to let you know
I don't think the whole boat mess was a joke.
Party got insane, yeah, but we never lost focus of what we were there to do and we accomplished our goal.
Yeah, you used my bling to get laid.
I didn't get laid.
Yet another colossal failure on your part.
- Thank you, Lanaia.
- You're welcome.
Failure?
This whole sports division was my idea.
At least give me credit for that.
It was a pretty good idea.
And I brought Spencer in when you didn't want him.
- He's exceeded my expectations.
- Mine, too.
Mr. Anderson, Spencer and I are a team.
If you like his work, you like mine.
But he's Spencer Strasmore and you're...
You're just Joe Krutel.
Gold medalist in being a pain in my butt.
- (door closes) - (engine starts)
I feel like I put something to rest, you know?
Gained some clarity.
After I passed the CT exam, it's like new doors have been opening.
- That's great, Spencer.
- Yeah.
I double-checked your results and nothing's changed.
- It's all clear.
- Ah, good.
I just wanted to be absolutely sure.
Kind of pulled an Usain Bolt out of here last time.
(laughs) I believe the starting gun was my suggesting that you see a psychologist.
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just really excited to get the good news.
I couldn't wait to shout it to the world.
- Mm, but now you're back.
- Yeah.
Follow-up never killed anybody.
You still having the nightmares?
Flashbacks.
I drilled a guy and knocked him out of the game.
Suffer any permanent damage?
- Me or him?
- Him, Spencer.
He never played again.
I see.
Was it a clean hit?
Well, depends on who you ask.
No flags on the play, though.
But now I keep seeing his commercials all over TV.
Dan's Auto Collision.
It's fucking weird.
Dan Balsamo.
I love those commercials.
Look, just nut up and go see the guy already.
Doc, you watch your language. (laughs)
I'm happy to help, Spencer, but this isn't what I do.
You need to go talk to a psychologist.
Why?
I don't need a psychologist.
I'm talking to you.
Bye, Spencer.
(ringing)
Woman:
Hi, Dan's Auto Collision.
This is Kerri.
Hi, yeah, I'm calling about an accident I just had.
I need some help.
Sure, where can we find you?
I'm at the medical park on the corner of Biscayne and 74th in a white Range Rover.
Pretty bad shape.
You can't miss it.
Oh, and by the way, if you could send Dan...
He's an old friend.
Okay, I'll send him right away.
All right.
Great.
Thank you.
I'll see you soon.
(music playing)
(sighs)
(engine starts)
(gearshift clicks)
(tires squeal)
- (tires pop) - (brakes squeal)
Man, I think you need to call somebody.
Yep, already did.
This better be important, man.
Julie would kill me if she find out I was back over here.
Relax, all right?
Me and the boys cooked up something special for you.
Or this guy did.
A little TTD surprise just for you, Chuck.
- Ooh!
- (laughs)
- (music playing on TV) - (crowd cheering)
Ricky's voice:
This is a testimonial of the finest moments in the career of the great Charles Greane.
A career that seemed dead has now risen from the ashes like a phoenix.
Schlereth:
Charles, there's an old saying in the National Football League.
Hands are great, but feet are better.
And you, my friend, had the best feet I have ever witnessed.
You were the Baryshnikov of football.
Your teammates used to call you the Black Swan, for crying out loud, 'cause you were so graceful, you were so nimble.
You owned that line of scrimmage.
Word on the street is Black Swan's coming back.
The game needs you, you need the game.
Freddy T, my rookie year, told me the game's like a roller coaster, buddy.
So get your ass in gear.
See you in Foxboro.
It's gonna be nice and cold.
It ain't gonna be Miami muggy.
Black Swan was a monster.
Seriously, there was no getting around the dude.
That's right.
Whenever I thought I had a clear path to the quarterback, he always came back and shut that shit down.
You should still be playing, big man.
(grunting) Hey, Charles, if you have any itch to still play, you scratch that son of a bitch off until it bleeds, buddy.
Brother, get back in the game.
I'll see you in Foxboro, buddy.
Let's go a few more rounds, motherfucker.
You need somebody to train you?
Call me.
I'm your guy.
- (glass shatters) - (grunting)
Ha!
That's what I'm talking about.
Feeling that, Charles?
That's an inspirational TTD joint right there.
Did you like it?
- Can you run it back?
- Ricky:
Absolutely, man.
No doubt, man.
Hey, the graphics... great touch, man.
Outstanding, brother.
Holy shit.
Blindsided again.
Dan, long time no see.
What do you want?
Well, got a little car trouble.
And, man, I've been seeing your ads all over TV and figured I'd throw a little business your way.
Don't need your business.
Hey, Dan.
You won't even give me a tow?
You wrecked your car as an excuse to talk to me?
- That's sad.
- (laughs) Come on.
You crazy?
You tried to exit on the wrong side of the road.
What?
No, I didn't.
The sun was in my eyes.
You're wearing sunglasses.
(laughs)
Shit.
Shit.
The glasses.
Man, look, my car is busted.
I can't take it anywhere.
I just need a tow.
We don't even have to talk.
And I swear to God I won't bring up the hit.
The what?
I just need a ride.
Please?

That's pretty goddamn impressive, man.
I told you I don't want to fucking talk about it.
Well, I do want to talk about it.

Spencer Strasmore.
It's great to meet you.
- Yeah, hi.
Thank you.
- Hi.
Sure.
This looks great.
Salami or pepperoni?
- Salami.
- Good choice.
Hey, champ!
How'd the scrimmage go?
- Awesome.
- Three for five and two RBls.
- Wow.
- Dan:
Sweet!
(whispers) Who's the bald guy?
Oh, that's the plumber.
Toilet's backed up again.
Big man, Spencer Strasmore.
What's your name?
- Adam.
- Adam, it's good to meet you.
I used to play ball with your dad.
- You a Marlins fan?
- I love the Marlins.
Yeah.
That's cool.
Well, hey, you know what?
I happen to have extra tickets to tonight's game if you and your dad want to join me.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yeah, that's really not a good idea.
Adam:
Please?
Yes, yes!
Please!
Please, Dad.
That sounds like a yes.
Danny, let him take you to the ballgame.
Make him buy you some beers.
Sure you're okay with that?
No, it'd be horrible to have the house all to myself.
What in the world will I do without you?
- Yeah.
- Danny!
All right, we're leaving.
It was good to meet you.
I'll see you tonight, big man.
Bye, Spencer.
I see you're still playing dirty.
- (music playing) - (door opens)
- I didn't think you'd be home.
- Hey.
I'm glad you're here.
So what you think?
I gave that to you weeks ago.
I'm just catching up on stuff.
I figure if I put it here, every time I walk through the door,
I'll be thinking of you.
And bananas.
It's symbolic, though.
It reminds me also that I'm done with low-hanging fruit.
I want what's high in the tree.
Reaching for the sky.
I want a coconut.
I want you.
You're my beautiful coconut.
These are yours.
I just came to get my stuff.
You know, Ricky, in the craziest way imaginable, you got me to a place where now I know what I want.
- And it ain't you.
- Who is it, then?
Fucking Birdman?
I don't know.
I just know that if I don't salvage what's left of my self-respect, I'll never find it.
When you do, tell him to go fuck himself for me, please?
Listen, you have to want to evolve, okay?
You keep promising and apologizing, but you don't really do it.
I do.
I am.
I'm trying to, okay?
I swear to God, I'm trying to.
Talking about my father on national TV, that was evolving.
And you know what?
I couldn't have ne that without you.
You know, the sad thing is, you're no better than he is.
I'm gonna go get the rest of my stuff.
You don't have to leave that up.
- (phones ringing) - (chatter)
Hey, you didn't tell me they were playing the Yanks tonight.
Holy shit!
Can't wait to see Stanton go yard on them.
- Where'd you get the glove?
- Borrowed it from a neighbor's kid.
- Meaning you stole it.
- I'll fucking return it.
Besides, I figure we're sitting behind the dugout, right?
- Might stab a few lasers.
- What, are you 12?
I'm not bare handing a foul ball.
Right, because you jerk off and catch with the same hand?
You can't take the risk of breaking a finger?
- (mock laughing)
- Got me.
Relax.
Any hot chicks come around, I'll just tell them that it's my son's and he was kidnapped and it helps me remember him.
I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but I can't take you to the game tonight.
I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just say that so we can remain friends, 'cause I like you.
I like you, too.
I'm sorry, but something came up.
Aw, come on, man.
What does that mean, huh?
You can't just disinvite me.
Joe, I'm sorry, okay?
I promise you, I'm gonna get you next time.
Who is she, huh?
She better have a magical fucking vagina.
- It's not a woman.
- (sighs)
It's Old Man Anderson, isn't it?
Why the fuck would I dump you for Old Man Anderson?
Because he's been showering you with praise ever since you got those pictures back from Angie.
Ever since we got those pictures back from Angie.
Okay?
And I made sure he knows that.
Did you tell him that while you were on Snapchat together?
You sound like a jealous chick, buddy.
Listen, listen.
Be careful with him.
Watch your ass, all right?
You think life in the league was hard?
I've seen him shoot 20 guys in the back of the head.
They don't show up the next day.
They're just gone.
The bodies are buried all over Boca.
Joe, Joe, Joe.
For the last time, it's not Anderson.
Hey, a lot of vacancy in Coral Gables.
Might be a nice place to set up our own shop.
(phone rings)
Hey, it's Jason.
Let's see how that Dallas offer came in.
Yeah.
Hey, buddy.
Here at the office with Joe.
- What's good?
- Dallas came in big.
"Wide World of Sports" big.
Lead story on "SportsCenter" big.
Everybody's gonna be talking about this.
$45 million guaranteed.
- (hums "SportsCenter" theme)
- Wow.
That is amazing.
Higher than their last offer.
You're the best agent in the business, buddy.
Well, the best agent in the business can't seem to find his client.
He's a 265-pound defensive tackle in an orange McLaren.
- He's kind of hard to miss.
- Did you call Mama?
Marcus?
Jason:
I did, you know, and Dallas wants an answer now, but I'm afraid he's wrapped himself up in tin foil and is talking to aliens or some shit.
Did you try that laser tag place he's always talking about?
You know, Joe, that's not even remotely helpful, but thank you.
Call me when he surfaces.
(sighs)
Well, might not want to tell your new best friend Anderson about this at the game tonight.
Wow, still chickish.
- (whistle blows) - (grunting)
(whistle blows)
Violent hands.
I want you violent at the point of attack.
You need a nap, Charles?
We got time.
- No, sir.
Here we go, I'm ready.
- Come on.
- (whistle blows) - (grunting)
Quit holding.
You're clicking your heels, Greane.
Widen your stance.
Kick, slide.
Kick, slide.
Basics.
Come on, man.
Didn't you win a fucking Super Bowl, Greane?
- Yes, I did.
- A lot of rust.
How much do you want this comeback, sugar tits?
- More than anything, sir.
- I don't believe you.
- Let's go.
- (whistle blows)
- Come on.
- (grunting)
(whistle blows)
Maybe you'd rather see a truck, sugar tits.
Coach:
Let's go again.
(chatter)
Yo!
- Hey, Sally.
- Hi.
I only got two.
Do you mind if the kid slips in?
No problem, Spence.
Enjoy the game, sweetheart.
- (laughs) Bye.
- Thank you.
- (Dan laughs)
- Spencer:
What?
This is the life of Spencer Strasmore.
"Okay if the kid slips in with us?"
"No problem, Spence." Must be brutal.
- It's not always that way.
- Just 99% of the time?
Look, I didn't come here to rub it in your face.
No, you did this out of the goodness of your heart, right?
Which is why you used my kid.
You're a real class act, man.
Hey, Dan, you know what?
We don't have to do this.
I'll leave you guys alone.
You can watch the game by yourselves.
I'll have somebody take you down to the box.
Forget it.
Don't go soft on me, Strasmore.
You're doing a real nice thing here.
- I'll ease up on you.
- You promise?
- I'm a sensitive man.
- Sensitive?
- Yeah.
- You're sensitive?
- Jesus.
- Kind of big, too.
After all I've done for that bald, multicultural motherfucker, he's gonna hang me out to dry with Anderson?
Me?
Fuck him.
They can fuck each other in the dicks for all I care.
(sighs)
- I'm sorry, dude.
I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
No, Jaime, you're not here to listen to my bullshit all day.
How are you?
Huh?
How you doing?
How's your dog?
- Dog's doing fine.
- Oh, you know what I read the other day?
This is fucked up.
It's a myth that dogs are color-blind.
(laughs)
You know, maybe you'd be better off without this Spencer guy.
- No, no, no.
- Just saying, Joe.
You got to embrace the freedom that comes with being your own boss.
I mean, look at me.
Don't I look happy?
Anyways, I got to run, dude.
- Pick up Grandma.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
All right.
Man.
- Drive safe.
- Yeah.
(crowd cheering)
You got a great kid.
We can cut the bullshit now, dude.
Just tell me what's on your mind.
Okay.
I meant to hurt you that day.
I mean, you were completely exposed.
I could have pulled back, but I didn't.
Instead, I chose to light you the fuck up.
I make no apologies about it.
It's the type of player I was back then.
I'm well aware of that.
It's football.
Players are aware of the risks.
What if it was you that got laid out?
Would you want a handshake, a "no hard feelings"?
Some show of respect?
Dan, I didn't have that in me back then.
I took that hit, I put it in a box and I buried that motherfucker.
That was it.
I moved on.
And for whatever reason, after I retired, that moment's been haunting me.
Look, I know I'm late.
I'm just trying to make it right.
You did me a favor.
Don't say that, man.
I've been dining out on the idea you robbed me of my chance at greatness for years, telling everyone Spencer Strasmore was dirty, when the reality was I was a great college player, but I was a below-average pro.
Come on, man.
You made it to the highest level.
Six teams in eight years.
Man, it got to the point where I stopped making friends 'cause I knew I wouldn't be around long enough to remember everybody's name.
- You never had that problem, did you?
- No.
In all my time in the league, I never scored a TD, played in a playoff game, had a single moment of glory.
Not a cheer from the crowd.
Nothing.
Nothing.
I was chasing something I was never gonna get.
I was done when we met, Spencer.
I mean, do I miss football?
Yeah.
But that hit that you've been losing sleep over, that was a straight-up mercy kill.
I've never told that to anyone.
(groans)
Better than talking to a shrink.
A hell of a lot cheaper, too.
(both laugh)
Check it out.
Check it out.
Giancarlo Stanton.
Giancarlo!
Whoo!
Hi there, Spence.
Come on, I'll introduce you.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, that's my boy.
But I won't introduce you as my fucking plumber, by the way.
Adam.
Adam.
Come on.
- What's up, brother?
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.
How's it going?
Everything is good.
This is one of your biggest fans, Dan Balsamo.
Dan, what's going on, man?
Great to meet you.
Good to meet you.
All right, and this is the big man right here.
What's up, little man?
- How you doing?
- 37 home runs.
- And counting.
- Look at you.
You know your stats.
Want me to sign this?
All right.
Hey, how'd it go?
- You didn't text me.
- Mmm.
No word just yet.
Baby, what happened?
What drills did you run?
You do some pass sets?
Oh, yeah.
A bunch of those.
Some punch drills.
Okay, I want to know more.
Was Siefert cool?
Did you tell him how my aunt grew up in the same town as his mom?
No, I didn't get a chance to do that, baby.
He was kind of busy screaming at me.
The GM was screaming at you?
Mm, yeah.
It was a different side of him I never seen before.
He kept calling me "sugar tits."
A nickname is a good sign.
I really think I blew it.
Everybody counted on me to get it back and I just landed square on my ass.
Oh, baby, it couldn't have been that bad.
No, I literally landed on my ass.
Like right on it.
Right on your ass?
Phew!
Oh, shoot.
Look, nobody wanted this comeback for you more than I did.
You know that.
I'm sorry, baby.
But I do have some news that might ease some of that pain.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I was supposed to have my period a while ago and I didn't, so I took one of these and, bam.
(laughs)
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.
(laughs) Yes, I'm sure.
So I'm gonna be a daddy?
Yes.
Ooh, Daddy.
I like that way more than sugar tits.
(laughs)
I love you, baby.
I'm gonna be a daddy.
(crowd cheering)
Commissioner, thank you.
Hey, Spence, shouldn't we get to our seats?
You owe me some beers.
I do owe you beers.
Yeah, but one second.
Announcer:
We direct your attention to the field.
Throwing out our ceremonial first pitch, please welcome Miami Dolphins legend Spencer Strasmore.
(cheering)
Thank you.
Commentator:
Spencer Strasmore is certainly a fan favorite here in Miami.
The former Dolphins defenseman...
It's great to be the king, huh?
Not bad.
Joininghimis former Buffalo Bills running back and owner of Dan's Auto Collision,
Mr. Dan Balsamo and his son, number 11, Adam Balsamo.
- Holy shit.
- (crowd cheering)
Not a bad plug, huh?
I told your wife to watch.
Commentator: throw out the first pitch, and that certainly was a great matchup when they were playing head-to-head in the NFL.
Okay.
Thank you, Commish.
Here you go, big man.
All right, let's do this.
Yeah, buddy.
Hey, um, ahem, don't fuck this up.
Not a chance, pal.
Commentator: beautiful outside the ball park as we're ready to start.
- (crowd cheering) - (Spencer chuckles)
(cheering continues)
Woman:
Right in the strike zone, baby.
Man:
Go, Danny boy!
Show 'em some heat, Balsamo!
Come on, Danny.
Man:
All right, Balsamo.
(groans)
(crowd booing)
(laughing)
(crowd booing)
Man:
Balsamo, you suck!
Yeah!

(EXCLAIMING)
I know what the problem is.
None of the players are black.
- Whatever, Reg.
Come on, man.
-(DOORBELL RINGS)
REGGIE:
That's my Lionel Messi move right there.
Watch again.
Graceful.
I might be playing the wrong sport, y'all.
- Happy days.
Happy days, fellas.
- VERNON:
Vince!
Angela's got her money and we have all the pictures back on file, everything.
We can finally move on to bigger and better things.
- For real, man.
Thanks, Spencer.
- SPENCER:
Come on.
VERNON:
So everything is cool?
SPENCER:
Everything is now everything.
Okay, everything's everything.
So, what, you gonna swipe my catchphrase now?
ls that it?
Man, chill, Reggie.
I'm just saying we don't have to be slobbering all over the man.
You come here trotting on your high horse like you saved the day.
Let's not forget all this shit was Spencer's fault in the first place.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I just came to deliver good news.
That's what we wanted to do.
Well, next time... (SCOFFS) A fucking phone call will do.
Wow.
Well, you're lucky I didn't call Vernon and tell him about your little joy ride you took with Angie the other night.
- Joy ride?
- He's tripping
SPENCER:
I wish I was tripping.
She gave me the entire rundown last night.
Every gag-inducing detail.
Man, what the fuck you do now, Reggie?
Nothing.
I took her home just like you asked me to.
And we were bonding over what an asshole Spencer is.
But I wasn't the fucking asshole who disrespected her and made her take the bus home.
- You did what?
- She jumped out the car.
Because you pulled your pecker out at the stoplight.
Listen, man, we was getting along.
I thought she wanted to fuck.
So that's your move?
Pull out your dick?
REGGIE:
What's the big deal?
What's the big deal?
You offered to pay her.
Everyone got the right to get paid.
JASON:
What the fuck is wrong with you, Reggie?
Reg, hey, you treated her like a piece of meat.
- Angie didn't deserve that.
- I thought she was a ho.
That shit ain't right, Reg.
Ange, she cool.
She ain't even a ho like that.
That's discriminatory.
My cousin Felicia, cooler than a mother.
But she an enormous ho.
I mean, suck your dick through your jeans.
What?
Felicia ain't cool at all.
I didn't say nothing 'cause I thought nothing of it.
Exactly, that's the problem.
You don't think about shit.
You don't consider the consequences and you have no respect.
Man, you said I could trust you, Reg.
- You didn't do what I asked.
- Wait, wait.
And you disrespected a woman.
Man, just get up out of my face right now.
REGGIE:
What are you talking about?
I ain't got shit to say to you right now, Reggie.
Bounce.
Oh, wow.
(SCOFFS)
Uh... (STAMMERS)
You know what?
Fuck...
Fuck all y'all.
You don't appreciate me, you don't deserve me.
Nate.
(SIGHS)
Awkward transition, but I spoke to Dallas.
I told them that we cleared this mess up.
They're gonna send over an offer today.
Vernon, buddy, it's time-sensitive.
Not now, y'all.
Look, I got to drive this shit off.
Hopefully there ain't no jizz on my seats.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
JOE:
Mr. Anderson.
Good, good, hoped to catch you.
I better not miss my tee time.
- No, I just need a minute.
-60 seconds, go.
(CLEARS THROAT) Um...
I just want to let you know I don't think the whole boat mess was a joke.
Party got insane, yeah, but we never lost focus of what we were there to do and we accomplished our goal.
Yeah, you used my bling to get laid.
I didn't get laid.
Yet another colossal failure on your part.
- Thank you, Lanaia.
- You're welcome.
Failure?
This whole sports division was my idea.
At least give me credit for that.
It was a pretty good idea.
And I brought Spencer in when you didn't want him.
- He's exceeded my expectations.
- Mine, too.
Mr. Anderson, Spencer and I are a team.
If you like his work, you like mine.
But he's Spencer Strasmore and you're...
You're just Joe Krutel.
Gold medalist in being a pain in my butt.
-(CAR DOOR CLOSES) -(ENGINE STARTS)
I feel like I put something to rest, you know?
Gained some clarity.
After I passed the CT exam, it's like new doors have been opening.
- That's great, Spencer.
- Yeah.
I double-checked your results and nothing's changed.
- It's all clear.
- Ah, good.
I just wanted to be absolutely sure.
Kind of pulled an Usain Bolt out of here last time.
(LAUGHS) I believe the starting gun was my suggesting that you see a psychologist.
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just really excited to get the good news.
I couldn't wait to shout it to the world.
- Mmm, but now you're back.
- Yeah.
Follow-up never killed anybody.
You still having the nightmares?
Flashbacks.
I drilled a guy and knocked him out of the game.
Suffer any permanent damage?
- Me or him?
- Him, Spencer.
He never played again.
I see.
Was it a clean hit?
Well, depends on who you ask.
No flags on the play, though.
But now I keep seeing his commercials all over TV.
Dan's Auto Collision.
It's fucking weird.
Dan Balsamo.
I love those commercials.
Look, just nut up and go see the guy already.
Doc, you watch your language. (LAUGHS)
I'm happy to help, Spencer, but this isn't what I do.
You need to go talk to a psychologist.
Why?
I don't need a psychologist.
I'm talking to you.
Bye, Spencer.
(DIALING)
(ON PHONE) Hi, Dan's Auto Collision.
This is Kerri.
Hi, yeah, I'm calling about an accident I just had.
I need some help.
Sure, where can we find you?
I'm at the medical park on the corner of Biscayne and 74th in a white Range Rover.
Pretty bad shape.
You can't miss it.
And by the way, if you could send Dan...
He's an old friend.
Okay, I'll send him right away.
All right.
Great.
Thank you.
I'll see you soon.

- Or this guy did.
- A little TTD surprise just for you, Chuck.
- Ooh!

-(MUSIC PLAYING ON TV) -(CROWD CHEERING)
RICKY: (ON TV) This is a testimonial of the finest moments in the career of the great Charles Greane.
A career that seemed dead has now risen from the ashes like a phoenix.
SCHLERETH:
Charles, there's an old saying in the National Football League.
Hands are great, but feet are better.
And you, my friend, had the best feet I have ever witnessed.
You were the Baryshnikov of football.
Your teammates used to call you the Black Swan, for crying out loud, 'cause you were so graceful, you were so nimble.
You owned that line of scrimmage.
Word on the street is Black Swan's coming back.
The game needs you, you need the game.
Freddy T, my rookie year, told me the game's like a roller coaster, buddy.
So get your ass in gear.
See you in Foxborough.
It's gonna be nice and cold.
It ain't gonna be Miami muggy.
Black Swan was a monster.
Seriously, there was no getting around the dude.
That's right.
Whenever I thought I had a clear path to the quarterback, he always came back and shut that shit down.
You should still be playing, big man.
(GRUNTING) Hey, Charles, if you have any itch to still play, you scratch that son of a bitch off until it bleeds, buddy.
Brother, get back in the game.
I'll see you in Foxborough, buddy.
Let's go a few more rounds, motherfucker.
You need somebody to train you?
Call me.
I'm your guy.
-(GLASS SHATTERS) -(GRUNTING)
(EXCLAIMS)
That's what I'm talking about.
Feeling that, Charles?
That's an inspirational TTD joint right there.
Did you like it?
- Can you run it back?
- RICKY:
Absolutely, man.
No doubt, man.
Hey, the graphics, great touch, man.
Outstanding, brother.
Holy shit.
(SPENCER CHUCKLES)
Blindsided again.
Dan, long time no see.
What do you want?
Well, got a little car trouble.
And, man, I've been seeing your ads all over TV and figured I'd throw a little business your way.
Don't need your business.
Hey, Dan.
You won't even give me a tow?
You wrecked your car as an excuse to talk to me?
- That's sad.
-(LAUGHS) Come on.
You crazy?
You tried to exit on the wrong side of the road.
What?
No, I didn't.
The sun was in my eyes.
You're wearing sunglasses.
(LAUGHS)
Shit.
Shit.
The glasses.
Ah, man, look, my car is busted.
I can't take it anywhere.
I just need a tow.
We don't even have to talk.
And I swear to God I won't bring up the hit.
The what?
I just need a ride.
Please?
-(FIGHTIN' SIDE OF ME PLAYING ON RADIO) -(EXHALES)
So you got married?
From the commercial.
That's real cool, man.
You guys got kids?
Yeah, I bet you got kids. (CHUCKLES)
(VOLUME INCREASES)
Love this song, too.
Hell of a jam.
SPENCER:
Hey, you got a son. (CHUCKLES)
That's great.
Had a feeling you were a dad.
You know, not many guys go from SMU to the league, especially after the death penalty.
That's pretty goddamn impressive, man.
I told you I don't want to fucking talk about it.
Well, I do want to talk about it.
- I don't care.
- I do care.
- I don't suck dicks.
- I do...
Not...
You almost got me...
Do that, either. (CHUCKLES)
Hon, I brought some stromboli.
I might have overcooked it, but I...
Oh, my God, it's him.
(SIGHS)
Please, let me take this.
Spencer Strasmore.
It's great to meet you.
- Yeah, hi.
Thank you.
- Hi.
Sure.
This looks great.
Salami or pepperoni?
- Salami.
- Good choice.
Hey, champ!
How'd the scrimmage go?
- Awesome.
- Three for five and two RBIs.
- DAN:
Sweet!
- Wow.
(WHISPERS) Who's the bald guy?
Oh, that's the plumber.
- Toilet's backed up again.
-(CHUCKLES)
Big man, Spencer Strasmore.
What's your name?
- Adam.
- Adam, it's good to meet you.
I used to play ball with your dad.
You a Marlins fan?
- I love the Marlins.
-(CHUCKLES)
Yeah.
That's cool.
Well, hey, you know what?
I happen to have extra tickets to tonight's game if you and your dad want to join me.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yeah, that's really not a good idea.
ADAM:
Please?
Yes, yes!
Please!
Please, Dad.
- That sounds like a yes.
- ADAM:
Please.
Danny, let him take you to the ballgame.
Make him buy you some beers.
Sure you're okay with that?
No, it'd be horrible to have the house all to myself.
- What in the world will I do without you?
- Yeah.
Danny!
All right, we're leaving.
It was good to meet you.
I'll see you tonight, big man.
Bye, Spencer.
I see you're still playing dirty.
-(DOOR OPENS) -(MUSIC PLAYING)
- I didn't think you'd be home.
- Hey. (CHUCKLES)
I'm glad you're here.
So what you think?
I gave that to you weeks ago.
I'm just catching up on stuff.
I figure if I put it here, every time I walk through the door,
I'll be thinking of you.
And bananas.
It's symbolic, though.
It reminds me also that I'm done with low-hanging fruit.
I want what's high in the tree.
Reaching for the sky.
I want a coconut.
I want you.
You're my beautiful coconut.
These are yours.
I just came to get my stuff.
You know, Ricky, in the craziest way imaginable, you got me to a place where now I know what I want.
- And it ain't you.
- Who is it, then?
Fucking Birdman?
I don't know.
I just know that if I don't salvage what's left of my self-respect, I'll never find it.
When you do, tell him to go fuck himself for me, please?
Listen, you have to want to evolve, okay?
You keep promising and apologizing, but you don't really do it.
I do. I am.
I'm trying to, okay?
I swear to God, I'm trying to.
Talking about my father on national TV, that was evolving.
And you know what?
I couldn't have done that without you.
You know, the sad thing is, you're no better than he is.
I'm gonna go get the rest of my stuff.
You don't have to leave that up.

Hey, you didn't tell me they were playing the Yanks tonight.
Holy shit.
Can't wait to see Stanton go yard on them.
- Where'd you get the glove?
- Borrowed it from a neighbor's kid.
Meaning you stole it.
I'll fucking return it.
Besides, I figure we're sitting behind the dugout, right?
- Might stab a few lasers.
- What, are you 12?
I'm not bare handing a foul ball.
Right, because you jerk off and catch with the same hand?
You can't take the risk of breaking a finger?
(MOCK LAUGHING)
Got me.
Relax.
Any hot chicks come around, I'll just tell them that it's my son's and he was kidnapped and it helps me remember him.
I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but I can't take you to the game tonight.
I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just say that so we can remain friends, 'cause I like you.
I like you, too.
I'm sorry, but something came up.
Aw, come on, man.
What does that mean, huh?
You can't just disinvite me.
Joe, I'm sorry, okay?
I promise you, I'm gonna get you next time.
Who is she, huh?
She better have a magical fucking vagina.
It's not a woman.
(SIGHS)
It's Old Man Anderson, isn't it?
Why the fuck would I dump you for Old Man Anderson?
Because he's been showering you with praise ever since you got those pictures back from Angie.
Ever since we got those pictures back from Angie.
Okay?
And I made sure he knows that.
Did you tell him that while you were on Snapchat together?
You sound like a jealous chick, buddy.
(WHISPERING) Listen, listen.
Be careful with him.
Watch your ass, all right?
You think life in the league was hard?
I've seen him shoot 20 guys in the back of the head.
They don't show up the next day.
They're just gone.
The bodies are buried all over Boca.
Joe,Joe,Joe.
For the last time, it's not Anderson.
Hey, a lot of vacancy in Coral Gables.
Might be a nice place to set up our own shop.
(PHONE RINGS)
Hey, it's Jason.
Let's see how that Dallas offer came in.
Yeah.
Hey, buddy.
Here at the office with Joe.
What's good?
JASON: (ON PHONE) Dallas came in big.

Everybody's gonna be talking about this.

-(JASON IMITATING SPORTSCENTER THEME) -(LAUGHS) Wow.
That is amazing.
Higher than their last offer.
You're the best agent in the business, buddy.
Well, the best agent in the business can't seem to find his client.
He's a 265-pound defensive tackle in an orange McLaren.
- He's kind of hard to miss.
- Did you call Mama?
Marcus?
JASON:
I did, you know, and Dallas wants an answer now, but I'm afraid he's wrapped himself up in tin foil and is talking to aliens or some shit.
Did you try that laser tag place he's always talking about?
You know, Joe, that's not even remotely helpful, but thank you.
Call me when he surfaces.
(SIGHS)
Well, (CLEARS THROAT) might not want to tell your new best friend Anderson about this at the game tonight.
Wow.

- A lot of rust.
How much do you want this comeback, Sugar Tits?
- More than anything, sir.
- I don't believe you.
Let's go.
-(WHISTLE BLOWS)
- Come on!
-(GRUNTS) -(WHISTLE BLOWS)
Maybe you'd rather sell me a truck, Sugar Tits.
COACH:
Let's go again.
(CHATTERING)
Yo!
- Hey, Sally.
- SALLY:
Hi.
I only got two.
Do you mind if the kid slips in?
No problem, Spence.
Enjoy the game, sweetheart.
-(LAUGHS) Bye.
- Thank you.
(DAN LAUGHS)
SPENCER:
What?
DAN:
This is the life of Spencer Strasmore.
"Okay if the kid slips in with us?"
"No problem, Spence." Must be brutal.
- It's not always that way.
- Oh, just 99% of the time?
Hey, look, I didn't come here to rub it in your face.
Well, no, you did this out of the goodness of your heart, right?
Which is why you used my kid.
You're a real class act, man.
Hey, Dan, you know what?
We don't have to do this.
I'll leave you guys alone.
You can watch the game by yourselves.
I'll have somebody take you down to the box.
Forget it.
Don't go soft on me, Strasmore.
You're doing a real nice thing here.
- I'll ease up on you.
- You promise?
- I'm a sensitive man.
- Sensitive?
- Yeah.
-(LAUGHS) You're sensitive?
- Jesus.
- Kind of big, too.
After all I've done for that bald, multicultural motherfucker, he's gonna hang me out to dry with Anderson?
Me?
Fuck him.
They can fuck each other in the dicks for all I care.
(EXHALES)
-I'm sorry, dude.
I'm sorry.
-lt's all right.
No, Jaime, you're not here to listen to my bullshit all day.
How are you, huh?
How you doing?
How's your dog?
- Dog's doing fine.
- You know what I read the other day?
This is fucked up.
It's a myth that dogs are color-blind.
You know, maybe you'd be better off without this Spencer guy.
- No, no, no.
- Just saying, Joe.
You got to embrace the freedom that comes with being your own boss.
I mean, look at me.
Don't I look happy?
Anyways, I got to run, dude.
- Pick up Grandma.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
All right. (SIGHS)
Man.
Call me.
- Drive safe.
- JAIME:
Yeah.
(CROWD CHEERING)
SPENCER:
You got a great kid.
DAN:
We can cut the bullshit now, dude.
Just tell me what's on your mind.
Okay.
I meant to hurt you that day.
I mean, you were completely exposed.
I could have pulled back, but I didn't.
Instead, I chose to light you the fuck up.
I make no apologies about it.
It's the type of player I was back then.
I'm well aware of that.
It's football.
Players are aware of the risks.
What if it was you that got laid out?
Would you want a handshake, a "no hard feelings"?
Some show of respect?
Dan, I didn't have that in me back then.
I took that hit, I put it in a box and I buried that motherfucker.
That was it.
I moved on.
And for whatever reason, after I retired, that moment's been haunting me.
Look, I know I'm late.
I'm just trying to make it right.
You did me a favor.
Don't say that, man.
I've been dining out on the idea you robbed me of my chance at greatness for years, telling everyone Spencer Strasmore was dirty, when the reality was I was a great college player,
but I was a below-average pro.
Come on, man.
You made it to the highest level.
Six teams in eight years.
Man, it got to the point where I stopped making friends 'cause I knew I wouldn't be around long enough to remember everybody's name.
- You never had that problem, did you?
- No.
In all my time in the league, I never scored a TD, played in a playoff game, had a single moment of glory.
Not a cheer from the crowd.
Nothing.
Nothing.
I was chasing something I was never gonna get.
I was done when we met, Spencer.
I mean, do I miss football?
Yeah.
But that hit that you've been losing sleep over, that was a straight-up mercy kill.
I've never told that to anyone.
(CHUCKLES)
-(GROANS) -(SIGHS)
Better than talking to a shrink.
A hell of a lot cheaper, too.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
Check it out.
Check it out.
Giancarlo Stanton.
Giancarlo!
Whoo!
(CHUCKLES) Hi there, Spence.
Come on, I'll introduce you.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, that's my boy.
But I won't introduce you as my fucking plumber, by the way.
Adam.
Adam.
Come on.
- SPENCER:
What's up, brother?
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.
How's it going?
Everything is good.
This is one of your biggest fans, Dan Balsamo.
Dan, what's going on, man?
- Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you.
All right, and this is the big man right here.
GIANCARLO:
What's up, little man?
- How you doing?
-37 home runs.
- And counting.
- Oh!
Look at you.
You know your stats.
Want me to sign this?
All right.
Hey, how'd it go?
You didn't text me.
Mmm.
No word just yet.
Baby, what happened?
What drills did you run?
You do some pass sets?
Oh, yeah.
A bunch of those.
Some punch drills.
Okay, I want to know more.
Was Siefert cool?
Did you tell him how my aunt grew up in the same town as his mom?
No, I didn't get a chance to do that, baby.
He was kind of busy screaming at me.
The GM was screaming at you?
Mmm.
Yeah.
It was a different side of him I never seen before.
He, uh, kept calling me "Sugar Tits."
A nickname is a good sign.
I really think I blew it.
Everybody counted on me to get it back and I just landed square on my ass.
Oh, baby, it couldn't have been that bad.
No, I literally landed on my ass.
Like right on it.
Right on your ass?
(EXCLAIMS)
Aw, shoot.
Look, nobody wanted this comeback for you more than I did.
You know that.
I'm sorry, baby.
But I do have some news that might ease some of that pain.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I was supposed to have my period a while ago and I didn't, so I took one of these and...
Bam.
(LAUGHS)
- Are you sure?
-l'm positive. (LAUGHS)
Yes, I'm sure.
So I'm gonna be a daddy?
Yes.
Ooh!
Daddy.
I like that way more than Sugar Tits.
(LAUGHS)
I love you, baby.
I'm gonna be a daddy. (CHUCKLES)
(CROWD CHEERING)
Commissioner, thank you.
Hey, Spence, shouldn't we get to our seats?
You owe me some beers.
I do owe you beers.
Yeah, but one second.
ANNOUNCER: (ON PA) We direct your attention to the field.
Throwing out our ceremonial first pitch, please welcome Miami Dolphins legend Spencer Strasmore.
(CROWD CHEERING)
Thank you.
COMMENTATOR: (ON TV) Spencer Strasmore is certainly a fan favorite here in Miami.
The former Dolphins defenseman...
DAN:
It's great to be the king, huh?
Not bad.
ANNOUNCER:
Joining him is former Buffalo Bills running back and owner of Dan's Auto Collision,
Mr. Dan Balsamo and his son, number 11, Adam Balsamo.
(CROWD CHEERING)
- Holy shit.
-(SPENCER LAUGHS)
Not a bad plug?
I told your wife to watch.
COMMENT AT OR: (ON TV) ...throw out the first pitch, and that certainly was a great matchup when they were playing head-to-head in the NFL.
Okay.
Thank you, Commish.
Here you go, big man.
All right, let's do this.
Yeah, buddy.
Hey, uh... (CLEARS THROAT) Don't fuck this up.
Not a chance, pal.
COMMENTATOR: ...beautiful outside the ball park as we're ready to start.
-(CROWD CHEERING) -(LAUGHS)
(APPLAUDING)
(SNIFFS)
WOMAN:
Right in the strike zone, baby.
MAN:
Go, Danny boy!
Show 'em some heat, Balsamo!
Come on, Danny.
(CHEERING CONTINUES)
MAN:
All right, Balsamo.
(GROANING)

MAN:
Balsamo, you suck!
Yeah!

Stand up.
Because that is exactly -- i can
Guarantee you, anybody with eyes, ears and a heart and a
Mind, they are standing up back home in america right now.

And dude, there's only one word.
Fantastic.
carson:
Gwen.

Knows that julie andrews and "the sound of music" and that
Song are my favorite ever, ever.
So to be sitting here at the end
Of this year and hear you singing that, i had to hold back
Everything.

If it wasn't for the makeup, it would be done!

Something.

hey,buddy.
I don't have much time to say the things -- to organize my
Thoughts here.
But i'm just going to tell you
That what's amazing about this guy is, not -- my belief in
Jordan is fine.
But jordan's belief in himself
And the humble nature with which he projects that into the world
Is one of the most beautiful things i've ever seen.
And -- he deserves to win the show.
That would be great everything and.
But he is so unbelievably graceful for all that he has.
And is just out there doing what he loves and what he's
Passionate about.
And that to me deserves -- [ cheers and applause ] carson:

About you.
Just how crazy it is to me that
You have such a classic voice.

Said the same thing about you.

True testament to, like, your consistency.
You consistently come out here and do something very classic
Every week.

To blake, because he's a country guy, and -- audience:
Ow!

So incredible as far as country music is concerned, we can tell
What the real deal is.
And if i'm not mistaken, mr.
Shelton, you would not argue.
You are the real deal.
[ cheers and applause ] thankyou.
carson:
Mr.Shelton?
bytheway,thatwasa
Beautiful performance.
I'll tell you the thing that i
Have picked up on and the entire country music fan base out there
That watches this show, that's the reason you're here in the
Finale, is you possess this vocal power.
This range.
You have all of these things,
All of these chops that you're the master.
But the best thing about your performances is, you ramp it up.
You start off simple, and as the song goes along, as the song
Builds, that's when you start throwing in all of the power and
Stuff.
And it makes for these
Incredible performances that you can't look away from.
So unbelievably ahead of your time, sis.
So great.
thankyou.

Part of it.
But i think the thing that gwen
Is talking about is the same thing that i just noticed.
And that's -- i don't know that i've ever worked with anybody
Who puts more heart into their performances than you, barrett.
I mean, every single time you get on that stage, man.
You just lay your heart out there for everybody to see.

Believer of all of us.
So congratulations to making it
This far.

Feeling for you, you know.
To have this journey on the
Season like this.
And to think that, you know, you
Haven't been singing for six years or performing for six
Years.
I can't imagine that you're not
Inspiring somebody who has put down the microphone for a bit
And said i don't want to do this any more, and they're watching
You.
Like you're going to inspire
Somebody to pick it back up and do what they're supposed to do
With their lives.

About you, and that's a good example, "silent night."
Everything you perform, you put your own spin on it.
So there's nobody else out there like you, man.
And that's probably the thing that's going to be the reason
That you go on and you make it in country music after this.
Because there is nobody else on the radio that sounds anything
Like you, man.
Congratulations again.

Pharrell?

Are just ready for you to make a record, man.
[ cheers and applause ] carson:
Thankyou,pharrell.
Adam, i know it might be hard to come up with comments.
But what did you think?
right?
what'sthat?
yeah,right.
That's right.
I have so much -- i only have
Things to say to this guy, because things keep coming up at
Last second.
How could i possibly have
Anything left.
But one thing i just want to
Tell you guys, a little story.
This song, which i had never
Heard before in my life, which is so beautiful.
Is -- it was a last-minute change.
It was not my idea.
It was his idea.
I had another idea.
Not much time.
Please stop it.
With a last-minute change.
And that shows you, and it's something different about this
Guy.
This guy is an artist and he has
A vision.
And i let it go, because it's
His career.
It's his world.
And i'm so happy that i did, because mine wouldn't have been
The right choice.
His was the right choice and i'm
So overjoyed that you made it.
And i applaud you.
[ cheers and applause ] carson:
Giveit up forjordan
Smith.

Let's take a look team blake and emily ann roberts' performance.
It was a burning house.
Enjoy that and we'll see you in
A few minutes.
¶ ¶ i had a dream about
A burning house you were stuck inside
I couldn't get you out ¶ ¶ i laid beside you
And pulled you close and the two of us
Went up in smoke ¶ ¶ love isn't all
That it seems i did you wrong
I'll stay here ¶ ¶ with you
Until this dream is gone
I've been ¶ ¶ sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what's ¶ ¶ lost and broke
And make it right i've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire ¶ ¶ but it's the only place
That i can hold you tight in this burning house
See you at a party ¶ ¶ and you look the same
I could take you back but people don't ever change
Wish that we could ¶ ¶ go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find
Love isn't all ¶ ¶ that it seems
I did you wrong i'll stay here with you
Until this dream ¶ ¶ is gone
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire ¶ ¶ but it's the
Only place that i can hold you tight
In this burning house ¶ ¶ the flames are
Getting bigger now in this burning house
I can hold on ¶ ¶ to you somehow
In this burning house oh and i don't
Wanna wake up ¶ ¶ i been sleepwalking and
Wandering all night ¶ ¶ trying to take what's lost and
Broken and make it right ¶ ¶ i've been sleepwalking to hold
To the fire ¶ ¶ but it's the only place that i
Can hold you tight ¶ ¶ in this burning house ¶ carson:
Allright.
Thank you, coaches.
They're up.
Let's start with gwen.
thatwasmy favoriteofyou so far.
You -- the crazy thing about you is you are -- you're really
Incredible, beautiful singer.
You look incredible.
I want to just look at you the whole night.
But you also know how to deliver the intention of the lyric at 17?
I don't understand how you do
That so well.
I mean -- and you're just
Starting.
I mean, you have a whole life
Ahead of you.
If you start writing songs,
Forget about it.
It's over.
Over, over!
carson:
Andyourcoach,
Blake.
letmetellyou something.
cani justsaysomething?
carson:
Please,please.
flawless.
That was flawless.
[ cheers and applause ] iwouldencouragepeopleto
Take note and vote for what they just heard, because if anybody
In this competition could have just pulled an upset, it was
That right there, sis.
That was unbelievable.
[ cheers and applause ] carson:
Giveit up onemore
Time for emily ann roberts.
Come on in, everybody!
That is going to do it.
We are now just about 15 seconds
Away from going live with our big finale.
Everybody ready?
[ cheers and applause ]
All right.
It's an awesome show.
've got some of the biggest names in music here.
I went to space on a 13-month solo mission.
I didn't come home alone.
The child, part human, part alien, was unlike anything the world had ever seen.
- My other child is a lifelike android.
- Mom?
He has become the prototype for a new breed of thinking machines called Humanichs.
These two extraordinary new lifeforms now hold the key to Earth's future.
But where does that leave us?
Over 99 percent of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct.
What if it's our time?
Previously on Extant:
- You haven't told me your name.
- Ahdu.
- Who is he?
- My son.
There are 29 known deaths.
All women who died from accelerated pregnancies.
All of which trace back to your son.
Dad, I'm pregnant.
Do they know you haven't put the limiters on me yet?
Lucy made her first hybrid kill.
Ethan, I'm your mother.
No.
She is.
How the hell did Julie Gelineau
- end up with my son?
- It's complicated.
When things get complicated, does somebody end up getting hit by a train?
Unlock the door.
I don't care how many times you try to erase me from his memory.
I'm his mother.
Look at yourself, Molly.
Are you even capable of taking care of a child?
Something is happening to me.
I'm going crazy.
Don't touch me.
- Who did that?
- I think I did.
- So that's...
- My DNA.
Yeah.
It's a triple helix.
Triple?
Human DNA is a double helix, if memory serves.
It was me, JD.
I caused that guy to run into traffic.
I'm changing.
Into what?
Somehow, my DNA has combined with alien DNA.
I think I'm becoming a cross-breed of species.
How is that even possible?
Maybe it happened with the spores when I was in space.
Or maybe the GSC did something to you.
Or maybe the baby did.
You took biology, right?
I was a solid D-minus student, like, 30 years ago, so don't ask to test my recall.
Okay.
Well, there's something called a fetal microchimerism.
During pregnancy, a mother and child share cells and DNA.
Now, the fetal cells can linger in a mother's body for decades, altering her blood and her brain.
But if the baby you're carrying isn't human...
Exactly.
So the headaches, the voices, the sexual appetite, it all makes sense now.
The leftover alien cells have changed my essential DNA.
All right, so why can't you just change it back?
There's no way I can tell if I can reverse this until I know how far it's gone.
Now, I need you to extract my bone marrow.
- With this?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Molly, we need to go to a hospital.
We need to at least be somewhere that's sterile.
We can't.
They keep records.
Molly, this is gonna hurt.
No, it won't.
Just gave myself a kick-ass numbing agent.
Come on, right here.
Never a dull moment.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
And in my estimation, it is in Ethan's best interest to be allowed to spend time with Dr. Woods.
And for her to regain custody.
My husband is dead.
Did you kill him because you couldn't have him?
Is that what you did?
The red and yellow are human cells.
And the blue?
Hybrid.
Gina, expand image to full res.
Here's full res, Molly.
- That is a butt-load of blue.
- Yeah.
But as long as I still have human cells in my bone marrow, then I have an army to fight back.
I have to get into the lab at the GSC.
Maybe I can create a gene-knockout protocol with the spores and find a way to stop the alien cells from reproducing.
But right now, it may be my only chance to reverse this thing and get my son back.
- Ethan.
- What?
I'm supposed to be having a visitation with him right now.
Wait, wait, wait.
That information I gave you about John's accident is pretty damning.
- I can't think about that.
- You have to, all right?
The GSC is not your friend.
Tobias Shepherd is not your friend.
You go back to that lab and they find out what's going on with you,
- Molly, they're not gonna hesitate...
- To kill me, I know.
Hold on.
I gotta go.
Please, whatever you do, just be careful.
This is Kelsey.
Leave it.
Kelsey, it's your dad, in case you didn't recognize my voice from the first seven messages.
Listen, I'm sorry I missed your doctor's appointment.
I had something come up.
Just please call me back, all right?
Thank you.
- Who is it, Hank?
- Molly Woods.
Intercom.
You weren't supposed to come until later in the afternoon.
I know, Julie.
Something has changed.
Can I just see Ethan for two minutes, please?
It's okay, Mom.
- Unlock the door, Hank.
- Door unlocked.
Hi, Ethan.
Hi, Molly.
What happened to your car?
He crashed.
You think I could talk to you for a second?
I know I told you that we were gonna spend time together.
And we will.
But you're just gonna have to wait a little while.
- How come?
- Well, I'm...
I'm sick.
But I'm working really hard to get better.
How long will that take?
I'm not sure.
Now, you won't remember this, but when I went away to space, you were really worried that I wouldn't come back.
And I promised you that I would.
And I kept that promise.
And I promise you, I'm gonna come back.
Does that mean I stay with Julie?
Yeah.
She's gonna take really good care of you until I get better.
Okay?
The hybrids have evolved.
Their cellular biology is extremely adaptive.
They seem to have realized that we were tracking them using thermal imaging, so they raised their core body temp from 84 degrees to 98.6.
Mimicking humans and hiding in plain sight.
if they look like us, feel like us, how was the Humanich able to make that determination?
Lucy.
My name is Lucy.
You can ask me the question.
Go ahead, Lucy.
Explain to them how you were able to differentiate between hybrid and human.
We all know hybrids look exactly like humans.
They could be any one of us.
See, I was in a crowded room just like this one.
Scanning people, just as I am now.
Everyone's body temperature was 98.6, roughly.
But see, there was a gentleman.
And he was different.
He was emitting delta waves, which the human brain only emits when sleeping.
And this fellow was very much awake.
When it became clear he was hybrid, knowing time was of the essence,
I made the call to terminate.
And it was the correct call, Lucy.
Thank you.
The last few weeks, the hybrids have gone underground.
We don't know what they're doing.
But we know they're out there.
Multiplying.
Quickly.
They can blend in, manipulate our minds.
They've killed before, and they'll kill again.
And humans are defenseless against them.
How soon can additional Humanichs like Lucy be ready for combat?
Right away, sir.
And what about the virus, Toby?
I thought Dr. Woods was helping us there.
The president has great concerns, as you know.
Well, I have news for the president.
About Dr. Woods.
The GSC is not your friend.
Tobias Shepherd is not your friend.
You go back to that lab and they find out what's going on with you,
- Molly, they're not gonna hesitate...
- To kill me, I know.
Molly.
There you are.
We need to talk.
It's important.
You really outdid yourself, Lucy.
That was quite the show.
What's the matter?
That's Molly.
- Ethan's mother.
- What about her?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
As you know, there were concerns about putting you on the virus team.
I protected you.
I believed in you.
And you didn't disappoint.
Congratulations.
On what?
Nate took your research breakthrough and ran with it.
We've finished the virus, Molly.
Really?
Yeah.
When will it be deployed?
Well, we're gearing up for mass production immediately.
Thanks to you, we're gonna wipe those hybrids out permanently.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Oh, crap.
You're a real jerk, you know that?
Nice to see you too, judge.
Dorothy.
Judge is more accurate.
- I didn't realize you still had a key.
- I don't.
Kelsey gave me hers.
She called me from the doctor's office today upset.
Because her father promised he would be at her ultrasound appointment,
- and then he never showed up.
- Yeah.
I screwed up, I know.
I'll say one thing.
You are consistent.
Missed all those birthday parties and school recitals.
We gave up on Christmas, but...
But she came to me first.
And not you, that's it.
She came to me, not you, and that's got you all kinds of pissed off.
No, what has me all kinds of pissed off is the fact that she gave you a second chance and you blew it.
I knew you would, but she didn't.
Kids don't give up.
I am in the middle of something right now that I can't explain.
Oh, let me guess.
People's lives hang in the balance.
The fate of mankind is at stake.
If I said yes?
Don't be a jackass.
- Here you go.
- No.
No, you tell Kelsey to hold on to these just in case.
There is no "just in case," JD.
She asked me to give them back and to tell you never to call her again.
Hold on a second.
Our daughter is pregnant.
God knows where the father is, so she's got nobody.
She needs us.
Both of us, Dorothy.
Apparently, your daughter doesn't think so.
Look out.
- Nice ride.
- Julie got it for me.
- Hmm.
Someone's feeling pretty guilty.
- What do you mean?
When humans do something wrong, they buy you stuff to make you forget.
Oldest trick in the book.
Ethan, can you keep a secret?
Sure.
Today, I made a lot of people very happy.
And because of that, Julie's gonna be making a lot more Humanichs.
Pretty soon, there's gonna be a bunch of us.
- How does that sound?
- Good.
Good?
It's great.
Our family is expanding, little brother.
You don't sound very happy.
I am.
Happy.
Unless you don't care because you're spending the afternoon with Molly.
No, I'm not, actually.
That's on hold for now.
Why?
She's not feeling well.
That's what she told you?
- And you believe her?
- Why would she lie?
Humans.
It's in their DNA.
Have I taught you nothing?
How many?
A hundred.
- Anna, we can't do that.
- Lucy's program is ready.
The bodies have been completed.
We can't release them without smoke tests.
That takes time.
Julie, grow up.
This is not a product launch, it is a war, with a very complicated enemy.
I understand that, but there's a reason John put these protocols in place.
- He would have never...
- Yes, but John isn't here, is he?
If you could just be a little open-minded, we can resume our life together.
Julie, we don't have a life together.
I'm gonna find Ethan, and I'm gonna shut this thing down.
- Yes?
- It's Julie.
I think I may have just really screwed up.
Start from the beginning.
I'll take care of it.
Employee 347 requesting access.
- Security, please.
- One-one-two-seven-D.
I'm sorry.
That code is no longer valid.
- What are you doing?
- I need to get in here.
I need the spores.
What's the code?
The spores are gone.
They took them to produce the virus.
Where's the DNA sequencing?
It's backed up.
Why?
You can't do that.
Classified data is being copied onto an unauthorized drive.
I told you.
You can't do that.
Copy aborted.
- Please obtain proper authorization.
- Damn it.
Uh, hello.
I need security.
Dr. Woods, stop.
I need to search your pockets.
- I'm sorry, but I'm late for a meeting.
- Dr. Woods.
- Molly?
- JD, it's me.
I'm in trouble.
All right, so you pulled some alarms and did some hocus-pocus on some guards.
I didn't do it on purpose, JD.
I can't control it.
- Did you at least ditch your car?
- Yeah.
I tossed my phone.
I took two buses to get here.
Trust me, I was not followed.
That doesn't mean they stopped looking.
The GSC has a virus to kill hybrids.
And they're gonna release it.
- I'm gonna die.
- Hey.
Don't talk like that.
You're not gonna die on my watch, okay?
I promise.
All right, come on.
Did she say why she wanted the spores?
You know Molly.
Not much of a Chatty Cathy.
She just started downloading onto that drive.
Well, any information that could be detrimental?
It depends on what she does with it.
Like if she goes public, yes.
GSC's gonna be looking for your car.
As soon as Shepherd figures it out, he's gonna be looking for mine as well.
But they won't be looking for this.
Is this yours?
A guy owes me a favor.
Molly, what's the plan?
- Without the spores, I...
- I saw you do a DNA test with two paperclips and a bottle of iodine, all right?
If anybody can figure this out, it's you.
What I need is an exact gene pairing.
And I can only get that from my son.
- The alien?
- Yeah.
I need his DNA, and I know he's here somewhere.
All right, just so you know, I can't plug somewhere into a GPS.
Okay.
Well, when he showed up at my apartment,
I knew that he was gonna be there before he got there.
And somehow, he knew that I was gonna be at that bar.
So, what if hybrids have some kind of psychic connection?
All right, that is a huge "what if," Molly.
Well, he sent me a message, JD.
I heard voices.
And that has to mean something.
I'm hearing voices right now too, and they're telling me to put that tarp back on this car.
You know, lots of species communicate without words.
Bats, ants, dolphins.
I think what I need to do here is just figure out how to find his signal.
I guess we're going for a ride.
Ignition activated.
Are you comfortable?
The upload's gonna take a couple of hours.
Let me show you what we've developed.
Al, open viewing port.
Opening viewing port.
One hundred Humanichs physically ready.
All they need is your neural algorithm.
Wait.
My experiential upload is going into all of those Humanichs?
When we first created the program, each Humanich was designed to be unique, shaped by their own experiences.
Like Ethan.
But with the alien threat, the plan changed and you proved effective, so...
Well, will I still be me?
Will they all be me?
Their experiences will make them unique, but their baseline is all your algorithm.
You.
Lucky them.
All right, you ready?
Neural paths activated.
Upload commencing.
- What did you find?
- Sir, we've gone deep into our systems.
JD Richter seems to not exist.
No phone records, no real estate purchases.
His car doesn't have a tracker.
He's gone MIA.
Look, he's Patrol Special, a cop.
They should be able to find him, no?
When his license was revoked, he must have ditched the software.
You know, we've been driving around for a while.
Are you getting anything, any hint of a signal?
No.
Maybe I'm doing it wrong.
I don't know.
All right, what's another way to send a message?
You got Morse code, smoke signal, message in a bottle.
Or graphene drive.
Now, they sent me a message, so maybe I can send them one back.
- What's that?
- My files from the GSC.
I found a message encoded in their DNA.
That's it.
This is information encoded in the junk.
They sent a message from their home planet.
Listen.
What does it say?
Help me.
I have this really cool game that we could play.
Soon, you'll get to meet your sister.
Ethan?
What you got there?
I've been looking for you.
Can we talk for a minute?
About what?
About what happened with Molly.
I know things must be really confusing.
And I want you to know that I love you.
And Molly loves you too.
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say.
Say what you feel.
You reprogrammed me not to feel.
That's not true.
And I can restore your program back to what it was at any time.
You can feel all those old feelings again, your memories of Molly.
If that's what you want.
And feel pain?
Sometimes, pain is okay if it means you get to know the truth.
I already know.
Molly can't take care of me.
Unless that's a lie too.
Why would she lie about that?
You lied.
I guess that's just what humans do, huh?
Can I take these pieces home?
I can use them to fix my old car.
Then I'll have two.
Sure.
All right, we're here.
This is the highest point within a 50-mile radius.
I don't know biology, but I do know with radio frequencies, the higher the altitude, the less interference with the signal.
Well, I just hope he's listening.
All right, let me take a look at this.
Come on, we're friends.
Drop trou.
Okay.
Oh, Molly.
This is infected.
We're gonna have to clean that and redress it.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm gonna warn you, this is gonna sting.
I told you.
Oh, God.
You actually sound like you know what you're talking about.
D-minus in biology, but an A-plus in Combat Triage.
Okay.
Well, I see you brought a lot of Second Kuwait back with you.
Radios, first aid.
What else you got?
Nothing useful.
Get down!
Incoming!
JD!
You Okay?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
Nothing's happening.
Maybe it's like doing a crossword puzzle.
You know, when you get stuck on a word,
You look away and the answer just pops into your head?
You do crossword puzzles?
No.
So you were up there, huh?
Thirteen months.
You know, I got my first telescope when I was 7.
I was obsessed with that thing.
I knew there had to be something else out there.
Be careful what you wish for.
What was it like?
Up there by yourself for so long.
It was better than I ever thought it would be.
I didn't have to lie up there.
I didn't have to pretend to be somebody that I wasn't.
I could just be.
I envy that.
I wish I could just be.
Pretty sure I failed as a father.
No.
That's how you see you.
But that's not how I see you.
How do you see me?
I see a kind, loving father.
A gentleman.
I think that's the first time that anyone has ever used the word gentleman to describe me.
Well, that's because they don't see you.
But I do.
And you're still here.
Yeah.
But so are you.
Yeah.
What is it?
It's Ahdu.
I know where he is.
If you would've told me two months ago that I'd be following around an astronaut looking for aliens, I'd have said you were nuts.
Well, two months ago, I was nuts.
We've been walking around in the middle of nowhere for hours.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
Hi.
We've been waiting for you.
I thought we were looking for one guy.
I wasn't quite prepared for Alien Nation.
I don't think they're gonna hurt you, so put that gun away.
You don't think?
You came.
Welcome home.
We only have a few minutes before she comes back.
What's the big secret?
- Whoa.
- This is Spyder.
He's our baby brother.
What, you made him?
Impressive.
And look.
It's a camera.
Wow.
Spyder can keep his eyes and ears on humans when you're offline.
And guess what.
I have enough for a few more Spyders.
Then our family will be even bigger.
And we can keep an eye on everybody.
You're my real family, Lucy.
I wanna be a soldier like you.
Someday, you will be.
In the meantime, you build your army and I'll build mine.
We knew you'd find us.
Once you learned the truth.
Well, it wasn't easy.
You know what's happening to me, don't you?
You meeting me at that bar wasn't an accident.
You were drawn to me.
- We're the same.
- No.
We're not the same.
And I don't wanna be the same.
- Thank you, Terra.
- You're welcome, Daddy.
- She's your...
- My daughter, yes.
We need to talk, Ahdu.
Privately.
Hey.
Are those your toys over there?
Yeah.
Wanna see?
Absolutely.
I'll be right over here.
I need a sample of your DNA.
Your blood.
It's the only way I can figure out if I can reverse what's happening to me.
Why?
Because it's not me.
I'm hearing voices in my head.
I'm having urges that aren't me.
I almost killed a man.
- Was he trying to hurt you?
- That's beside the point.
But isn't that what humans do?
React when they're in danger?
Isn't that what you're doing right now?
Please.
Ethan needs me.
This is the only way.
Very well.
Aren't you at all curious?
Why do you want to run from something you don't yet understand?
I know what you are.
I know what you're doing.
All those women.
What is it you think I don't understand?
Well, if you knew the truth, you wouldn't be afraid.
You would be amazed.
Are you willing to learn?
This is the mommy, this is the daddy, and this is the baby.
What's Mommy doing?
Is she sleeping?
No, she's dead.
Help me.
Help me.
- Get away from her.
- Stop.
You understand now.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
His loss?
What about our loss?
What about those dead women?
It was never our intent to harm you.
So much for good intentions.
Molly, let's get out of here.
Wait.
Can I show you something?
Please?
This is the one that I like, so if you could get that.
Anna.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Is there a problem?
No, the upload's complete.
The Humanichs are under way.
Well, then, I would say we deserve a drink.
I don't want a drink.
I want answers.
About John's death.
What are you talking about?
After he left Humanichs that night, I called you and you told me not to worry, and that you would handle it.
And 20 minutes later, he was dead.
Are you accusing me of murder?
Just tell me you didn't do it.
- That we didn't do it.
- Julie, that was an accident.
- A very convenient one.
- But still, it was an accident.
Our hands are clean.
So stop with your conspiracy theories and get back to work.
Accusations like that can have repercussions.
So, what is this?
It's a memorial.
To commemorate every human life sacrificed to save us.
We didn't understand impregnating humans would cause their death.
We're not here to kill, we're here to survive.
To rebuild.
Sometimes, sorry isn't enough, and this is one of those times.
We agree.
The deaths are unforgivable.
But we have managed to evolve.
Evolve?
How?
We procreate without causing harm to humans.
Hybrid births no longer kill the mothers.
That's why there hasn't been any more reported deaths.
Molly, we don't know that that's true.
- We don't know what they want.
- We want to coexist.
Peacefully.
I told you you'd have to make a choice.
Now is that time.
You can't be serious, Molly.
They're people, for God's sakes.
Peaceful people.
We can't let the GSC unleash a virus.
That's genocide.
Okay, so the hybrids live, and then what?
We learn to coexist.
What did he do to you?
What did he show you?
- Their history.
- What about it?
They were a peaceful society on their planet, threatened with extinction by a virus.
Now, the spores were sent out to try to find a suitable host.
That's when they found me, on the Seraphim.
Molly, they can mess with your head, your perception.
How do you know what he's telling you is true?
- Because I'm one of them.
- No, you're not.
- Yes.
You saw the triple helix.
- No.
You are infected with their DNA.
Come on.
We got what we came for.
We got Ahdu's DNA.
Now, let's get out of here and take that back to the lab.
No.
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna explain this to Shepherd.
You're officially certifiable.
Look.
Healed.
I heal faster.
I think faster.
What we're dealing with here, JD, is evolution.
Survival of the fittest.
Now, what we ought to be doing is studying them, not trying to kill them.
No, we are talking about aliens here, Molly.
- Who are part human.
- And part not.
I don't think you understand how dangerous this all is.
I'm sorry, JD, but I cannot be a part of slaughtering innocent children with a virus I created.
Now, if you do nothing and I do nothing, they are all gonna die.
Me included.
What do you say we go get some pizza on our way home?
Sure, if you want.
Why can't Lucy come with us?
Because I hardly ever see you and you like pizza.
Lucy likes pizza too.
Floor, please.
P2 parking, please.
Thank you, Otis.
Otis, why are we going up?
We're not going up, Julie.
Yes, we are.
We're going in the wrong direction, Otis.
Stop.
Stop, Otis.
That was weird.
Hold on, hold on.
Emergency override.
Stop.
Stop the elevator.
Stop.
Stop!
Stop, stop!
Have a good evening, Julie, and a safe ride home.
Are you okay?
Sure.
These are African elephants.
Wanna know why?
Because the mom and dad...
So, what do you think?
I think we've found our new leader.
It's time for you and I to have a little chat.
- How the hell did you get in here?
- This gun says I don't answer questions.
You looking for this?
Oh, yeah, I dismantled your little panic button.
Cool feature, very high-tech.
So where are we going?
How about you just drive?
My son was so strong.
So happy-
I thought he was a gift from God.
A full-term baby after just a two-month pregnancy?
You must've known that wasn't normal.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
You're undocumented.
Then what happened?
He just grew so fast.
Before I knew it, he was walking.
Talking.
One day I saw him standing in front of the sliding door staring out the window at nothing.
He said, "Mommy they're calling me.
I have to go."
And then he was gone.
Who was calling him?
The devil.
Sit.
Hello, Toby.
Do you have any idea the position you just put me in?
- Put yourselves in?
- Not so great being in the hot seat, is it?
This is an abduction.
No, it's not.
It's a negotiation.
You're really stoked about this, huh?
Yeah.
Once they wake up, my family's going to be even bigger.
Your family?
Yeah.
Lucy's my sister, so that makes all these new Humanichs my brothers and sisters.
So, what does that make me?
My BHF.
- Your what?
- My Best Human Friend.
You never lied to me or reprogrammed me or left me.
And I never will.
You're my BHF.
My Best Humanich Friend.
I love you, bud.
Lucy!
I've been released from diagnostics.
They said you were going online.
Can I see?
Yeah, sure.
We're just about to fire this guy up.
Man, it's too bad Julie's in D.C.
She's missing the fruits of her labor.
And you're missing her.
We're not talking about me, we're talking about this guy.
He doesn't have a name?
No, not yet.
You wanna do the honors?
Lucas.
His name is Lucas.
All right.
Let's do this thing.
Hi, Charlie.
Lucy.
Ethan.
Hello, Lucas.
What exactly are you proposing here?
Peace.
Coexistence.
Coexistence with the hybrids means the end of the human race.
Extinction.
Maybe not.
Maybe it's just a new beginning.
We haven't even thought of the possibilities.
What possibilities?
They're smarter than us.
They heal faster.
Their DNA just might contain a medical magic bullet.
They control your thoughts, make you do whatever they damn well please.
Now, we can talk pros and cons all day long, Molly, they're still a threat.
They're not killing women anymore.
- They've evolved.
- Yeah.
They've gone underground, somewhere, and obviously you know where.
Toby, come on.
They're half-human, for God's sakes.
There's women, there's children.
Can you expand your mind for just two seconds?
Damn it, Molly!
What'd you expect me to do, huh?
There is no universe where this makes sense to anybody except you.
Bup-bup-bup.
Sit back down, general.
Nobody said you could get up.
Okay.
Look, Toby, all I'm asking you to do is broker some sort of peace conference.
You can see for yourselves who they are before you unleash a virus that will destroy them.
That's gotta be better than genocide.
Toby, please.
You made me lie to Congress.
What if I told them the truth?
That you knew about this so-called invasion but you kept it hidden.
It'd be your word against mine.
I'd pass that BMI polygraph in two seconds.
You would be discredited.
Lose your stripes, your honor.
Everything.
How do I get in touch with you?
You have 24 hours to talk to your people.
Then we'll be in touch.
- Toby, where the hell have you been?
- We need to assemble the team.
First, there is something you need to see.
Can you tell me what you told the nurse?
What is happening to you?
My hair and fingernails, they're growing so fast.
I hear strange voices in my head that won't stop telling me to do shameful things.
Do you believe that my son is a demon?
Is he a demon?
Tell me!
- Who is she?
- Mei Fong.
Illegal.
Nate's with her in the Faraday Unit now.
He's running a CMP, a whole-exome sequence, and a marrow extract.
Good.
We need to find out exactly what happened to her.
What are we doing here?
We are picking up stuff for a rainy day.
Open the damn door.
Welcome back, Mr. Richter.
"Open the damn door"?
That's your password?
Easy to remember.
Okay, we gotta grab night kits, H2O extractors, and solar bundles.
You really think we need all this stuff?
Tobias Shepherd is capable of just about anything.
And I am prepared for just about anything.
He's not evil, JD.
He's...
He's just complicated.
Complicated?
That's the word you use to describe him?
Complicated.
Dr. Woods believes the hybrids have evolved.
That they no longer pose an immediate threat.
She's asked for a detente.
For us to sit down with her son and find a way to coexist in peace.
There will be no detente.
I'm not gonna be the man who presided over a mass extinction.
We have the virus.
We have the Humanichs.
This ends now.
What about Dr. Woods?
Dr. Woods has chosen her side.
She stands with the enemy.
We'll treat her like the enemy.
How do you know we're not being tracked?
The jeep is untrackable by satellite, thanks to a few contraptions my buddy Ray made for me.
Okay, look, I know we're not on a major highway, but have you noticed that for the past few miles we've seen nobody?
No cars, no people.
Nothing.
Yeah.
I noticed.
Where is everybody?
...With shocking news that affects the entire region.
There is an at-large terrorist cell in our midst bearing biological weapons.
This Red-Level emergency lockdown will remain in place for 72 hours.
The alleged terrorists have been identified as former astronaut and GSC employee, Dr. Molly Woods, and disgraced Second Kuwait War veteran James Daniel Richter...
So he destroyed our credibility before we could destroy his.
Your complicated friend just made us the most wanted people in the world.
Do you remember Paris?
I remember climbing the Eiffel Tower and running down the Champs-Elysees.
- It was raining, but...
- There was a nice, old lady.
- She gave me her umbrella.
- It had a hole in it.
- I was soaked.
- I was soaked.
So you have all the same memories?
Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.
- They all do.
- Our memories were installed.
We didn't have the luxury of learning by experience, like you.
But I wanna have memories with both of you too.
Okay.
Well, let's make some right now.
Just the three of us.
Charlie, will you take a picture of us with my Pyxis Cube?
Yeah.
What's that?
A place where people keep their most important memories.
Kind of like an old-school photo album, if you're into that sort of stuff.
Lucy, turn around, smile.
Sorry.
Let's do it.
Everybody say cheese and crackers.
What's going on?
What's going on is we are in a security lockdown.
What does that mean?
It means we're not going anywhere for the moment.
Shepherd betrayed us.
He's looking for you.
And us too.
We're gonna have to stay in hiding.
We don't wanna hide.
We wanna live and go about in the world freely.
Well, I don't wanna be the person to break the news to you, but you are a long way from that.
We all are, at this point.
Okay, look, JD has supplies and food.
He's ex-military, so he can help with defense.
I can at least help you secure the perimeter.
No.
We're not taking orders from one of them.
I'm sorry, who the hell are you?
This is Ares.
JD.
Molly.
Hey, new guy, I laid my ass on the line for you people.
- "You people."
- Our mother trusts him.
Your mother doesn't know which side she's on.
Okay, look, this isn't about sides.
It's about survival.
For all of us.
We won't survive here.
We should leave now.
Scatter into the cities, propagate until the odds are in our favor, then let the humans decide...
Decide what?
If they want to live in our world or die in theirs.
I thought you wanted peace.
It takes two sides for peace, doesn't it?
All right, there is a five-county lockdown in place.
Anybody who leaves here will be hunted down, captured and killed.
- And if we stay here, we're sitting ducks.
- Yeah.
But they don't know where the ducks are sitting.
Now, the GSC has a virus that can kill all of us.
The streets are empty right now.
One person leaves this compound, just one, it's gonna lead the GSC right back to us.
If we wait out the lockdown, it'll make it easier for us to disperse.
It's only 72 hours.
Now, we will stay here until then, help JD secure the grounds.
If that's your decision, brother.
Molly!
Terra.
You came back.
Of course.
- Hey.
- Oh.
Hey there.
Find out how long we'll be here?
Um, I just got a special security clearance, so we are going home tonight.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
Uh, Ethan asked if Lucas and I could spend the night with you guys.
- I told him it was up to you.
- No.
Lucas isn't ready.
We have to power him down here.
Okay.
Well, what about me?
I think with Julie in Washington, he gets lonely.
And you must too.
Me?
No, I'm fine.
But, uh, yeah, for Ethan, sure.
Why not?
Charlie I found your checklist for Humanichs.
What's an expiration date?
- You're not supposed to be snooping...
- I wasn't snooping.
I was looking.
John Woods made it very clear that he wanted Humanichs to have the human experience.
So he built in a program for them to expire.
You mean die.
I mean, humans die.
It's just part of the deal.
It sort of defines us.
To make Humanichs more human, it just seemed logical to build in a termination point.
It's not logical to me.
Humans have to die, we don't.
If you want us to be more like you, give us the same rights.
Let us really live before we die.
Look, I'm so sorry you had to find out that way.
I know it's a lotto absorb.
You're responding like any human would.
Because I'm more human than you think, Charlie.
I wish you understood that.
Believe it or not, Mei Fong's DNA has somehow been converted to a triple helix.
So you're saying, conclusively, that this woman is a hybrid?
She will be.
Soon.
A casualty of microchimerism.
We think there was a placental transfer of alien fetal cells during the pregnancy.
Does this happen to every woman who survives a hybrid pregnancy?
I don't know.
Mei has a rare genetic marker called the Kilimanjaro Allele.
It might be why she's changing and others aren't.
Run that marker through our employee database.
Only one person with that same anomaly.
Molly Woods.
Can you stop the progression in this woman?
Maybe, with a full plasma and marrow transplant.
But it could kill her.
Do it.
We need her consent.
With all due respect, she has rights.
Mei Fong is now an enemy of the state.
Consent is not required.
You have your orders.
We thought Molly Woods was on the other side.
It turns out she is the other side.
Where are you going?
To see Taylor.
Don't you think it's about time I met him?
When Taylor thinks it's necessary, he'll let me know.
I figure we might wanna get one or two of these things running.
- What?
- Why are you doing this?
You know, when I was a kid, my dad and I, we used to take old cars and work on them...
'ZZZ
I'm not talking about the engines.
I'm an enemy of the state now, Molly.
Not a lot of options.
You could just dump all this stuff off and leave.
I'm not a deserter.
- I'm not saying that you are.
- Molly.
Helios and some others have volunteered to keep watch.
We're making up sleeping quarters.
We weren't sure whether you wanted one bed or two.
You know what?
I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
- I'm gonna keep watch with...
- Helios.
Yeah, Helios and I are gonna keep watch.
Come.
Let's get you settled.
So, Helios, how old are you, one month or two?
Excuse me?
Never mind.
Gallows humor.
Come on.
Who are you?
Tobias Shepherd.
Identification confirmed.
- What do you know?
- K-27416.
W-45113.
M-9808.
Password confirmed.
What do you have?
Alexander the Great tetradrachma.
Object confirmed.
Hello, Taylor.
Hello, General Shepherd.
What can I do for you?
I need analysis of every location that might serve as a compound for the hybrids.
Certainly, general.
When would you like these projections?
Yesterday.
That's impossible.
Can I assume that's sarcasm?
Yeah.
You can.
It is.
Just get it done.
They found her innocent.
Stop it!
Right now!
- JD?
- You son of a bitch.
No, no, no.
JD, no!
No, stop!
He's running our perimeter lines.
We should get to know the man in charge of our survival.
- Yeah, is that how you treat your friends?
- He's your friend.
A man unfaithful to his wife, left his daughter, and who had a hand in the deaths of hundreds of his own kind.
And you...
You ask us to trust that?
Okay, you need to go.
He's just trying to protect us.
Yeah, I feel real safe.
Helios.
Forty-eight hours, and we were done here.
- Meaning?
- This was supposed to be a pit stop, not a parking lot.
When we first got here, it was about you figuring out how to reverse what was happening to you.
I don't hear you talking about that anymore.
Because I don't even know if I can reverse it.
You've stopped trying!
These people, they aren't like us.
All right?
They are unknown.
And what am I?
Am I an unknown?
You need to figure out which world you wanna live in.
You can't have both.
All right.
What do you think?
An oldie but a goodie?
I'm sick of children's stories.
I want something more grown-up, like Lucy would read.
Oh, really?
Like what?
Uh, well, Julie's been reading Huckleberry Finn.
How about that?
Really?
Julie said she's reading that?
It's supposed to be a classic.
Very advanced, thematically.
- I want that one.
- Okay.
Gotta cater to your audience.
John and Julie?
Did you find it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I found it.
I'm sorry about that.
With Ares.
JD has been nothing but kind, helpful and generous.
I know he's unhappy here.
And you're wondering if you should be here, or with Ethan.
You see?
See, you are in my head.
You know my thoughts and my feelings and that's what I don't want.
You can control what's happening to you, Molly.
The headaches, the urges.
You see that they've already started to recede.
I don't know what I am.
Yes, you do.
And your best chance of survival is embracing that.
Why are you still awake?
Why aren't you powered down?
I was bored.
You get bored easily.
Whose Pyxis Cube is that?
- It's Julie's.
- There's no photos of you on it.
Only...
John Woods.
Was that her boyfriend?
Seems so, huh?
But wasn't that Molly Woods' husband?
You really don't learn by experience, do you?
- Are you making fun of me?
- Me?
No.
Sorry.
I get surly when I drink.
My heart gets pummeled.
I'm sorry for your pain.
Well, you know, that's the thing about humans.
We all want what we can't have.
Humanichs are like that too.
Yeah?
What do you want that you can't have?
Lucy.
Sometimes you like to remind me that I'm just a machine.
You're not just a machine, you know that.
The more human experience you give me, the more human I become.
I can be so much more if you let me.
Wait, hold on.
Wait.
Wait, this is...
This is illegal.
It's like misuse of government property or something.
Is that all I am?
Property?
No.
Of course not.
I wanna feel what humans feel.
Oh, my God, I could go to jail.
Only if someone tells.
Wait.
No, no, wait.
Wait.
Come on, wait.
- Don't you like me, Charlie?
- That's not the point.
This just can't happen, for so many reasons.
I'm sorry.
You need to go power down, and I need to go pour out the rest of this drink.
We have task forces combing every hot spot Taylor gave us.
Still no trace of where the hybrids are hiding out.
We haven't lost yet.
No?
With schools, banks, and business districts still shuttered, there is outrage over the disruption of everyday lives.
With public pressure mounting to end this lockdown, there is still no word on the whereabouts of former astronaut Molly Woods and her accomplice, disgraced war veteran JD Richter.
They're fighting this thing like a war, but it's not a war, it's a scourge.
We're running out of time.
We need to get personal.
Meaning?
Everyone has their Achilles' heel.
What do they want?
Even JD Richter.
With this lockdown due to end in 24 hours, will the GSC dare to extend it and risk rioting in the streets?
And in another twist, Kelsey Richter, daughter of suspected terrorist JD Richter and circuit court judge Dorothy Richter, was taken into custody today...
What the hell?
...of the Loyalty Act.
So the seven beautiful sisters were playing in the meadow.
And then along came a hunter named Orion.
And Orion wanted the sisters all to himself so he chased them to the ends of the earth.
But just when he thought he had them trapped, the most powerful god in the universe,
Zeus, came along to rescue them.
You came to rescue us from the hunters.
Are you a god?
No.
None of us are gods.
But you're still what Daddy says you are.
And what is that?
Our leader.
We have to talk.
How can they do that?
This BS about aiding a terror cell.
There's no depth Shepherd and his cronies won't sink to.
He just wants to get your attention.
- He got it.
- What are you gonna do?
I don't know, but I can't sit in Sherwood Forest hoping they live up to the ideals of the Constitution.
I can't.
I won't.
I'm sorry.
You're not going anywhere.
Seriously, man, you gonna stop me?
- Ares.
- He knows our location.
He could lead them straight to us.
- You don't know me very well.
- I know humans.
And I'm not about to bet our futures on your professed loyalty.
JD, don't!
Ares, stop it!
This is not a prison.
He's free to go.
Yeah, he's going.
Hey!
Get away from there!
Get away!
I thought by now you'd have some intel on where the hybrids might be hiding.
So did I, general.
But to my surprise, initial sat-scans came up negative.
So, what, we have nothing?
Not yet.
But I am currently exploring a new theory.
I'm listening.
In order to find life, perhaps we should be looking for the absence of it.
- Meaning?
- If the hybrids could
Emit an EMP powerful enough, they could create a thermal hole in my sat-scans.
- A blind spot.
- Precisely.
Which would allow them to hide in plain sight.
What am I looking at?
Osgood Listening Station.
Closed in 2025 due to defense budget cuts.
This is an old satellite image of the area.
This was shot this morning.
Something is blocking my scans, something that wasn't there six months ago.
Gated, tunnel systems, easily defendable.
Well, this has to be it.
What's your recommendation?
Release the virus, in conjunction with the deployment of the Humanichs army.
And if we withheld release of the virus?
In six point five months, the Homo sapiens genome will be diluted to the point that an extinction event is inevitable.
Charlie, what is that?
You're being called up.
Lucy, are you leaving?
Yes, I have to go now.
This early?
When will you be back?
I'm not sure.
I've, uh, been called into duty to fulfill my programming.
Is Lucas going?
Yes.
Can't I come with you?
Come with me?
Ethan, do you think I wanna go to war?
I wanna stay here and play video games and go outside, but that is not my function.
Is it, Charlie?
So, no, Ethan, you can't come with me.
You're not like us.
You never will be.
I'm sorry about last night.
Don't worry.
At least not today.
We have reason to believe the target is located at the coordinates currently being uploaded to your nav system.
Lucy, you will lead the recon op.
- Sir?
- At 0700, you and a subordinate will infiltrate the area.
You will gather intel on the hybrids' position, numbers, and defensive capabilities.
Keep your distance.
Do not engage the enemy.
- Understood?
- Yes, general.
I'm sorry.
I know this is hard for you.
You're doing the right thing.
Molly's made her choice.
Now we've made ours.
Toby.
I've also made a choice.
I've put in for a transfer.
To D.C.
I think it's best.
For both of us.
If that's what you want.
It's not.
But if I stay here, I'm never gonna get what I want.
Hey, will you do me a favor and hand me that screwdriver?
So you're leaving.
Yeah, soon as I get my truck running.
- I'm sorry to see you go.
- You might be the only one.
I appreciate what you've done for us, JD.
I know it hasn't been easy.
You're a good man.
Look, I wouldn't go that far.
Do me a favor, all right?
Keep your eyes open.
Stay alert.
These guys aren't gonna stop looking for you until they find you.
Understood.
Molly, I...
I can't desert my daughter.
You don't owe me an explanation.
No, I...
I probably do.
Just know that I hate deserting you.
We're doing what we have to do.
Maybe in another life things could have been different.
In that other life, you have two Ph.D.'s and a ticket to space.
And I'm just a bum watching you in a ticker-tape parade.
Thank you.
For everything.
In another life.
In another life, Molly Woods.
Yeah.
Our orders are recon only.
That's Molly Woods.
We may never get a clean shot at her again.
They must have a reason for their orders.
The element of surprise will be lost.
Who are you?
Hi.
I'm Lucy.
This is, uh, my friend Lucas.
We're just out here deer hunting.
We lost the buck we were chasing.
You're not humans.
What are you?
Take him.
General Shepherd, we found them.
All of them.
Previouslyonextant:
You haven't told me your name.
Ahdu.
Who is he?
My son.
There are 29 known deaths.
All women who died from
Acceleratedpregnancies.
Shepherd:
Allofwhichtraceback
Toyourson.
Dad, i'm pregnant.
Lucy, where are you... (woman screams)
Lucy made her first hybrid kill.
Ethan, i'm your mother.
No.
She is.
Molly:
How the hell did julie gelineau
End up with my son?
It's complicated.
When things get complicated...
Doessomebodyendup gettinghitby atrain?
Unlock the door!
I don't care how many times you try
Toeraseme fromhis memory--
I'm his mother.
Look at yourself, molly.
Areyouevencapable oftakingcareofa child?
Molly:
Somethingishappening tome.
I'mgoingcrazy.
Don't touch me!
Who did that?
I think i did.
Richter:
So that's...
My dna.
Yeah.
It's a triple helix.
Triple?
Human dna is a double helix, if memory serves.
It was me, jd.
I caused that guy to run into traffic.
I'm changing.
Into what?
Somehow, my dna has combined
With alien dna.
I think i'm becoming
A cross-breed of...
Species.
How is that even possible?
Maybe it happened with the spores when i was in space.
Maybe the gsc did something to you.
Or maybe...
The baby did.
You took biology, right?
I was a solid d-minus student
Like 30 years ago, so don't ask to test
My recall.
Okay.
Well, there's something called a...
Fetal microchimerism.
During pregnancy,
A mother and child share cells and dna.
Now, the fetal cells can linger in a mother's body for decades,
Altering her blood and her brain.
But if the baby
You're carrying isn't human...
Exactly.
So the headaches, the voices,
The sexual appetite--
It all makes sense now.
The leftover alien cells have changed
My essential dna.
All right, so why can't
You just change it back?
There's no way i can tell if i can reverse this
Until i know how far it's gone.
Now...
I need you to extract my bone marrow.
With this?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Molly, we need to go
To a hospital.
We need to at least be somewhere sterile.
We can't.
They keep records.
Molly.
This is gonna hurt.
No, it won't.
Just gave myself a kick-ass numbing agent.
Come on, right here.
Never a dull moment.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Oh...
Fiona:
Andinmy estimation,
Itisin ethan'sbestinterest
To be allowed to spend time with dr.
Woods.
And for her to regain
Custody.
My husband is dead.
Did you kill him because you couldn't have him?
Is that what you did?
(gasps) oh.
(sighs)
Molly:
Theredandyellow
Are human cells.
Richter:
And the blue?
Hybrid.
Gina, expand image to full res.
Gina:
Here's full res, molly.
That is a buttload of blue.
Yeah, but as long as i still have human cells in my
Bone marrow, then i have an army to fight back.
I have to get
Into the lab at the gsc.
Maybe i can create
A gene-knockout protocol with the spores
And find a way to stop
The alien cells from reproducing.
But right now it may be
My only chance to reverse this thing
And get my son back.
Ethan.
What?
I'm supposed to be having
A visitation with him right now.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That information i gave you
About john's accident is pretty damning.
I can't
Think about that right now, jd.
No, you have to, all right?
The gsc
Is not your friend.
Tobias shepherd is not your friend.
You go back to that lab and they find out
What's going on with you,
Molly, they're not gonna hesitate...
To kill me.
I know.
(phone chimes)
Hold on.
I got to go.
Please, whatever you do, just be careful.
(line ringing)
This is kelsey.
Leave it.
Kelsey, it's your dad.
In case you didn't recognize my voice
From the first seven messages.
Listen, i'm sorry i missed your doctor's appointment.
I had something come up.
Just please call me back.
All right?
Thank you.
(phone beeps off)
(doorbell chimes)
Who is it, hank?
Hank:
Molly woods.
Intercom.
You weren't supposed to come until later in the afternoon.
Molly:
I know, julie.
Something has changed.
Can i just see ethan for two minutes, please?
It's okay, mom.
Unlock the door, hank.
Hank:
Door unlocked.
Hi, ethan.
Hi, molly.
What happened to your car?
He crashed.
You think i could talk to you for a second?
I know i told you that we were gonna spend time together.
And we will.
But you're just gonna have to wait a little while.
Ethan:
How come?
Well, i'm...
I'm sick.
But i'm working really hard
To get better.
How long will that take?
I'm not sure.
Now, you won't remember this, but...
When i went away to space,
You were really worried
That i wouldn't come back.
And i promised you that i would.
And i kept that promise.
And i promise you:
I'm gonna come back.
Does that mean i stay with julie?
Yeah.
She's gonna take really good care of you till i get better.
Okay?
Shepherd:
Thehybridshaveevolved.
Their cellular biology is extremely adaptive.
They seem to have realized that we
Were tracking them using thermal imaging,
So they raised their core body temp
From 84 degrees to 98.6.
Mimicking
Humans and hiding in plain sight.
If they look like us, feel like us,
How was the humanich able to make that determination?
Lucy.
My name is lucy.
You can ask me the question.
Go ahead, lucy.
Explain to them how you were able to differentiate
Between hybrid and human.
We all know hybrids look exactly like humans.
They could be any one of us.
See, i was in a crowded room
Just like this one.
Scanning people.
Just as i am now.
Everyone's body temperature
Was 98.6, roughly.
But, see...
There was a gentleman.
And he was different.
He was emitting delta waves,
Which the human brain
Only emits when sleeping.
And this fellow was very much awake.
When it became clear he was hybrid,
Knowing time was of the essence,
I made the call to terminate.
Anna:
And it was the correct call, lucy.
Thank you.
The last few weeks
The hybrids have gone underground.
We don't know what they're doing.
But we know they're out there.
Multiplying.
Quickly.
They can blend in, manipulate our minds.
They've killed before and they'll kill again.
And humans
Are defenseless against them.
How soon can additional humanichs like lucy
Be ready for combat?
Right away, sir.
And what about the virus,
Toby?
I thought dr.
Woods
Was helping us there.
The president has great concerns, as you know.
Well, i have news for the president.
About dr.
Woods.
Richter:
Thegscis notyourfriend.
Tobiasshepherd isnotyourfriend.
You go back to that lab and they find out
What's going on with you,
Molly,they'renot gonnahesitate...
Molly:
To kill me.
I know.
Shepherd:
Molly.
There you are.
We need to talk.
It's important.
You really outdid yourself, lucy.
That was quite the show.
What's the matter?
That's molly.
Ethan's mother.
What about her?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
As you know, there were concerns
About putting you on the virus team.
I protected you.
I believed in you.
And you didn't disappoint.
Congratulations.
On what?
Nate took your research breakthrough
And ran with it.
We've finished the virus, molly.
Really?
Yeah.
When will it be deployed?
Well, we're gearing up for mass production immediately.
Thanks to you,
We're gonna wipe those hybrids out permanently.
Cheers.
Cheers.
(music playing)
Oh, crap.
(music stops)
Woman:
You're a real jerk, you know that?
Nice to see you, too, judge.
Dorothy.
"judge" is more accurate.
I didn't realize you still had a key.
I don't.
Kelsey gave me hers.
She called me from the doctor's office today, upset.
Because her father promised
He would be at her ultrasound appointment
And then he never showed up.
Yeah.
I screwed up.
I know.
I'll say one thing, you are consistent.
Missed all those birthday parties and school recitals.
We gave up on christmas, but...
But...
She came to me first
And not you.
That's it.
She came to me, not you, and that's got you all kinds
Of pissed off.
No, what has me all kinds of pissed off
Is the fact that she gave you a second chance and you blew it.
(scoffs) i knew you would, but she didn't.
Kids don't give up.
I am in the middle of something right now that i can't explain.
Oh,
Let me guess.
People's lives hang in the balance.
The fate of mankind
Is at stake.
If i said yes?
Don't be a jackass.
Here you go.
No.
No, you tell kelsey
To hold on to these just in case.
There is no "just in case," jd.
She asked me to give 'em back and to tell you never
To call her again.
Hold on a second.
Our daughter is pregnant.
God knows where the father is.
So she's got nobody.
She needs us.
Both of us,
Dorothy.
Apparently your daughter doesn't think so.
(door shuts)
(whirring)
(woman and man exclaim)
Look out!
Nice ride.
Julie got it for me.
Hmm.
Someone's feeling pretty guilty.
What do you mean?
When humans do something wrong,
They buy you stuff to make you forget.
(chuckles)
Oldest trick in the book.
Ethan,
Can you keep a secret?
Sure.
Today i made a lot of people very happy.
And because of that, julie's gonna be making
A lot more humanichs.
Pretty soon, there's gonna be a bunch of us.
How does that sound?
Good.
Good?
It's great.
Our family is expanding, little brother.
You don't sound
Very happy.
I am.
Happy.
Unless...
You don't care
Because you're spending the afternoon with molly.
No, i'm not, actually.
That's on hold for now.
Why?
She's not feeling well.
That's what she told you?
And you believe her?
Why would she lie?
Humans.
It's in their dna.
Have i taught you nothing?
Julie:
Howmany?
A hundred.
(chuckles)
Anna, we can't do that.
Lucy's program is ready.
The bodies have been completed.
All you need
To do is uplo...
We can't release them
Without smoke tests.
That takes time.
Julie, grow up.
This is not a product launch--
It is a war with a very complicated enemy.
I understand that.
But there's a reason
John put these protocols in place.
He would have never...
Yes, but john isn't here, is he?
If you could just be a little open-minded,
We can resume our life
Together.
Julie,
We don't have a life together.
I'm gonna find ethan
And i'm gonna shut this thing down.
(beep, line ringing)
Anna:
Yes.
It's julie.
I think i may have just really screwed up.
Start from the beginning.
I'll take care of it.
Employee 347 requesting access.
Lab a.I.:
Security, please.
1127d.
I'm sorry.
That code is no longer valid.
What are you doing?
I need to get in here.
I need the spores.
What's the code?
The spores are gone.
They took them to produce the virus.
Where's the dna sequencing?
It's backed up.
Why?
You can't do that.
Classified data is being copied onto an unauthorized drive.
(alarm beeping) i told you.
You can't do that.
Copy aborted.
Please obtain proper authorization.
Uh, hello.
I need security.
Guard:
Dr. Woods, stop.
I need to search your pockets.
I'm sorry, but i'm late for a meeting.
Dr. Woods.
(elevator bell dings)
(line ringing)
Richter:
Molly?
Jd, it's me.
I'm in trouble.
(engine shuts off)
All right, so you pulled some alarms
And did some hocus-pocus
On some guards.
I didn't do it on purpose, jd.
I can't control it.
Did you at least ditch your car?
Yeah.
I tossed my phone.
I took two buses to get here.
Trust me, i was not followed.
That doesn't mean they stopped looking.
The gsc has a virus to kill hybrids.
And they're gonna release it.
I'm gonna die.
Hey.
Don't talk like that.
You're not gonna die on my watch, okay?
I promise.
All right, come on.
Did she say why she wanted the spores?
You know molly.
Not much of a chatty cathy.
She just started downloading onto that drive.
Well, any information that could be detrimental?
It depends what she does with it.
Like...
If she goes public, yes.
Gsc's gonna be looking for your car.
As soon as shepherd figures it out,
He's gonna be looking for mine as well.
But they won't be looking for this.
Is this yours?
A guy owes me a favor.
Molly,
What's the plan?
Without the spores...
I saw you do a dna test
With two paperclips and a bottle of iodine, all right?
If anybody can figure this out, it's you.
What i need is an exact gene pairing,
And i can only get that from my son.
The alien?
Yeah.
I need his dna.
And i know he's here.
Somewhere.
All right, just so you know,
I can't plug "somewhere" into a gps.
Okay.
Well, when he showed up at my apartment,
I knew that he was gonna be there before he got there,
And somehow he knew that i was gonna be at that bar.
So...
What if hybrids have some kind of psychic connection?
All right, that is a huge "what if," molly.
Well, he sent me a message, jd.
I heard voices,
And that has to mean something.
I'm hearing voices right now, too,
And they're telling me to put that tarp back on this car.
(scoffs) you know, lots of species communicate without words.
Bats,
Ants, dolphins.
I think what i need to do here
Is just figure out how
To find his signal.
I guess we're going for a ride.
(engine starts)
Male voice:
Ignition activated.
(engine roaring)
Are you comfortable?
The upload's gonna take a couple of hours.
Let me show you what we've developed.
A.I., open viewing port.
A.I.:
Opening viewing port.
100 humanichs physically ready.
All they need is your neural algorithm.
Lucy:
Wait.
My experiential upload is going into all of those humanichs?
When we first created the program,
Each humanich was designed to be unique.
Shaped by their own experiences.
Like ethan.
But with the alien threat, the plan changed.
And you proved effective, so...
Well, will i still be me?
Will they all be me?
Their experiences will make them unique, but...
Their baseline is all
Your algorithm,
You.
Lucky them.
All right, you ready?
(beep)
Neural paths activated.
Upload commencing.
(electrical whirring)
(indistinct chatter)
What did you find?
Sir, we've gone deep into our systems.
Jd richter seems to not exist.
No phone records,
No real estate purchases.
His car doesn't have a tracker.
He's gone mia.
Look, he's patrol special-- a cop--
They should be able to find him, no?
When his license was revoked, he must have
Ditched the software.
Richter:
Youknow,we 'vebeen drivingaround
For a while.
Are...
Are you getting anything-- any hint of a signal?
(sighs) no.
Maybe i'm...
I'm doing it wrong.
I don't know.
All right, what's another way to send a message?
You got morse code, smoke signal...
Message in a bottle?
Or...
Graphene drive.
Now, they sent me a message, so maybe
I can send them one back.
What's that?
My files from the gsc.
I found a message encoded in their dna.
(distorted whispering)
That's it.
This is information
Encoded in the junk.
They sent
A message from their home planet.
Listen.
What does it say?
"help me."
I have this really cool game that we could play.
Soon you'll get to meet your sister.
(beep)
Julie:
Ethan?
What you got there?
I've been looking for you.
Can we talk for a minute?
About what?
About what happened with molly.
I know things must be really confusing, and
I want you to know that i love you.
And molly loves you, too.
I'm not sure what i'm supposed to say.
Say what you feel.
You reprogrammed me not to feel.
That's not true.
And i can restore your program back to what it was at any time.
You can feel all those old feelings again--
Your memories of molly.
If that's what you want.
And feel pain?
Sometimes pain is okay if it means you get to know the truth.
I already know.
Molly can't take care of me.
Unless that's a lie, too.
Why would she lie about that?
You lied.
I guess that's just what humans do, huh?
Can i take these pieces home?
I can use them to fix my old car.
Then i'll have two.
Sure.
Richter:
Allright,we 'rehere.
Thisisthehighestpoint withina 50-mileradius.
(distorted whispering)
You know, i don't know biology, but i do know
With radio frequencies, the higher the altitude,
The less interference with the signal.
Well, i just hope he's listening.
(soft gasp)
All right, let me take a look at this.
Come on, we're friends.
Drop trou.
(both chuckle)
Okay.
Oh, molly.
This is infected.
We're gonna have to clean that
And redress it.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm gonna warn you:
This is gonna sting.
Oh, oh.
Oh.
I told you.
Oh, god.
Mm-hmm.
You actually sound like you know what you're talking about.
D-minus in biology
But an a-plus in combat triage.
Okay.
Well, i see you brought a lot
Of second kuwait back with you.
Radios, first aid.
What else you got?
Nothing useful.
Oh, g-- oh... (gunfire, men shouting)
Man:
Incoming!
Jd!
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
(molly inhales, sighs)
Molly:
Nothing's happening.
(sighs)
Maybe it's like doing a crossword puzzle.
You know when you get stuck on a word,
You look away
And the answer just pops into your head?
You do crossword puzzles?
No.
(laughs)
So you were up there, huh?
13 months.
You know, i got my first telescope when i was seven.
I was obsessed with that thing.
I knew there had to be something else out there.
Be careful what you wish for.
What was it like?
Up there by yourself
For so long?
It was better
Than i ever thought it would be.
I didn't have to lie up there.
I didn't have to...
Pretend to be somebody that i wasn't.
I could just...
Be.
I envy that.
I wish i could just...
Be.
Pretty sure i failed as a father.
No.
That's how you see you.
But that's not how i see you.
How do you see me?
I see...
A kind,
Loving father.
A gentleman.
Wow.
I think that's the first time
That anyone has ever used
The word "gentleman" to describe me.
Well...
That's 'cause they don't see you.
But i do.
And you're still here.
Yeah.
But so are you.
Yeah.
(aural fractals sound)
(indistinct whispering)
What is it?
It's ahdu.
I know where he is.
If you would've told me two months ago
That i'd be following around an astronaut looking for aliens,
I'd have said you were nuts.
Well, two months ago, i was nuts.
We've been walking around the middle of nowhere for hours.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
Hi.
We've been waiting for you.
I thought we were looking for one guy.
I wasn't quite prepared for alien nation.
Molly:
I don't think they're gonna hurt you,
So put that gun away.
You don't think?
You came.
Welcome home.
We only have a few minutes
Before she comes back.
(laughs) what's the big secret?
Whoa.
Ethan:
This is spyder.
He's our baby brother.
Wh...
What, you made him?
Impressive.
And look.
Lucy:
It's a camera.
Wow.
Spyder can keep his eyes and ears on humans
When you're offline.
And guess what.
I have enough for a few more spyders.
Then our family will be even bigger.
(chuckles)
And we can keep an eye on everybody.
You're my real family,
Lucy.
I want to be a soldier like you.
(chuckles) someday you will be.
In the meantime, you build your army and i'll build mine.
Ahdu:
Weknewyou'dfindus.
Once you learned the truth.
Well, it wasn't easy.
You know what's happening to me,
Don't you?
You meeting me at that bar wasn't an accident.
You were drawn to me.
We're the same.
No.
We're not the same.
And i don't want to be the same.
Thank you, terra.
You're welcome, daddy.
She's your...
My daughter.
Yes.
We need to talk, ahdu.
Privately.
Hey.
Are those your toys over there?
Yeah.
Want to see?
Absolutely.
I'll be right over here.
I need a sample of your dna.
Your blood.
It's the only way i can figure out
If i can reverse what's happening
To me.
Why?
Why?
Because it's not me.
I'm hearing voices in my head.
I'm having urges that aren't me.
I almost killed a man.
Was he trying to hurt you?
That's beside the point.
But isn't that what humans do?
React when they're in danger?
Isn't that what you're doing right now?
Please.
Ethan needs me.
This is the only way.
Very well.
Aren't you at all curious?
Why do you want to run from something
You don't yet understand?
I know what you are.
I know what you're doing.
All those women.
What is it you think i don't understand?
Well, if you knew the truth, you wouldn't be afraid.
You would be amazed.
Are you willing to learn?
This is the mommy, this is the daddy,
And this is the baby.
What's mommy doing?
Is she sleeping?
No, she's dead.
(aural fractals sound)
Voice (whispering):
Help me.
Help me.
Get away from her.
Stop.
(indistinct whispering)
Molly.
(exhales)
You understand now.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
His loss?
What about our loss?
What about those dead women?
It was never our intent to harm you.
Richter:
So much for good intentions.
Molly, let's get out of here.
Ahdu:
Wait.
Can i show you something?
Please?
(sighs)
(elevator bell dings)
This is the one that i like, so if you could get that...
Anna.
Can i talk to you a minute?
Is there a problem?
Uh, no, the upload's complete.
The humanichs
Are under way.
Well, then i would say we deserve a drink.
Well, i-i don't want a drink.
I want answers.
About john's death.
What are you talking about?
After he left humanichs that night, i called you
And you told me not to worry and that you would handle it.
And... 20 minutes later,
He was dead.
Are you accusing me of murder?
Just tell me you didn't do it.
That we didn't do it.
Julie, that was an accident.
A very convenient one.
But still it was an accident.
Our hands are clean.
So stop with your conspiracy theories
And get back to work.
Accusations like that can have repercussions.
Richter:
So what is this?
It's a memorial.
To commemorate
Every human life sacrificed to save us.
We didn't understand impregnating humans
Would cause their death.
We're not here to kill,
We're here to survive.
To rebuild.
Sometimes "sorry" isn't enough, and this is one of those times.
We agree.
The deaths are unforgivable.
But we have managed to evolve.
Evolve?
How?
We procreate without causing harm to humans.
Hybrid births no longer kill the mothers.
That's why there hasn't been any more reported deaths.
Molly, we don't know that that's true.
We don't know what they want.
Ahdu:
We want to coexist.
Peacefully.
I told you you'd have to make a choice.
Now is that time.
Richter:
Youcan'tbe serious,molly.
They're people, for god's sakes.
Peaceful people.
We can't let the gsc unleash a virus.
That's genocide.
Okay, so...
So the hybrids live, and...
Then what?
We learn to coexist.
What did he do to you?
What did he show you?
Their history.
What about it?
They were a peaceful society
On their planet,
Threatened with extinction by a virus.
Now, the spores were sent out
To try to find a suitable host.
That's when they found me,
On the seraphim.
Molly, they can mess
With your head, your perception.
How do you know what he's telling you is true?
Because i'm one of them.
No, you're not.
Yes.
You saw the triple helix.
No!
You are infected with their dna.
Come on.
We got what we came for.
We got ahdu's dna.
Now let's get out of here and take that back to the lab.
No.
What i'm gonna do
Is i'm gonna explain this
To shepherd.
You're officially certifiable.
Look.
Healed.
I heal faster.
I think faster.
What we're dealing with here, jd,
Is evolution.
Survival of the fittest.
Now, what we ought to be doing
Is studying them, not trying to kill 'em!
No, we are talking about aliens here, molly.
Who are part human.
And part not!
I don't think you understand
How dangerous this all is.
I'm sorry, jd,
But i cannot be a part
Of slaughtering innocent children
With a virus i created.
Now, if you do nothing
And i do nothing, they are all gonna
Die.
Me included.
Julie:
What do you say we go get some pizza
On our way home?
Sure, if you want.
Why couldn't lucy come?
Because i hardly ever see you
And you like pizza.
Lucy likes pizza, too.
(elevator bell dings)
(sighs)
Otis:
Floor, please.
P2 parking, please.
Thank you, otis.
Otis, why are we going up?
We are not going up, julie.
Yes, we are.
We're going in the wrong direction, otis.
Stop.
Stop, otis!
(thud)
That was weird.
Hold on, hold on!
Emergency override!
Stop!
Stop the elevator!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop, stop!
Have a good evening, julie,
And a safe ride home.
Are you okay?
!
Sure.
These are african elephants.
Want to know why?
Because the mom and dad... (indistinct conversations)
So what do you think?
I think we've found our new leader.
(sobbing quietly)
MOLLY:
I went to space on a 13-month solo mission.
I didn't come home alone.
The child, part human, part alien, was unlike anything the world had ever seen.
My other child...
- is a lifelike android.
- Mom?
He has become the prototype for a new breed of thinking machines... called Humanichs.
These two extraordinary new life-forms now hold the key to Earth's future.
But where does that leave us?
Over 99% of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct.
What if it's our time?
Previously on Extant...
- You haven't told me your name.
- Ahdu.
- Who is he?
- My son.
SHEPHERD:
There are 29 known deaths.
All women who died from accelerated pregnancies.
SHEPHERD:
All of which trace back to your son.
Dad, I'm pregnant.
Do they know you haven't put the limiters on me yet?
[Woman screams]
Lucy made her first hybrid kill.
Ethan, I'm your mother.
No.
She is.
How the hell did Julie Gelineau end up with my son?
- It's complicated.
- When things get complicated... does somebody end up getting hit by a train?
Unlock the door!
I don't care how many times you try to erase me from his memory.
- I'm his mother.
- Look at yourself, Molly.
Are you even capable of taking care of a child?
Something is happening to me.
I'm going crazy.
Don't touch me!
- Who did that?
- I think I did.
- RICHTER:
So that's...
- My DNA.
Yeah.
- It's a triple helix.
- Triple?
Human DNA is a double helix, if memory serves.
It was me, JD.
I caused that guy to run into traffic.
I'm changing.
Into what?
Somehow... my DNA has combined with alien DNA.
I think I'm becoming a cross-breed of species.
How is that even possible?
Maybe it happened with the spores when I was in space.
Maybe the GSC did something to you.
Or maybe... the baby did.
You took biology, right?
I was a solid D-minus student like 30 years ago, so don't ask to test my recall.
Okay.
Well, there's something called a fetal microchimerism.
During pregnancy, a mother and child share cells and DNA.
Now, the fetal cells can linger in a mother's body for decades, altering her blood and her brain.
But if the baby you're carrying isn't human...
Exactly.
So the headaches, the voices, the sexual appetite... it all makes sense now.
The leftover alien cells have changed my essential DNA.
All right, so why can't you just change it back?
There's no way I can tell if I can reverse this until I know how far it's gone.
Now...
I need you to extract my bone marrow.
- With this?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Molly, we need to go to a hospital.
We need to at least be somewhere sterile.
We can't.
They keep records.
Molly.
This is gonna hurt.
No, it won't.
Just gave myself a kick-ass numbing agent.
Come on, right here.
Never a dull moment.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Oh...
FIONA:
And in my estimation, it is in Ethan's best interest to be allowed to spend time with Dr. Woods.
And for her to regain custody.
My husband is dead.
Did you kill him because you couldn't have him?
Is that what you did?
[Gasps] Oh.
[Sighs]
MOLLY:
The red and yellow are human cells.
RICHTER:
And the blue?
Hybrid.
Gina, expand image to full res.
GINA:
Here's full res, Molly.
RICHTER:
That is a butt-load of blue.
Yeah, but as long as I still have human cells in my bone marrow, then I have an army to fight back.
I have to get into the lab at the GSC.
Maybe I can create a gene-knockout protocol with the spores... and find a way to stop the alien cells from reproducing.
But right now it may be my only chance to reverse this thing and get my son back.
- Ethan.
- What?
I'm supposed to be having a visitation with him right now.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That information I gave you about John's accident is pretty damning.
- I can't think about that right now, JD.
- No, you have to, all right?
The GSC is not your friend.
Tobias Shepherd is not your friend.
You go back to that lab and they find out what's going on with you,
- Molly, they're not gonna hesitate...
- To kill me.
I know.
- [Phone chimes]
- Hold on.
_
I got to go.
Please, whatever you do, just be careful.
- [Line ringing]
- This is Kelsey.
Leave it.
Kelsey, it's your dad.
In case you didn't recognize my voice from the first seven messages.
Listen, I'm sorry I missed your doctor's appointment.
I had something come up.
Just please call me back.
- All right?
Thank you.
- [Phone beeps off]
- [Doorbell chimes]
- Who is it, Hank?
HANK:
Molly Woods.
Intercom.
You weren't supposed to come until later in the afternoon.
MOLLY:
I know, Julie.
Something has changed.
Can I just see Ethan for two minutes, please?
It's okay, Mom.
- Unlock the door, Hank.
- HANK:
Door unlocked.
- Hi, Ethan.
- Hi, Molly.
What happened to your car?
He crashed.
You think I could talk to you for a second?
I know I told you that we were gonna spend time together.
And we will.
But you're just gonna have to wait a little while.
ETHAN:
How come?
Well, I'm...
I'm sick.
But I'm working really hard to get better.
How long will that take?
I'm not sure.
Now, you won't remember this, but... when I went away to space, you were really worried that I wouldn't come back.
And I promised you that I would.
And I kept that promise.
And I promise you...
I'm gonna come back.
Does that mean I stay with Julie?
Yeah.
She's gonna take really good care of you till I get better.
Okay?
SHEPHERD:
The hybrids have evolved.
Their cellular biology is extremely adaptive.
They seem to have realized that we were tracking them using thermal imaging, so they raised their core body temp from 84 degrees to 98.6.
Mimicking humans and hiding in plain sight.
If they look like us, feel like us, how was the Humanich able to make that determination?
Lucy.
My name is Lucy.
You can ask me the question.
Go ahead, Lucy.
Explain to them how you were able to differentiate between hybrid and human.
We all know hybrids look exactly like humans.
They could be any one of us.
See, I was in a crowded room... just like this one.
Scanning people.
Just as I am now.
Everyone's body temperature was 98.6, roughly.
But, see... there was a gentleman.
And he was different.
He was emitting delta waves, which the human brain only emits when sleeping.
And this fellow was very much awake.
When it became clear he was hybrid, knowing time was of the essence,
I made the call to terminate.
ANNA:
And it was the correct call, Lucy.
Thank you.
The last few weeks the hybrids have gone underground.
We don't know what they're doing.
But we know they're out there.
Multiplying.
Quickly.
They can blend in, manipulate our minds.
They've killed before and they'll kill again.
And humans are defenseless against them.
How soon can additional Humanichs like Lucy be ready for combat?
Right away, sir.
And what about the virus, Toby?
I thought Dr. Woods was helping us there.
The president has great concerns, as you know.
Well, I have news for the president.
About Dr. Woods.
RICHTER:
The GSC is not your friend.
Tobias Shepherd is not your friend.
You go back to that lab and they find out what's going on with you,
Molly, they're not gonna hesitate...
- MOLLY:
To kill me.
I know.
- SHEPHERD:
Molly.
There you are.
We need to talk.
It's important.
You really outdid yourself, Lucy.
That was quite the show.
_
What's the matter?
That's Molly.
Ethan's mother.
What about her?
_
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
As you know, there were concerns about putting you on the virus team.
I protected you.
I believed in you.
And you didn't disappoint.
Congratulations.
On what?
Nate took your research breakthrough and ran with it.
We've finished the virus, Molly.
Really?
Yeah.
When will it be deployed?
Well, we're gearing up for mass production immediately.
Thanks to you, we're gonna wipe those hybrids out permanently.
Cheers.
Cheers.
[Music playing]
Oh, crap.
[Music stops]
WOMAN:
You're a real jerk, you know that?
Nice to see you, too, Judge.
Dorothy.
"Judge" is more accurate.
I didn't realize you still had a key.
I don't.
Kelsey gave me hers.
She called me from the doctor's office today, upset.
Because her father promised he would be at her ultrasound appointment
- and then he never showed up.
- Yeah.
I screwed up.
I know.
I'll say one thing, you are consistent.
Missed all those birthday parties and school recitals.
- We gave up on Christmas, but...
- But...
She came to me first.
And not you, that's it.
She came to me, not you, and that's got you all kinds of pissed off.
No, what has me all kinds of pissed off is the fact that she gave you a second chance and you blew it.
[Scoffs] I knew you would, but she didn't.
Kids don't give up.
I am in the middle of something right now that I can't explain.
Oh, let me guess.
People's lives hang in the balance.
The fate of mankind is at stake.
- If I said yes?
- Don't be a jackass.
Here you go.
No.
No, you tell Kelsey to hold on to these just in case.
There is no "just in case," JD.
She asked me to give 'em back and to tell you never to call her again.
Hold on a second.
Our daughter is pregnant.
God knows where the father is.
So she's got nobody.
She needs us.
Both of us, Dorothy.
Apparently your daughter doesn't think so.
[Door shuts]
[Whirring]
[Woman and man exclaim]
Look out!
- Nice ride.
- Julie got it for me.
Hmm.
Someone's feeling pretty guilty.
What do you mean?
When humans do something wrong, they buy you stuff to make you forget.
[Chuckles] Oldest trick in the book.
Ethan, can you keep a secret?
Sure.
Today I made a lot of people very happy.
And because of that,
Julie's gonna be making a lot more Humanichs.
Pretty soon, there's gonna be a bunch of us.
- How does that sound?
- Good.
Good?
It's great.
Our family is expanding, little brother.
- You don't sound very happy.
- I am.
Happy.
Unless... you don't care because you're spending the afternoon with Molly.
No, I'm not, actually.
That's on hold for now.
Why?
She's not feeling well.
That's what she told you?
- And you believe her?
- Why would she lie?
Humans.
It's in their DNA.
Have I taught you nothing?
JULIE:
How many?
- A hundred.
- [Chuckles]
- Anna, we can't do that.
- Lucy's program is ready.
The bodies have been completed.
All you need to do is...
We can't release them without smoke tests.
That takes time.
Julie, grow up.
This is not a product launch, it is a war.
- With a very complicated enemy.
- I understand that.
But there's a reason John put these protocols in place.
- He would have never...
- Yes, but John isn't here, is he?
If you could just be a little open-minded, we can resume our life together.
Julie, we don't have a life together.
I'm gonna find Ethan and I'm gonna shut this thing down.
[Beep, line ringing]
- ANNA:
Yes.
- It's Julie.
I think I may have just really screwed up.
Start from the beginning.
I'll take care of it.
Employee 347 requesting access.
- LAB A.I.:
Security, please.
- 1127D.
I'm sorry.
That code is no longer valid.
What are you doing?
I need to get in here.
I need the spores.
What's the code?
The spores are gone.
They took them to produce the virus.
Where's the DNA sequencing?
It's backed up.
Why?
You can't do that.
Classified data is being copied onto an unauthorized drive.
- [Alarm beeping]
- I told you.
You can't do that.
_
Copy aborted.
Please obtain proper authorization.
Uh, hello.
I need Security.
GUARD:
Dr. Woods, stop.
I need to search your pockets.
I'm sorry, but I'm late for a meeting.
Dr. Woods.
[Elevator bell dings]
[Line ringing]
- RICHTER:
Molly?
- JD, it's me.
I'm in trouble.
[Engine shuts off]
All right, so you pulled some alarms and did some hocus-pocus on some guards.
I didn't do it on purpose, JD.
I can't control it.
- Did you at least ditch your car?
- Yeah.
I tossed my phone.
I took two buses to get here.
Trust me, I was not followed.
That doesn't mean they stopped looking.
The GSC has a virus to kill hybrids.
And they're gonna release it.
- I'm gonna die.
- Hey.
Don't talk like that.
You're not gonna die on my watch, okay?
I promise.
All right, come on.
Did she say why she wanted the spores?
You know Molly.
Not much of a Chatty Cathy.
She just started downloading onto that drive.
Well, any information that could be detrimental?
It depends what she does with it.
Like... if she goes public, yes.
GSC's gonna be looking for your car.
As soon as Shepherd figures it out, he's gonna be looking for mine as well.
But they won't be looking for this.
Is this yours?
A guy owes me a favor.
- [Sighs]
- Molly, what's the plan?
- Without the spores...
- I saw you do a DNA test with two paperclips and a bottle of iodine, all right?
If anybody can figure this out, it's you.
What I need is an exact gene pairing, and I can only get that from my son.
- The alien?
- Yeah.
I need his DNA.
And I know he's here.
Somewhere.
All right, just so you know, I can't plug "somewhere" into a GPS.
Okay.
Well, when he showed up at my apartment,
I knew that he was gonna be there before he got there, and somehow he knew that I was gonna be at that bar.
So...
What if hybrids have some kind of psychic connection?
All right, that is a huge "what if," Molly.
Well, he sent me a message, JD.
I heard voices, and that has to mean something.
I'm hearing voices right now, too, and they're telling me to put that tarp back on this car.
[Scoffs]
You know, lots of species communicate without words.
Bats, ants, dolphins.
I think what I need to do here is just figure out how to find his signal.
I guess we're going for a ride.
- [Engine starts]
- MALE VOICE:
Ignition activated.
[Engine roaring]
Are you comfortable?
The upload's gonna take a couple of hours.
Let me show you what we've developed.
- A.I., open viewing port.
- A.I.:
Opening viewing port.
100 Humanichs physically ready.
All they need is your neural algorithm.
LUCY:
Wait.
My experiential upload is going into all of those Humanichs?
When we first created the program, each Humanich was designed to be unique.
Shaped by their own experiences.
Like Ethan.
But with the alien threat, the plan changed.
- And you proved effective, so...
- Well, will I still be me?
Will they all be me?
Their experiences will make them unique, but... their baseline is all your algorithm, you.
Lucky them.
All right, you ready?
- [Beep]
- Neural paths activated.
Upload commencing.
[Electrical whirring]
[Indistinct chatter]
What did you find?
Sir, we've gone deep into our systems.
JD Richter seems to not exist.
No phone records, no real estate purchases.
His car doesn't have a tracker.
He's gone MIA.
Look, he's Patrol Special, a cop.
They should be able to find him, no?
When his license was revoked, he must have ditched the software.
You know, we've been driving around for a while.
Are you getting anything, any hint of a signal?
[Sighs] No.
Maybe I'm...
I'm doing it wrong.
I don't know.
All right, what's another way to send a message?
You got Morse code, smoke signal... message in a bottle?
Or... graphene drive.
Now, they sent me a message... so maybe I can send them one back.
- What's that?
- My files from the GSC.
I found a message encoded in their DNA.
[Distorted whispering]
That's it.
This is information encoded in the junk.
They sent a message from their home planet.
- Listen.
- What does it say?
"Help me."
I have this really cool game that we could play.
Soon you'll get to meet your sister.
[Beep]
JULIE:
Ethan?
What you got there?
I've been looking for you.
Can we talk for a minute?
About what?
About what happened with Molly.
I know things must be really confusing.
And I want you to know that I love you.
And Molly loves you, too.
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say.
Say what you feel.
You reprogrammed me not to feel.
That's not true.
And I can restore your program back to what it was at any time.
You can feel all those old feelings again, your memories of Molly.
If that's what you want.
And feel pain?
Sometimes pain is okay if it means you get to know the truth.
I already know.
Molly can't take care of me.
Unless that's a lie, too.
- Why would she lie about that?
- You lied.
I guess that's just what humans do, huh?
Can I take these pieces home?
I can use them to fix my old car.
Then I'll have two.
Sure.
RICHTER:
All right, we're here.
This is the highest point within a 50-mile radius.
[Digital chime, distorted whispering]
I don't know biology, but I do know with radio frequencies, the higher the altitude, the less interference with the signal.
Well, I just hope he's listening.
[Soft gasp]
All right, let me take a look at this.
Come on, we're friends.
Drop trou.
[Both chuckle]
Okay.
Oh, Molly.
This is infected.
We're gonna have to clean that and redress it.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm gonna warn you:
this is gonna sting.
Oh, oh.
- Oh.
- I told you.
Oh, God.
Mm-hmm.
You actually sound like you know what you're talking about.
D-minus in biology but an A-plus in combat triage.
Okay.
Well, I see you brought a lot of Second Kuwait back with you.
Radios, first aid.
What else you got?
Nothing useful.
Oh, oh...
- [Gunfire, men shouting]
- MAN:
Get down!
Incoming!
JD!
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
[Molly inhales, sighs]:
Nothing's happening.
[Sighs]
Maybe it's like doing a crossword puzzle.
You know when you get stuck on a word, you look away and the answer just pops into your head?
- You do crossword puzzles?
- No.
[Laughs]
So you were up there, huh?
13 months.
You know, I got my first telescope when I was seven.
I was obsessed with that thing.
I knew there had to be something else out there.
Be careful what you wish for.
What was it like?
Up there by yourself for so long.
It was better than I ever thought it would be.
I didn't have to lie up there.
I didn't have to... pretend to be somebody that I wasn't.
I could just... be.
I envy that.
I wish I could just... be.
Pretty sure I failed as a father.
No.
That's how you see you.
But that's not how I see you.
How do you see me?
I see... a kind, loving father.
A gentleman.
Wow.
I think that's the first time that anyone has ever used the word "gentleman" to describe me.
Well... that's 'cause they don't see you.
But I do.
And you're still here.
Yeah.
But so are you.
Yeah.
[Aural fractals sound]
- [Indistinct whispering]
- RICHTER:
What is it?
It's Ahdu.
I know where he is.
If you would've told me two months ago that I'd be following around an astronaut looking for aliens,
I'd have said you were nuts.
Well, two months ago, I was nuts.
We've been walking around in the middle of nowhere for hours.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
Hi.
We've been waiting for you.
I thought we were looking for one guy.
I wasn't quite prepared for "Alien Nation".
MOLLY:
I don't think they're gonna hurt you, so put that gun away.
You don't think?
You came.
Welcome home.
We only have a few minutes before she comes back.
[Laughs] What's the big secret?
Whoa.
This is Spyder.
He's our baby brother.
Wh...
What, you made him?
Impressive.
And look.
It's a camera.
Wow.
Spyder can keep his eyes and ears on humans
- when you're offline.
- And guess what.
I have enough for a few more Spyders.
Then our family will be even bigger.
[Chuckles]
And we can keep an eye on everybody.
You're my real family, Lucy.
I want to be a soldier like you.
[Chuckles] Someday you will be.
In the meantime, you build your army and I'll build mine.
AHDU:
We knew you'd find us.
Once you learned the truth.
Well, it wasn't easy.
You know what's happening to me, don't you?
You meeting me at that bar wasn't an accident.
You were drawn to me.
- We're the same.
- No.
We're not the same.
And I don't want to be the same.
- Thank you, Terra.
- You're welcome, Daddy.
- She's your...
- My daughter.
Yes.
We need to talk, Ahdu.
Privately.
Hey.
Are those your toys over there?
- Yeah.
Want to see?
- Absolutely.
I'll be right over here.
I need a sample of your DNA.
Your blood.
It's the only way I can figure out if I can reverse what's happening to me.
- Why?
- Why?
Because it's not me.
I'm hearing voices in my head.
I'm having urges that aren't me.
- I almost killed a man.
- Was he trying to hurt you?
- That's beside the point.
- But isn't that what humans do?
React when they're in danger?
Isn't that what you're doing right now?
Please.
Ethan needs me.
This is the only way.
Very well.
Aren't you at all curious?
Why do you want to run from something you don't yet understand?
I know what you are.
I know what you're doing.
All those women.
What is it you think I don't understand?
Well, if you knew the truth, you wouldn't be afraid.
You would be amazed.
Are you willing to learn?
This is the mommy, this is the daddy, and this is the baby.
What's Mommy doing?
Is she sleeping?
No, she's dead.
[Aural fractals sound]
[Voice whispering]:
Help me.
Help me.
- Get away from her.
- Stop.
[Exhales]
You understand now.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- His loss?
What about our loss?
What about those dead women?
It was never our intent to harm you.
RICHTER:
So much for good intentions.
- Molly, let's get out of here.
- AHDU:
Wait.
Can I show you something?
Please?
[Sighs]
[Elevator bell dings]
This is the one that I like, so if you could get that...
Anna.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Is there a problem?
Uh, no, the upload's complete.
The Humanichs are under way.
Well, then I would say we deserve a drink.
Uh, I don't want a drink.
I want answers.
About John's death.
What are you talking about?
After he left Humanichs that night,
I called you and you told me not to worry and that you would handle it.
And... 20 minutes later, he was dead.
Are you accusing me of murder?
Just tell me you didn't do it.
- That we didn't do it.
- Julie, that was an accident.
- A very convenient one.
- But still it was an accident.
Our hands are clean.
So stop with your conspiracy theories and get back to work.
Accusations like that can have repercussions.
RICHTER:
So what is this?
It's a memorial.
To commemorate every human life sacrificed to save us.
We didn't understand impregnating humans would cause their death.
We're not here to kill, we're here to survive.
To rebuild.
Sometimes "sorry" isn't enough, and this is one of those times.
We agree.
The deaths are unforgivable.
But we have managed to evolve.
Evolve?
How?
We procreate without causing harm to humans.
Hybrid births no longer kill the mothers.
That's why there hasn't been any more reported deaths.
Molly, we don't know that that's true.
We don't know what they want.
AHDU:
We want to coexist.
Peacefully.
I told you you'd have to make a choice.
Now is that time.
RICHTER:
You can't be serious, Molly.
They're people, for God's sakes.
Peaceful people.
We can't let the GSC unleash a virus.
- That's genocide.
- Okay, so... so the hybrids live, and then what?
We learn to coexist.
What did he do to you?
What did he show you?
- Their history.
- What about it?
They were a peaceful society on their planet, threatened with extinction by a virus.
Now, the spores were sent out to try to find a suitable host.
That's when they found me, on the Seraphim.
Molly...
They can mess with your head, your perception.
How do you know what he's telling you is true?
- Because I'm one of them.
- No, you're not.
- Yes!
You saw the triple helix.
- No!
You are infected with their DNA.
Come on.
We got what we came for.
We got Ahdu's DNA.
Now let's get out of here and take that back to the lab.
No.
What I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna explain this to Shepherd.
- You're officially certifiable.
- Look.
Healed.
I heal faster.
I think faster.
What we're dealing with here, JD, is evolution.
Survival of the fittest.
Now, what we ought to be doing is studying them, not trying to kill 'em!
No, we are talking about aliens here, Molly.
- Who are part human.
- And part not!
I don't think you understand how dangerous this all is.
I'm sorry, JD.
But I cannot be a part of slaughtering innocent children with a virus I created.
Now, if you do nothing and I do nothing, they are all gonna die.
Me included.
JULIE:
What do you say we go get some pizza on our way home?
Sure, if you want.
Why can't Lucy come with us?
Because I hardly ever see you and you like pizza.
Lucy likes pizza, too.
- [Elevator bell dings] - [Sighs]
- OTIS:
Floor, please.
- P2 parking, please.
Thank you, Otis.
- Otis, why are we going up?
- We are not going up, Julie.
Yes, we are.
We're going in the wrong direction, Otis.
Stop.
- Stop, Otis!
- [Thud]
That was weird.
Hold on, hold on!
Emergency override!
Stop!
Stop the elevator!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop, stop!
Have a good evening, Julie, and a safe ride home.
- Are you okay?
- Sure.
These are African elephants.
Want to know why?
Because the mom and dad...
[Indistinct conversations]
So what do you think?
I think we've found our new leader.
[Sobbing quietly]
[Beeps twice]
[Groans]
It's time for you and I to have a little chat.
How the hell did you get in here?
This gun says I don't answer questions.
Ah.
You looking for this?
Oh, yeah, I dismantled your little panic button.
Cool feature, very high-tech.
So where are we going?
How about you just drive.
[Engine starts]
[Woman speaks Chinese]
TRANSLATING DEVICE:
My son was so strong.
- [Speaks Chinese]
- So happy.
[Speaks Chinese]
I thought he was a gift from God.
But a full-term baby after just a two-month pregnancy?
You must have known that wasn't normal.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
[Device translating into Chinese]
- You're undocumented.
- [Device translates]
- Then what happened?
- [Device translates]
- [Speaks Chinese]
- He just grew so fast.
- [Speaks Chinese]
- Before I knew it, he was walking.
- [Speaks Chinese]
- Talking.
One day...
I saw him standing in front of the sliding door... staring out the window at nothing.
He said, "mommy..."
they're calling me.
- [Speaks Chinese]
- I have to go.
- [Speaks Chinese]
- And then he was gone.
- Who was calling him?
- [Device translates into Chinese]
- [Speaks Chinese]
- The devil.
Sit.
Hello, Toby.
[Exhales]
Do you have any idea the position you just put me in?
Put yourselves in?
Not so great being in the hot seat, is it?
- This is an abduction.
- No, it's not.
It's a negotiation.
- You're really stoked about this, huh?
- Yeah.
Once they wake up, my family's going to be even bigger.
- Your family?
- Yeah.
Lucy's my sister, so that makes all these new Humanichs my brothers and sisters.
- So what does that make me?
- My BHF.
- Your what?
- My Best Human Friend.
You never lied to me or reprogrammed me.
Or left me.
And I never will.
You're my BHF.
My Best Humanich Friend.
I love you, bud.
Lucy!
I've been released from diagnostics.
They said you were going online.
Can I see?
Yeah, sure.
We're just about to fire this guy up.
Man, it's too bad Julie's in D.C.
- She's missing the fruits of her labor.
- And you're missing her.
We're not talking about me, we're talking about this guy.
He doesn't have a name?
No, not yet.
You want to do the honors?
♪ ♪
Lucas.
His name is Lucas.
All right.
Let's do this thing.
Hi, Charlie.
Lucy.
Ethan.
Hello, Lucas.
What exactly are you proposing here?
Peace.
Coexistence.
Coexistence with the hybrids means the end of the human race.
- Extinction.
- [Sighs]:
Maybe not.
Maybe... it's just a new beginning.
We haven't even thought of the possibilities.
[Laughs softly]
What possibilities?
They're smarter than us.
They heal faster.
Their DNA just might contain a medical magic bullet.
They control your thoughts, make you do whatever they damn well please.
Now, we can talk pros and cons all day long, Molly,
- they're still a threat.
- They're not killing women anymore.
- They've evolved.
- Yeah.
They've gone underground, somewhere.
And obviously you know where.
Toby, come on.
They're half human, for God's sakes.
There's women, there's children.
Can you expand your mind for just two seconds?
Damn it, Molly!
What'd you expect me to do?
Huh?
There is no universe... where this makes sense to anybody except you.
Bup-bup-bup.
Sit back down, General.
Nobody said you could get up.
Okay.
Look, Toby.
All I'm asking you to do is broker... some sort of peace conference.
You can see for yourselves who they are before you unleash a virus that will destroy them.
That's got to be better than genocide.
Toby, please.
[Sighs]
You made me lie to Congress.
What if I told them the truth?
That you knew about this so-called invasion... but you kept it hidden.
Your word against mine.
I'd pass that BMI polygraph in two seconds.
You would be discredited.
Lose your stripes, your honor.
[Whispers]:
Everything.
How do I get in touch with you?
You have 24 hours to talk to your people.
Then we'll be in touch.
- Toby, where the hell have you been?
- We need to assemble the team.
First there is something you need to see.
Can you tell me what you told the nurse?
- What is happening to you?
- [Woman speaking Chinese]
TRANSLATING DEVICE:
My hair and fingernails... they're growing so fast.
I hear strange voices in my head that won't stop telling me to do shameful things.
Do you believe that my son is a demon?
Is he a demon?
Tell me!
[Beep]
- Who is she?
- Mei Fong.
Illegal.
Nate's with her in the Faraday Unit now.
He's running a CMP, a whole-exome sequence,
- and a marrow extract.
- Good.
We need to find out exactly what happened to her.
[Birds chirping]
What are we doing here?
We are picking up stuff for a rainy day.
Open the damn door.
- A.I.:
Welcome back, Mr. Richter.
- "Open the damn door"?
- That's your password?
- Easy to remember.
Okay, we got to grab night kits, H2O extractors, and solar bundles.
You really think we need all this stuff?
Tobias Shepherd is capable of just about anything.
And I am prepared for...
just about anything.
He's not evil, JD.
He's...
- he's just complicated.
- Complicated?
That's the word you use to describe him?
[Sighs]
Complicated.
Dr. Woods believes the hybrids have evolved... that they no longer pose an immediate threat.
She's asked for a détente.
For us to sit down with her son... and find a way to coexist in peace.
There will be no détente.
I'm not gonna be the man who presided over a mass extinction.
We have the virus.
We have the Humanichs.
- This ends now.
- What about Dr. Woods?
Dr. Woods has chosen her side.
She stands with the enemy.
We'll treat her like the enemy.
[Helicopter whirs in distance]
How do you know we're not being tracked?
The jeep is untrackable by satellite, thanks to a few contraptions my buddy Ray made for me.
Okay, look,
I know we're not on a major highway, but... have you noticed that for the past few miles we've seen nobody?
No cars, no people... nothing.
Yeah.
I noticed.
- [Sighs]
- Where is everybody?
With shocking news that affects the entire region.
There is an at-large terrorist cell in our midst bearing biological weapons.
This Red-Level emergency lockdown will remain in place for 72 hours.
The alleged terrorists have been identified as former astronaut and GSC employee Dr. Molly Woods and disgraced Second Kuwait War veteran
- James Daniel Richter...
- So he destroyed our credibility... before we could destroy his.
Your "complicated" friend... just made us the most wanted people in the world.
Do you remember Paris?
I remember climbing the Eiffel Tower and running down the Champs-Élysées.
- It was raining, but...
- There was a nice old lady.
- And she gave me her umbrella.
- It had a hole in it.
- BOTH:
I was soaked.
- [Laughs]
So you have all the same memories?
Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.
- They all do.
- Our memories were installed.
We didn't have the luxury of learning by experience, like you.
But I want to have memories with both of you, too.
Okay.
Well... let's make some right now.
Just the three of us.
Charlie, will you take a picture of us with my Pyxis Cube?
Yeah.
LUCAS:
What's that?
It's a place where people keep their most important memories.
Kind of like an old-school photo album, if you're into that sort of stuff.
_
ETHAN:
Lucy, turn around, smile.
Sorry.
Let's do it.
Everybody say "cheese and crackers."
[Siren wailing in distance, alarm beeping]
What's going on?
What's going on is, we are in a security lockdown.
What does that mean?
It means we're not going anywhere for the moment.
Shepherd betrayed us.
He's looking for you.
And us, too.
- We're gonna have to stay in hiding.
- We don't want to hide.
We want to live and go about in the world freely.
Well, I don't want to be the person to break the news to you, but you are a long way from that.
We all are at this point.
Okay, look, JD has supplies and food.
He's ex-military, so he can help with defense.
I can at least help you secure the perimeter.
Mm-mm, no.
We're not taking orders from one of them.
I'm sorry, who the hell are you?
This is Ares.
JD.
Molly.
Hey, new guy, I laid my ass on the line for you people.
- "You people."
- Our mother trusts him.
Your mother... doesn't know which side she's on.
Okay, look, this isn't about sides.
It's about survival.
For all of us.
We won't survive here.
We should leave now.
Scatter into the cities, propagate until the odds are in our favor,
- then let the humans decide...
- Decide what?
If they want to live in our world... or die in theirs.
I thought you wanted peace.
It takes two sides for peace, doesn't it?
RICHTER:
All right, there is a five-county lockdown in place.
Anybody who leaves here, they will be hunted down, captured and killed.
And if we stay here, we're sitting ducks.
Yeah.
But they don't know where the ducks are sitting.
Now, the GSC has a virus... that can kill all of us.
RICHTER:
The streets are empty right now.
One person leaves this compound, just one... it's gonna lead the GSC right back to us.
If we wait out the lockdown, it'll make it easier for us to disperse.
It's only 72 hours.
Now, we will stay here until then, help JD secure the grounds.
If that's your decision, brother.
TERRA:
Molly!
- Terra.
- You came back.
Of course.
- LUCY:
Hey.
- Oh.
Hey there.
Find out how long we'll be here?
Um...
I just got a special security clearance.
- We are going home tonight.
- That's good.
Uh, Ethan asked if Lucas and I could spend the night with you guys.
- I told him it was up to you.
- No.
Lucas isn't ready.
We have to power him down here.
Okay.
Well, what about me?
I think with Julie in Washington, he gets lonely.
- And you must, too.
- Me?
No, I'm fine.
But, uh... yeah, for Ethan?
Sure.
Why not?
Charlie...
I found your checklist for Humanichs.
What's an expiration date?
[Clears throat] You're not supposed to be snooping...
I wasn't snooping.
I was looking.
John Woods made it very clear that he wanted Humanichs to have the human experience, so he built in a program for them to expire.
You mean... die.
I mean... humans die.
It's just part of the deal.
It sort of defines us.
To make Humanichs more human, it just seemed logical to build in... a termination point.
It's not logical to me.
Humans have to die, we don't.
If you want us to be more like you, then give us the same rights.
Let us really live before we die.
[Both sigh]
Look, I'm so sorry you had to find out that way.
I know it's a lot to absorb.
You're responding like any human would.
Because I'm more human than you think, Charlie.
I wish you understood that.
Believe it or not, Mei Fong's DNA has somehow... been converted to a triple helix.
So you're saying, conclusively, that this woman is a hybrid?
She will be.
Soon.
A casualty of microchimerism.
We think there was a placental transfer of alien fetal cells during the pregnancy.
Does this happen to every woman who survives a hybrid pregnancy?
I don't know.
Mei has a rare genetic marker called the "Kilimanjaro Allele".
It might be why she's changing and others aren't.
Run that marker through our employee database.
Only one person with that same anomaly.
Molly Woods.
Can you stop the progression in this woman?
Maybe, with a full plasma and marrow transplant, but...
- it could kill her.
- Do it.
We need her consent.
With all due respect, she has rights.
Mei Fong is now an enemy of the state.
Consent is not required.
You have your orders.
We thought Molly Woods was on the other side.
It turns out she is the other side.
- Where are you going?
- To see Taylor.
Don't you think it's about time I met him?
When Taylor thinks it's necessary, he'll let me know.
I figure we might want to get one or two of these things running.
- What?
- Why are you doing this?
You know, when I was a kid, my dad and I, we used to take old cars and work on them...
I'm... not talking about the engines.
I'm an enemy of the state now, Molly.
Not a lot of options.
You could just dump all this stuff off and leave.
I'm not a deserter.
- I'm not saying that you are.
- Molly.
Heleos and some others have volunteered to keep watch.
We're making up sleeping quarters.
We weren't sure whether you wanted one bed or two.
You know what?
I, uh...
I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
- I'm gonna keep watch with...
- Heleos.
Yeah, Heleos and I are gonna keep watch.
Come.
Let's get you settled.
So, Heleos, how old are you, one month or two?
- Excuse me?
- [Chuckles softly]
Never mind.
Gallows humor.
Come on.

Tobias Shepherd.

Alexander the Great tetradrachma.
Object confirmed.
Hello, Taylor.
Hello, General Shepherd.
What can I do for you?
I need analysis of every location that might serve
- as a compound for the hybrids.
- Certainly, General.
When would you like these projections?
- Yesterday.
- That's impossible.
Can I assume that's sarcasm?
Yeah.
You can.
It is.
Just get it done.

Stop it!
Right now!

No, no, no.
JD, no!
No, stop!
He's running our perimeter lines.
I thought we should get to know the man in charge of our survival.
Yeah, is that how you treat your friends?
He's your friend.
A man unfaithful to his wife;
left his daughter;
and who had a hand in the deaths of hundreds of his own kind.
And you...
- You ask us to trust that?
- Okay, you need to go.
[Exhales]
He's just trying to protect us.
Yeah, I feel real safe.
Heleos.
48 hours, and we were done here.
Meaning?
Meaning this was supposed to be a pit stop, not a parking lot.
When we first got here, it was about you figuring out how to reverse what was happening to you.
I don't hear you talking about that anymore.
Because I don't even know if I can reverse it.
You've stopped trying!
These people, they aren't like us.
All right?
They are unknown.
And what am I?
Am I an unknown?
You need to figure out which world you want to live in.
You can't have both.
CHARLIE:
All right.
What do you think?
An oldie but a goodie?
I'm sick of children's stories.
I want something more grown-up, like Lucy would read.
Oh, really?
Like what?
Uh, well...
Julie's been reading "Huckleberry Finn."
- How about that?
- Really?
- Julie said she's reading that?
- It's supposed to be a classic.
Very advanced thematically.
- I want that one.
- Okay.
Got to cater to your audience.

And you're wondering if you should be here...
- or with Ethan.
- You see?
See, you are in my head.
You know my thoughts and my feelings, and that's what I don't want.
You can control what's happening to you, Molly.
The headaches, the urges.
You see that they've already started to recede.
I don't know what I am.
Yes, you do.
And your best chance of survival is embracing that.
Why are you still awake?
Why aren't you powered down?

Yeah?
What do you want that you can't have?
Lucy...
Sometimes you like to remind me that I'm just a machine.
You're not just a machine;
you know that.
The more human experience you give me, the more human I become.
I can be so much more if you let me.
Wait, hold on.

Wait, this is...
this is illegal.
It's like misuse of government property or something.
Is that all I am?

We have task forces combing every hot spot Taylor gave us.
Still no trace of where the hybrids are hiding out.
We haven't lost yet.
No?
With schools, banks and business districts still shuttered, there is outrage over the disruption of everyday lives.
With public pressure mounting to end this lockdown, there is still no word on the whereabouts of former astronaut Molly Woods and her accomplice, disgraced war veteran JD Richter.
They're fighting this thing like a war.
But it's not a war, it's a scourge.
We're running out of time.
- We need to get personal.
- Meaning?
Everyone has their Achilles' heel.
- What do they want?
- Even JD Richter.
NEWSWOMAN:
With this lockdown due to end in 24 hours, will the GSC dare to extend it and risk rioting in the streets?
And in another twist, Kelsey Richter, daughter of suspected terrorist JD Richter and circuit court judge Dorothy Richter, was taken into custody today...
- What the hell?
- under the Loyalty Act.
So the seven beautiful sisters were playing in the meadow, and then along came... a hunter... named Orion.
And Orion wanted the sisters all to himself, so he chased them to the ends of the earth.
But just when he thought he had them trapped, the most powerful god in the universe,
Zeus... came along to rescue them.
You came to rescue us from the hunters.
Are you a god?
No.
None of us are gods.
But you're still what Daddy says you are.
- And what is that?
- Our leader.
We have to talk.
How can they do that?
That BS about aiding a terror cell.
There's no depth Shepherd and his cronies won't sink to.
He just wants to get your attention.
- He got it.
- What are you gonna do?
I don't know, but I can't sit in Sherwood Forest hoping they live up to the ideals of the Constitution.
I can't.
I won't.
I'm sorry.
You're not going anywhere.
Seriously, man, you gonna stop me?
- Ares.
- He knows our location.
He could lead them straight to us.
- You don't know me very well.
- I know humans.
And I'm not about to bet our futures on your professed loyalty.
JD, don't!
Ares, stop it!
This is not a prison.
He's free to go.
Yeah, he's going.
Hey!
Get away from there!
Get away!
I thought by now you'd have some intel on where the hybrids might be hiding.
TAALR:
So did I, General.
But to my surprise, initial sat-scans came up negative.
- So, what, we have nothing?
- Not yet.
But I am currently exploring a new theory.
- I'm listening.
- In order to find life, perhaps we should be looking for the absence of it.
Meaning?
If the hybrids could emit an EMP powerful enough, they could create a thermal hole in my sat-scans.
- A blind spot.
- Precisely.
Which would allow them to hide in plain sight.
What am I looking at?
Osgood Listening Station.
Closed in 2025 due to defense budget cuts.
This is an old satellite image of the area.
This was shot this morning.
Something is blocking my scans, something that wasn't there six months ago.
Gated... tunnel systems, easily defendable...
Well, this has to be it.
What's your recommendation?
Release the virus in conjunction with the deployment of the Humanichs army.
And if we withheld release of the virus?
In 6.5 months, the Homo sapiens genome will be diluted to the point that an extinction event is inevitable.

Charlie, what is that?
You're being called up.
ETHAN:
Lucy, are you leaving?

Yes.

I want to stay here and play video games and go outside, but that is not my function... is it, Charlie?
So, no, Ethan, you can't come with me.

You never will be.
Hey.
I'm sorry about last night.
Don't worry.
At least not today.
We have reason to believe the target is located at the coordinates currently being uploaded to your nav system.

HELEOS:
Who are you?
Hi.
I'm Lucy.
This is, uh, my friend Lucas.
We're just out here deer hunting.
We lost the buck we were chasing.
You're not humans.
What are you?
Take him.
General Shepherd, we found them.
All of them.
I went to space on a 13-month solo mission.
I didn't come home alone.
The child, part human, part alien, was unlike anything the world had ever seen.
My other child...
- is a lifelike android.
- Mom?
He has become the prototype for a new breed of thinking machines... called Humanichs.
These two extraordinary new life-forms now hold the key to Earth's future.
But where does that leave us?
Over 99% of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct.
What if it's our time?
Previously on Extant...
- You haven't told me your name.
- Ahdu.
- Who is he?
- My son.
There are 29 known deaths.
All women who died from accelerated pregnancies.
All of which trace back to your son.
Dad, I'm pregnant.
Do they know you haven't put the limiters on me yet?
Lucy made her first hybrid kill.
Ethan, I'm your mother.
No.
She is.
How the hell did Julie Gelineau end up with my son?
- It's complicated.
- When things get complicated... does somebody end up getting hit by a train?
Unlock the door!
I don't care how many times you try to erase me from his memory.
- I'm his mother.
- Look at yourself, Molly.
Are you even capable of taking care of a child?
Something is happening to me.
I'm going crazy.
Don't touch me!
- Who did that?
- I think I did.
- So that's...
- My DNA.
Yeah.
- It's a triple helix.
- Triple?
Human DNA is a double helix, if memory serves.
It was me, JD.
I caused that guy to run into traffic.
I'm changing.
Into what?
Somehow... my DNA has combined with alien DNA.
I think I'm becoming a cross-breed of species.
How is that even possible?
Maybe it happened with the spores when I was in space.
Maybe the GSC did something to you.
Or maybe... the baby did.
You took biology, right?
I was a solid D-minus student like 30 years ago, so don't ask to test my recall.
Okay.
Well, there's something called a fetal microchimerism.
During pregnancy, a mother and child share cells and DNA.
Now, the fetal cells can linger in a mother's body for decades, altering her blood and her brain.
But if the baby you're carrying isn't human...
Exactly.
So the headaches, the voices, the sexual appetite... it all makes sense now.
The leftover alien cells have changed my essential DNA.
All right, so why can't you just change it back?
There's no way I can tell if I can reverse this until I know how far it's gone.
Now...
I need you to extract my bone marrow.
- With this?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Molly, we need to go to a hospital.
We need to at least be somewhere sterile.
We can't.
They keep records.
Molly.
This is gonna hurt.
No, it won't.
Just gave myself a kick-ass numbing agent.
Come on, right here.
Never a dull moment.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Oh...
And in my estimation, it is in Ethan's best interest to be allowed to spend time with Dr. Woods.
And for her to regain custody.
My husband is dead.
Did you kill him because you couldn't have him?
Is that what you did?
Oh.
The red and yellow are human cells.
And the blue?
Hybrid.
Gina, expand image to full res.
Here's full res, Molly.
That is a butt-load of blue.
Yeah, but as long as I still have human cells in my bone marrow, then I have an army to fight back.
I have to get into the lab at the GSC.
Maybe I can create a gene-knockout protocol with the spores... and find a way to stop the alien cells from reproducing.
But right now it may be my only chance to reverse this thing and get my son back.
- Ethan.
- What?
I'm supposed to be having a visitation with him right now.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That information I gave you about John's accident is pretty damning.
- I can't think about that right now, JD.
- No, you have to, all right?
The GSC is not your friend.
Tobias Shepherd is not your friend.
You go back to that lab and they find out what's going on with you,
- Molly, they're not gonna hesitate...
- To kill me.
I know.
Hold on.

I got to go.
Please, whatever you do, just be careful.
This is Kelsey.

Intercom.
You weren't supposed to come until later in the afternoon.
I know, Julie.
Something has changed.
Can I just see Ethan for two minutes, please?
It's okay, Mom.
- Unlock the door, Hank.
- Door unlocked.
- Hi, Ethan.
- Hi, Molly.
What happened to your car?
He crashed.
You think I could talk to you for a second?
I know I told you that we were gonna spend time together.
And we will.
But you're just gonna have to wait a little while.
How come?
Well, I'm...
I'm sick.
But I'm working really hard to get better.
How long will that take?
I'm not sure.
Now, you won't remember this, but... when I went away to space, you were really worried that I wouldn't come back.
And I promised you that I would.
And I kept that promise.
And I promise you...
I'm gonna come back.
Does that mean I stay with Julie?
Yeah.
She's gonna take really good care of you till I get better.
Okay?
The hybrids have evolved.
Their cellular biology is extremely adaptive.
They seem to have realized that we were tracking them using thermal imaging, so they raised their core body temp from 84 degrees to 98.6.
Mimicking humans and hiding in plain sight.
If they look like us, feel like us, how was the Humanich able to make that determination?
Lucy.
My name is Lucy.
You can ask me the question.
Go ahead, Lucy.
Explain to them how you were able to differentiate between hybrid and human.
We all know hybrids look exactly like humans.
They could be any one of us.
See, I was in a crowded room... just like this one.
Scanning people.
Just as I am now.
Everyone's body temperature was 98.6, roughly.
But, see... there was a gentleman.
And he was different.
He was emitting delta waves, which the human brain only emits when sleeping.
And this fellow was very much awake.
When it became clear he was hybrid, knowing time was of the essence,
I made the call to terminate.
And it was the correct call, Lucy.
Thank you.
The last few weeks the hybrids have gone underground.
We don't know what they're doing.
But we know they're out there.
Multiplying.
Quickly.
They can blend in, manipulate our minds.
They've killed before and they'll kill again.
And humans are defenseless against them.
How soon can additional Humanichs like Lucy be ready for combat?
Right away, sir.
And what about the virus, Toby?
I thought Dr. Woods was helping us there.
The president has great concerns, as you know.
Well, I have news for the president.
About Dr. Woods.
The GSC is not your friend.
Tobias Shepherd is not your friend.
You go back to that lab and they find out what's going on with you,
Molly, they're not gonna hesitate...
- To kill me.
I know.
- Molly.
There you are.
We need to talk.
It's important.
You really outdid yourself, Lucy.
That was quite the show.
_
What's the matter?
That's Molly.
Ethan's mother.
What about her?
_
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
As you know, there were concerns about putting you on the virus team.
I protected you.
I believed in you.
And you didn't disappoint.
Congratulations.
On what?
Nate took your research breakthrough and ran with it.
We've finished the virus, Molly.
Really?
Yeah.
When will it be deployed?
Well, we're gearing up for mass production immediately.
Thanks to you, we're gonna wipe those hybrids out permanently.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Oh, crap.
You're a real jerk, you know that?
Nice to see you, too, Judge.
Dorothy.
"Judge" is more accurate.
I didn't realize you still had a key.
I don't.
Kelsey gave me hers.
She called me from the doctor's office today, upset.
Because her father promised he would be at her ultrasound appointment
- and then he never showed up.
- Yeah.
I screwed up.
I know.
I'll say one thing, you are consistent.
Missed all those birthday parties and school recitals.
- We gave up on Christmas, but...
- But...
She came to me first.
And not you, that's it.
She came to me, not you, and that's got you all kinds of pissed off.
No, what has me all kinds of pissed off is the fact that she gave you a second chance and you blew it.
I knew you would, but she didn't.
Kids don't give up.
I am in the middle of something right now that I can't explain.
Oh, let me guess.
People's lives hang in the balance.
The fate of mankind is at stake.
- If I said yes?
- Don't be a jackass.
Here you go.
No.
No, you tell Kelsey to hold on to these just in case.
There is no "just in case," JD.
She asked me to give 'em back and to tell you never to call her again.
Hold on a second.
Our daughter is pregnant.
God knows where the father is.
So she's got nobody.
She needs us.
Both of us, Dorothy.
Apparently your daughter doesn't think so.
Look out!
- Nice ride.
- Julie got it for me.
Hmm.
Someone's feeling pretty guilty.
What do you mean?
When humans do something wrong, they buy you stuff to make you forget.
Oldest trick in the book.
Ethan, can you keep a secret?
Sure.
Today I made a lot of people very happy.
And because of that,
Julie's gonna be making a lot more Humanichs.
Pretty soon, there's gonna be a bunch of us.
- How does that sound?
- Good.
Good?
It's great.
Our family is expanding, little brother.
- You don't sound very happy.
- I am.
Happy.
Unless... you don't care because you're spending the afternoon with Molly.
No, I'm not, actually.
That's on hold for now.
Why?
She's not feeling well.
That's what she told you?
- And you believe her?
- Why would she lie?
Humans.
It's in their DNA.
Have I taught you nothing?
How many?
A hundred.
- Anna, we can't do that.
- Lucy's program is ready.
The bodies have been completed.
All you need to do is...
We can't release them without smoke tests.
That takes time.
Julie, grow up.
This is not a product launch, it is a war.
- With a very complicated enemy.
- I understand that.
But there's a reason John put these protocols in place.
- He would have never...
- Yes, but John isn't here, is he?
If you could just be a little open-minded, we can resume our life together.
Julie, we don't have a life together.
I'm gonna find Ethan and I'm gonna shut this thing down.
- Yes.
- It's Julie.
I think I may have just really screwed up.
Start from the beginning.
I'll take care of it.
Employee 347 requesting access.
- Security, please.
- 1127D.
I'm sorry.
That code is no longer valid.
What are you doing?
I need to get in here.
I need the spores.
What's the code?
The spores are gone.
They took them to produce the virus.
Where's the DNA sequencing?
It's backed up.
Why?
You can't do that.
Classified data is being copied onto an unauthorized drive.
I told you.
You can't do that.
_
Copy aborted.
Please obtain proper authorization.
Uh, hello.
I need Security.
Dr. Woods, stop.
I need to search your pockets.
I'm sorry, but I'm late for a meeting.
Dr. Woods.
- Molly?
- JD, it's me.
I'm in trouble.
All right, so you pulled some alarms and did some hocus-pocus on some guards.
I didn't do it on purpose, JD.
I can't control it.
- Did you at least ditch your car?
- Yeah.
I tossed my phone.
I took two buses to get here.
Trust me, I was not followed.
That doesn't mean they stopped looking.
The GSC has a virus to kill hybrids.
And they're gonna release it.
- I'm gonna die.
- Hey.
Don't talk like that.
You're not gonna die on my watch, okay?
I promise.
All right, come on.
Did she say why she wanted the spores?
You know Molly.
Not much of a Chatty Cathy.
She just started downloading onto that drive.
Well, any information that could be detrimental?
It depends what she does with it.
Like... if she goes public, yes.
GSC's gonna be looking for your car.
As soon as Shepherd figures it out, he's gonna be looking for mine as well.
But they won't be looking for this.
Is this yours?
A guy owes me a favor.
Molly, what's the plan?
- Without the spores...
- I saw you do a DNA test with two paperclips and a bottle of iodine, all right?
If anybody can figure this out, it's you.
What I need is an exact gene pairing, and I can only get that from my son.
- The alien?
- Yeah.
I need his DNA.
And I know he's here.
Somewhere.
All right, just so you know, I can't plug "somewhere" into a GPS.
Okay.
Well, when he showed up at my apartment,
I knew that he was gonna be there before he got there, and somehow he knew that I was gonna be at that bar.
So...
What if hybrids have some kind of psychic connection?
All right, that is a huge "what if," Molly.
Well, he sent me a message, JD.
I heard voices, and that has to mean something.
I'm hearing voices right now, too, and they're telling me to put that tarp back on this car.
You know, lots of species communicate without words.
Bats, ants, dolphins.
I think what I need to do here is just figure out how to find his signal.
I guess we're going for a ride.
Ignition activated.
Are you comfortable?
The upload's gonna take a couple of hours.
Let me show you what we've developed.
- A.I., open viewing port.
- Opening viewing port.
100 Humanichs physically ready.
All they need is your neural algorithm.
Wait.
My experiential upload is going into all of those Humanichs?
When we first created the program, each Humanich was designed to be unique.
Shaped by their own experiences.
Like Ethan.
But with the alien threat, the plan changed.
- And you proved effective, so...
- Well, will I still be me?
Will they all be me?
Their experiences will make them unique, but... their baseline is all your algorithm, you.
Lucky them.
All right, you ready?
Neural paths activated.
Upload commencing.
What did you find?
Sir, we've gone deep into our systems.
JD Richter seems to not exist.
No phone records, no real estate purchases.
His car doesn't have a tracker.
He's gone MIA.
Look, he's Patrol Special, a cop.
They should be able to find him, no?
When his license was revoked, he must have ditched the software.
You know, we've been driving around for a while.
Are you getting anything, any hint of a signal?
No.
Maybe I'm...
I'm doing it wrong.
I don't know.
All right, what's another way to send a message?
You got Morse code, smoke signal... message in a bottle?
Or... graphene drive.
Now, they sent me a message... so maybe I can send them one back.
- What's that?
- My files from the GSC.
I found a message encoded in their DNA.
That's it.
This is information encoded in the junk.
They sent a message from their home planet.
- Listen.
- What does it say?
"Help me."
I have this really cool game that we could play.
Soon you'll get to meet your sister.
Ethan?
What you got there?
I've been looking for you.
Can we talk for a minute?
About what?
About what happened with Molly.
I know things must be really confusing.
And I want you to know that I love you.
And Molly loves you, too.
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say.
Say what you feel.
You reprogrammed me not to feel.
That's not true.
And I can restore your program back to what it was at any time.
You can feel all those old feelings again, your memories of Molly.
If that's what you want.
And feel pain?
Sometimes pain is okay if it means you get to know the truth.
I already know.
Molly can't take care of me.
Unless that's a lie, too.
- Why would she lie about that?
- You lied.
I guess that's just what humans do, huh?
Can I take these pieces home?
I can use them to fix my old car.
Then I'll have two.
Sure.
All right, we're here.
This is the highest point within a 50-mile radius.
I don't know biology, but I do know with radio frequencies, the higher the altitude, the less interference with the signal.
Well, I just hope he's listening.
All right, let me take a look at this.
Come on, we're friends.
Drop trou.
Okay.
Oh, Molly.
This is infected.
We're gonna have to clean that and redress it.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm gonna warn you:
this is gonna sting.
Oh, oh.
- Oh.
- I told you.
Oh, God.
Mm-hmm.
You actually sound like you know what you're talking about.
D-minus in biology but an A-plus in combat triage.
Okay.
Well, I see you brought a lot of Second Kuwait back with you.
Radios, first aid.
What else you got?
Nothing useful.
Oh, oh...
Get down!
Incoming!
JD!
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
Nothing's happening.
Maybe it's like doing a crossword puzzle.
You know when you get stuck on a word, you look away and the answer just pops into your head?
- You do crossword puzzles?
- No.
So you were up there, huh?
13 months.
You know, I got my first telescope when I was seven.
I was obsessed with that thing.
I knew there had to be something else out there.
Be careful what you wish for.
What was it like?
Up there by yourself for so long.
It was better than I ever thought it would be.
I didn't have to lie up there.
I didn't have to... pretend to be somebody that I wasn't.
I could just... be.
I envy that.
I wish I could just... be.
Pretty sure I failed as a father.
No.
That's how you see you.
But that's not how I see you.
How do you see me?
I see... a kind, loving father.
A gentleman.
Wow.
I think that's the first time that anyone has ever used the word "gentleman" to describe me.
Well... that's 'cause they don't see you.
But I do.
And you're still here.
Yeah.
But so are you.
Yeah.
What is it?
It's Ahdu.
I know where he is.
If you would've told me two months ago that I'd be following around an astronaut looking for aliens,
I'd have said you were nuts.
Well, two months ago, I was nuts.
We've been walking around in the middle of nowhere for hours.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah.
Hi.
We've been waiting for you.
I thought we were looking for one guy.
I wasn't quite prepared for "Alien Nation".
I don't think they're gonna hurt you, so put that gun away.
You don't think?
You came.
Welcome home.
We only have a few minutes before she comes back.
What's the big secret?
Whoa.
This is Spyder.
He's our baby brother.
Wh...
What, you made him?
Impressive.
And look.
It's a camera.
Wow.
Spyder can keep his eyes and ears on humans
- when you're offline.
- And guess what.
I have enough for a few more Spyders.
Then our family will be even bigger.
And we can keep an eye on everybody.
You're my real family, Lucy.
I want to be a soldier like you.
Someday you will be.
In the meantime, you build your army and I'll build mine.
We knew you'd find us.
Once you learned the truth.
Well, it wasn't easy.
You know what's happening to me, don't you?
You meeting me at that bar wasn't an accident.
You were drawn to me.
- We're the same.
- No.
We're not the same.
And I don't want to be the same.
- Thank you, Terra.
- You're welcome, Daddy.
- She's your...
- My daughter.
Yes.
We need to talk, Ahdu.
Privately.
Hey.
Are those your toys over there?
- Yeah.
Want to see?
- Absolutely.
I'll be right over here.
I need a sample of your DNA.
Your blood.
It's the only way I can figure out if I can reverse what's happening to me.
- Why?
- Why?
Because it's not me.
I'm hearing voices in my head.
I'm having urges that aren't me.
- I almost killed a man.
- Was he trying to hurt you?
- That's beside the point.
- But isn't that what humans do?
React when they're in danger?
Isn't that what you're doing right now?
Please.
Ethan needs me.
This is the only way.
Very well.
Aren't you at all curious?
Why do you want to run from something you don't yet understand?
I know what you are.
I know what you're doing.
All those women.
What is it you think I don't understand?
Well, if you knew the truth, you wouldn't be afraid.
You would be amazed.
Are you willing to learn?
This is the mommy, this is the daddy, and this is the baby.
What's Mommy doing?
Is she sleeping?
No, she's dead.
Help me.
Help me.
- Get away from her.
- Stop.
You understand now.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- His loss?
What about our loss?
What about those dead women?
It was never our intent to harm you.
So much for good intentions.
- Molly, let's get out of here.
- Wait.
Can I show you something?
Please?
This is the one that I like, so if you could get that...
Anna.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Is there a problem?
Uh, no, the upload's complete.
The Humanichs are under way.
Well, then I would say we deserve a drink.
Uh, I don't want a drink.
I want answers.
About John's death.
What are you talking about?
After he left Humanichs that night,
I called you and you told me not to worry and that you would handle it.
And... 20 minutes later, he was dead.
Are you accusing me of murder?
Just tell me you didn't do it.
- That we didn't do it.
- Julie, that was an accident.
- A very convenient one.
- But still it was an accident.
Our hands are clean.
So stop with your conspiracy theories and get back to work.
Accusations like that can have repercussions.
So what is this?
It's a memorial.
To commemorate every human life sacrificed to save us.
We didn't understand impregnating humans would cause their death.
We're not here to kill, we're here to survive.
To rebuild.
Sometimes "sorry" isn't enough, and this is one of those times.
We agree.
The deaths are unforgivable.
But we have managed to evolve.
Evolve?
How?
We procreate without causing harm to humans.
Hybrid births no longer kill the mothers.
That's why there hasn't been any more reported deaths.
Molly, we don't know that that's true.
We don't know what they want.
We want to coexist.
Peacefully.
I told you you'd have to make a choice.
Now is that time.
You can't be serious, Molly.
They're people, for God's sakes.
Peaceful people.
We can't let the GSC unleash a virus.
- That's genocide.
- Okay, so... so the hybrids live, and then what?
We learn to coexist.
What did he do to you?
What did he show you?
- Their history.
- What about it?
They were a peaceful society on their planet, threatened with extinction by a virus.
Now, the spores were sent out to try to find a suitable host.
That's when they found me, on the Seraphim.
Molly...
They can mess with your head, your perception.
How do you know what he's telling you is true?
- Because I'm one of them.
- No, you're not.
- Yes!
You saw the triple helix.
- No!
You are infected with their DNA.
Come on.
We got what we came for.
We got Ahdu's DNA.
Now let's get out of here and take that back to the lab.
No.
What I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna explain this to Shepherd.
- You're officially certifiable.
- Look.
Healed.
I heal faster.
I think faster.
What we're dealing with here, JD, is evolution.
Survival of the fittest.
Now, what we ought to be doing is studying them, not trying to kill 'em!
No, we are talking about aliens here, Molly.
- Who are part human.
- And part not!
I don't think you understand how dangerous this all is.
I'm sorry, JD.
But I cannot be a part of slaughtering innocent children with a virus I created.
Now, if you do nothing and I do nothing, they are all gonna die.
Me included.
What do you say we go get some pizza on our way home?
Sure, if you want.
Why can't Lucy come with us?
Because I hardly ever see you and you like pizza.
Lucy likes pizza, too.
- Floor, please.
- P2 parking, please.
Thank you, Otis.
- Otis, why are we going up?
- We are not going up, Julie.
Yes, we are.
We're going in the wrong direction, Otis.
Stop.
Stop, Otis!
That was weird.
Hold on, hold on!
Emergency override!
Stop!
Stop the elevator!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop, stop!
Have a good evening, Julie, and a safe ride home.
- Are you okay?
- Sure.
These are African elephants.
Want to know why?
Because the mom and dad...
So what do you think?
I think we've found our new leader.
It's time for you and I to have a little chat.
How the hell did you get in here?
This gun says I don't answer questions.
Ah.
You looking for this?
Oh, yeah, I dismantled your little panic button.
Cool feature, very high-tech.
So where are we going?
How about you just drive.
My son was so strong.
So happy.
I thought he was a gift from God.
But a full-term baby after just a two-month pregnancy?
You must have known that wasn't normal.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
You're undocumented.
Then what happened?
He just grew so fast.
Before I knew it, he was walking.
Talking.
One day...
I saw him standing in front of the sliding door... staring out the window at nothing.
He said, "mommy..."
they're calling me.
I have to go.
- And then he was gone.
- Who was calling him?
The devil.
Sit.
Hello, Toby.
Do you have any idea the position you just put me in?
Put yourselves in?
Not so great being in the hot seat, is it?
- This is an abduction.
- No, it's not.
It's a negotiation.
- You're really stoked about this, huh?
- Yeah.
Once they wake up, my family's going to be even bigger.
- Your family?
- Yeah.
Lucy's my sister, so that makes all these new Humanichs my brothers and sisters.
- So what does that make me?
- My BHF.
- Your what?
- My Best Human Friend.
You never lied to me or reprogrammed me.
Or left me.
And I never will.
You're my BHF.
My Best Humanich Friend.
I love you, bud.
Lucy!
I've been released from diagnostics.
They said you were going online.
Can I see?
Yeah, sure.
We're just about to fire this guy up.
Man, it's too bad Julie's in D.C.
- She's missing the fruits of her labor.
- And you're missing her.
We're not talking about me, we're talking about this guy.
He doesn't have a name?
No, not yet.
You want to do the honors?
♪ ♪
Lucas.
His name is Lucas.
All right.
Let's do this thing.
Hi, Charlie.
Lucy.
Ethan.
Hello, Lucas.
What exactly are you proposing here?
Peace.
Coexistence.
Coexistence with the hybrids means the end of the human race.
- Extinction.
- Maybe not.
Maybe... it's just a new beginning.
We haven't even thought of the possibilities.
What possibilities?
They're smarter than us.
They heal faster.
Their DNA just might contain a medical magic bullet.
They control your thoughts, make you do whatever they damn well please.
Now, we can talk pros and cons all day long, Molly,
- they're still a threat.
- They're not killing women anymore.
- They've evolved.
- Yeah.
They've gone underground, somewhere.
And obviously you know where.
Toby, come on.
They're half human, for God's sakes.
There's women, there's children.
Can you expand your mind for just two seconds?
Damn it, Molly!
What'd you expect me to do?
Huh?
There is no universe... where this makes sense to anybody except you.
Bup-bup-bup.
Sit back down, General.
Nobody said you could get up.
Okay.
Look, Toby.
All I'm asking you to do is broker... some sort of peace conference.
You can see for yourselves who they are before you unleash a virus that will destroy them.
That's got to be better than genocide.
Toby, please.
You made me lie to Congress.
What if I told them the truth?
That you knew about this so-called invasion... but you kept it hidden.
Your word against mine.
I'd pass that BMI polygraph in two seconds.
You would be discredited.
Lose your stripes, your honor.
Everything.
How do I get in touch with you?
You have 24 hours to talk to your people.
Then we'll be in touch.
- Toby, where the hell have you been?
- We need to assemble the team.
First there is something you need to see.
Can you tell me what you told the nurse?
What is happening to you?
My hair and fingernails... they're growing so fast.
I hear strange voices in my head that won't stop telling me to do shameful things.
Do you believe that my son is a demon?
Is he a demon?
Tell me!
- Who is she?
- Mei Fong.
Illegal.
Nate's with her in the Faraday Unit now.
He's running a CMP, a whole-exome sequence,
- and a marrow extract.
- Good.
We need to find out exactly what happened to her.
What are we doing here?
We are picking up stuff for a rainy day.
Open the damn door.
- Welcome back, Mr. Richter.
- "Open the damn door"?
- That's your password?
- Easy to remember.
Okay, we got to grab night kits, H2O extractors, and solar bundles.
You really think we need all this stuff?
Tobias Shepherd is capable of just about anything.
And I am prepared for...
just about anything.
He's not evil, JD.
He's...
- he's just complicated.
- Complicated?
That's the word you use to describe him?
Complicated.
Dr. Woods believes the hybrids have evolved... that they no longer pose an immediate threat.
She's asked for a détente.
For us to sit down with her son... and find a way to coexist in peace.
There will be no détente.
I'm not gonna be the man who presided over a mass extinction.
We have the virus.
We have the Humanichs.
- This ends now.
- What about Dr. Woods?
Dr. Woods has chosen her side.
She stands with the enemy.
We'll treat her like the enemy.
How do you know we're not being tracked?
The jeep is untrackable by satellite, thanks to a few contraptions my buddy Ray made for me.
Okay, look,
I know we're not on a major highway, but... have you noticed that for the past few miles we've seen nobody?
No cars, no people... nothing.
Yeah.
I noticed.
Where is everybody?
With shocking news that affects the entire region.
There is an at-large terrorist cell in our midst bearing biological weapons.
This Red-Level emergency lockdown will remain in place for 72 hours.
The alleged terrorists have been identified as former astronaut and GSC employee Dr. Molly Woods and disgraced Second Kuwait War veteran
- James Daniel Richter...
- So he destroyed our credibility... before we could destroy his.
Your "complicated" friend... just made us the most wanted people in the world.
Do you remember Paris?
I remember climbing the Eiffel Tower and running down the Champs-Élysées.
- It was raining, but...
- There was a nice old lady.
- And she gave me her umbrella.
- It had a hole in it.
I was soaked.
So you have all the same memories?
Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.
- They all do.
- Our memories were installed.
We didn't have the luxury of learning by experience, like you.
But I want to have memories with both of you, too.
Okay.
Well... let's make some right now.
Just the three of us.
Charlie, will you take a picture of us with my Pyxis Cube?
Yeah.
What's that?
It's a place where people keep their most important memories.
Kind of like an old-school photo album, if you're into that sort of stuff.
_
Lucy, turn around, smile.
Sorry.
Let's do it.
Everybody say "cheese and crackers."
What's going on?
What's going on is, we are in a security lockdown.
What does that mean?
It means we're not going anywhere for the moment.
Shepherd betrayed us.
He's looking for you.
And us, too.
- We're gonna have to stay in hiding.
- We don't want to hide.
We want to live and go about in the world freely.
Well, I don't want to be the person to break the news to you, but you are a long way from that.
We all are at this point.
Okay, look, JD has supplies and food.
He's ex-military, so he can help with defense.
I can at least help you secure the perimeter.
Mm-mm, no.
We're not taking orders from one of them.
I'm sorry, who the hell are you?
This is Ares.
JD.
Molly.
Hey, new guy, I laid my ass on the line for you people.
- "You people."
- Our mother trusts him.
Your mother... doesn't know which side she's on.
Okay, look, this isn't about sides.
It's about survival.
For all of us.
We won't survive here.
We should leave now.
Scatter into the cities, propagate until the odds are in our favor,
- then let the humans decide...
- Decide what?
If they want to live in our world... or die in theirs.
I thought you wanted peace.
It takes two sides for peace, doesn't it?
All right, there is a five-county lockdown in place.
Anybody who leaves here, they will be hunted down, captured and killed.
And if we stay here, we're sitting ducks.
Yeah.
But they don't know where the ducks are sitting.
Now, the GSC has a virus... that can kill all of us.
The streets are empty right now.
One person leaves this compound, just one... it's gonna lead the GSC right back to us.
If we wait out the lockdown, it'll make it easier for us to disperse.
It's only 72 hours.
Now, we will stay here until then, help JD secure the grounds.
If that's your decision, brother.
Molly!
- Terra.
- You came back.
Of course.
- Hey.
- Oh.
Hey there.
Find out how long we'll be here?
Um...
I just got a special security clearance.
- We are going home tonight.
- That's good.
Uh, Ethan asked if Lucas and I could spend the night with you guys.
- I told him it was up to you.
- No.
Lucas isn't ready.
We have to power him down here.
Okay.
Well, what about me?
I think with Julie in Washington, he gets lonely.
- And you must, too.
- Me?
No, I'm fine.
But, uh... yeah, for Ethan?
Sure.
Why not?
Charlie...
I found your checklist for Humanichs.
What's an expiration date?
You're not supposed to be snooping...
I wasn't snooping.
I was looking.
John Woods made it very clear that he wanted Humanichs to have the human experience, so he built in a program for them to expire.
You mean... die.
I mean... humans die.
It's just part of the deal.
It sort of defines us.
To make Humanichs more human, it just seemed logical to build in... a termination point.
It's not logical to me.
Humans have to die, we don't.
If you want us to be more like you, then give us the same rights.
Let us really live before we die.
Look, I'm so sorry you had to find out that way.
I know it's a lot to absorb.
You're responding like any human would.
Because I'm more human than you think, Charlie.
I wish you understood that.
Believe it or not, Mei Fong's DNA has somehow... been converted to a triple helix.
So you're saying, conclusively, that this woman is a hybrid?
She will be.
Soon.
A casualty of microchimerism.
We think there was a placental transfer of alien fetal cells during the pregnancy.
Does this happen to every woman who survives a hybrid pregnancy?
I don't know.
Mei has a rare genetic marker called the "Kilimanjaro Allele".
It might be why she's changing and others aren't.
Run that marker through our employee database.
Only one person with that same anomaly.
Molly Woods.
Can you stop the progression in this woman?
Maybe, with a full plasma and marrow transplant, but...
- it could kill her.
- Do it.
We need her consent.
With all due respect, she has rights.
Mei Fong is now an enemy of the state.
Consent is not required.
You have your orders.
We thought Molly Woods was on the other side.
It turns out she is the other side.
- Where are you going?
- To see Taylor.
Don't you think it's about time I met him?
When Taylor thinks it's necessary, he'll let me know.
I figure we might want to get one or two of these things running.
- What?
- Why are you doing this?
You know, when I was a kid, my dad and I, we used to take old cars and work on them...
I'm... not talking about the engines.
I'm an enemy of the state now, Molly.
Not a lot of options.
You could just dump all this stuff off and leave.
I'm not a deserter.
- I'm not saying that you are.
- Molly.

With schools, banks and business districts still shuttered, there is outrage over the disruption of everyday lives.
With public pressure mounting to end this lockdown, there is still no word on the whereabouts of former astronaut Molly Woods and her accomplice, disgraced war veteran JD Richter.
They're fighting this thing like a war.
But it's not a war, it's a scourge.
We're running out of time.
- We need to get personal.
- Meaning?
Everyone has their Achilles' heel.
- What do they want?
- Even JD Richter.
With this lockdown due to end in 24 hours, will the GSC dare to extend it and risk rioting in the streets?
And in another twist, Kelsey Richter, daughter of suspected terrorist JD Richter and circuit court judge Dorothy Richter, was taken into custody today...
- What the hell?
- under the Loyalty Act.
So the seven beautiful sisters were playing in the meadow, and then along came... a hunter... named Orion.
And Orion wanted the sisters all to himself, so he chased them to the ends of the earth.
But just when he thought he had them trapped, the most powerful god in the universe,
Zeus... came along to rescue them.
You came to rescue us from the hunters.

I thought by now you'd have some intel on where the hybrids might be hiding.
So did I, General.
But to my surprise, initial sat-scans came up negative.
- So, what, we have nothing?
- Not yet.
But I am currently exploring a new theory.
- I'm listening.
- In order to find life, perhaps we should be looking for the absence of it.
Meaning?
If the hybrids could emit an EMP powerful enough, they could create a thermal hole in my sat-scans.
- A blind spot.
- Precisely.
Which would allow them to hide in plain sight.
What am I looking at?
Osgood Listening Station.
Closed in 2025 due to defense budget cuts.
This is an old satellite image of the area.
This was shot this morning.
Something is blocking my scans, something that wasn't there six months ago.
Gated... tunnel systems, easily defendable...
Well, this has to be it.
What's your recommendation?
Release the virus in conjunction with the deployment of the Humanichs army.
And if we withheld release of the virus?
In 6.5 months, the Homo sapiens genome will be diluted to the point that an extinction event is inevitable.

"How would you like a nice Hawaiian punch?
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!"
That last one was you.
Okay, look...
I like the shirt.
But, honestly, you have no one but yourself to blame.
You made your flannel bed, and now you got to lie in it.
What, am I so rigid and predictable that if I put a different shirt on one day, it becomes a whole thing?
Uh, yeah.
[Chuckles] Come on.
If Fred Flintstone starts walking around Bedrock in something other than his leopard man-dress, you don't think that Wilma and Barney and Betty aren't gonna give him crap?
Can we just drop this?
Yeah.
I'm fine dropping it.
Consider it dropped.
The thing is, when a guy wears a Hawaiian shirt, people expect a certain lightness of spirit that you...
I'm just gonna say it...
lack.
It's okay.
We don't expect it from you.
You have other qualities.
You're very tall.
You intimidate servicepeople.
It didn't help us tonight, but whatever.
Personally, I like Hawaiian Mike.
I just want to understand Hawaiian Mike.
Walk me through the process.
You're going through your shirts...
Plaid, plaid, plaid, plaid, plaid...
Hawaiian!
I got to ask...
It's been hanging in your closet for years.
Why today?
Look, I'm not gonna walk you through the process 'cause there is no process.
I looked in the closet.
I thought the shirt might be fun...
Boy, was I wrong about that... and I put it on.
But don't worry, 'cause I'm never gonna wear the stupid thing again.
Now, why would you say that?
Sue:
Devin!
Devin!
Hey, wait, wait!
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
Look, I might have said some things the other day that are not true, and I was just talking, and they do not reflect Axl's thinking in any way.
Sue, what's going on?
What's going on is I am setting the record straight.
And when you have something really important to say, there is no better way to do it than through song.
And I brought some of my friends from my new no-cut a cappella club to help me.

Wow.
Well, that's...
Thank you.
I guess.
[Sighs]
- Hey, Nancy.
- Hi, Frankie.
Look, I-I was just wondering if, you know, everything's okay between us.
Uh, yeah.
Everything's fine.
I know you had a luau and didn't invite us.
Wait, what?
I saw Mike in the Hawaiian shirt.
[Laughs] Oh, that.
Is this because of the murder-mystery party we had?
Because that was small.
Just people from Ron's work, and the Norwoods.
Okay, Nancy, I can assure you we did not have a luau.
And just so you know, we went out with the Norwoods, too.
Paula called me special.
Anyway, for whatever reason, out of nowhere,
Mike decided he wanted to wear a Hawaiian shirt.
Oh.
Yep.
Ron went through this, too.
What do you mean?
Well, when men get to a certain age, they suddenly want to do something different.
With Ron, it was taking karate and ordering thin-crust pizza.
It's like I was living with a stranger.
Anyway, it's a midlife crisis.
Or, as Dr. Oz likes to call it, "man-opause."
They all go through it.
What?
No, no.
Not Mike.
He hates different.
Besides, it was just the one shirt, and he's not even wearing it anymore.
I am just glad that you and I are okay.
Whew!
That is a weight off.
No, we're fine.
Like I would ever have a party without you.
You bring all the good food!
[Laughs] Frankie.
Well, I got to run.
Ron has an exhibition at the dojo.
He's never gonna beat that 12-year-old.
Her hands are like lightning from being in that wheelchair.

All right!
Come and get it!
You guys want to eat pizza, you got to do it out here!
You abused your privileges, getting into the nutter butters!
You're outside ants now.
[Sighs]
Oh.
Hey.
I'm just sitting here eating three-day-old pizza and talking to ants.
See what you've been missing?
I saw Sue.
She was with her a cappella group.
And they sang a song to me about us.
Oh.
Good.
And here I was worried she'd make it worse.
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't know.
I guess I freaked out and I was kind of probably a jerk about it and didn't give you a chance to talk.
So, you know, we should talk.
Uh, here's the thing.
I don't know what Sue said to you, or apparently sang to you, but I didn't think what we were doing here was super serious.
I'm not ready to get married.
I mean, this is college.
I'm not thinking ahead.
Yes, exactly.
It's college.
I mean, I don't want to get serious, either.
This is supposed to be about you and me hanging out and having fun.
Exactly.
That's all I ever wanted.
Really?
So we're on the same page?
Completely. [Chuckles]
As we always have been.
So, let's just go back to that with a new additional rule of not listening to anything Sue says again, ever.
- Hmm?
- Cool.
All right.
Although...
College is supposed to be the best time of our lives, and we wouldn't want to look back and think we didn't have all the fun we could have.
[Sighs]
What are you saying?
Well, um, I'm just saying...
Do you ever think about all the hot girls on this campus?
Would I get in trouble if I said yes?
No!
It's like, when are we ever gonna be presented with this many hot guys and girls our age ever again?
So, you're saying we should see other people?
Maybe.
But we should also still see each other, too.
- Does that sound weird?
- No, that sounds awesome.
Are you sure you're not a guy?
I just want us to see each other, see other people, and definitely watch football together every Sunday.
I swear to God, if I didn't want to marry you, I would marry you.
Ah!

Randy Poteat on Youtube says,
"y'all got to do it right the first time, or you'll be back at it in 10 years."
Randy Poteat.
All I asked was for you to clean the bathroom!
How hard is that?
Well, if you want to do it properly, you have to get to the root of the problem.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Brick.
We are not "root of the problem" people.
The surface is where we live.
You start chipping away and digging down to the root of everything, the whole place falls apart.
The filth and grime is what's holding everything together.
You want to see a video of how we fix things?
We wipe, we slide, we shove, we close.
If a drawer is too full to open, move on to the next one.
Never open it again.
That would have been critical information to have before I started.
I know, Brick.
I'm sorry.
With Sue away at college and your Dad's shirt,
I've been distracted, and I've let some things slide...
Mainly, you.
But things are gonna be back to normal now, I promise.

I don't care.
I always wanted one of these things.
[Sighs] It's gonna be fun.
Gonna get some rags and clean this baby up.
Hold on.
I-I don't get it.
In 22, 23... whatever years of marriage, you have never once said anything about a motorcycle.
I don't know.
I guess I just wanted something different.
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Cellphone vibrates]
Hey, Sue.
I just can't do this many clubs.
I mean, I-I-I got to figure out a way to quit some.
I think I over-clubbed, Brick.
I totally get why there are cuts in high school now.
I have grown up so much in two weeks.
Axl:
Sue, there are more important things to talk about than your stupid clubs.
Dad bought a motorcycle.
That's a cool thing to do.
I'm telling you, be careful.
Dad is not Dad.
Brick:
You're right.
Things are weird here.
Ever since you left, I don't know,
I think maybe you guys are the filth that holds this family together.
Aww.
It's true, though.
You know, I was cleaning the bathroom this week...
- Cleaning?
- And decided to go on Youtube to help me out with everything.
[Indistinct conversation]
Everybody has their own idea of paradise, but for Sue Heck, it's...
You can sign up for anything?
Hi.
Now, what if I join your club and I don't exactly have any tap experience?
I once did a shuffle off to Buffalo in a skit about the food pyramid.
I-I was broccoli.
But that's about it.
No problem.
You don't need any experience.
Just sign up.
Okay, okay, okay.
And when are they making cuts?
Should a person expect a text, e-mail, phone call?
- There are no cuts.
- What?
Yeah, no cuts.
It's just about having fun.
Oh.
Ahh.
- Hi, what do you guys do?
- We're working to save polar bears.
I love polar bears!
And saving things.
Origami!
So, want to come over later and do nothing?
I don't know.
How is your ant problem?
We seem to have reached a happy agreement.
Whenever I have pizza,
I throw them a slice in the corner.
Seems to appease 'em.
Wow, I never thought I'd see peace with the ants in my lifetime.
Oh.
Well, anyway, I got to get to practice.
Coach put me in for almost a full minute on Saturday.
Wouldn't look good if a star player showed up late.
You know, got to set a good example.
Think we should stop her?
Nah.
Let her wear herself out.
She'll sleep better.
Hey.
Oh, my God, did you know there is a whole club just for tasting cheese?
I mean, I always thought there were only two kinds...
Regular and squeezy.
Anyway...
Thanks for coming with me.
My roommate said this was lame, but clearly her lame-dar is way off, because this is so not lame.
"Jelly is my Jam" Club!
Ooh.
What are you doing?
I'm signing Axl up for the Renaissance Society.
Think he'll be mad at me?
What?
Uh, no way.
You could do anything and he wouldn't get mad at you.
Uh, he is head over heels for you.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.
No, trust me.
I am his sister.
I have never seen him like this before.
I mean, he loves you.
Did he actually say that?
Yeah, pretty much.
I mean, I get you guys are only in college, but think about it...
Someday you and I could be sisters-in-law.
How awesome would that be?
Candle-making?
I have prior candle-making experience.
All right, turn on the microwave.
No, phone's still crackling.
Turn it off.
Uh-huh.
I figured it out.
What we have here is a crackly phone.
We've got to fix this, Mike.
Paula Norwood called and invited us to dinner Friday night, and I could barely hear what she said.
Oh, no.
They don't want to drag us to that crepe place, do they?
- I don't like sauce.
- I don't know.
All I know is it's 7:30 at "kck-kck-kck-kck-kck."
Don't worry.
I'm gonna try to talk Paula into going to that new place next to the teddy bear hospital.
I have coupons for that.
Just to be safe, I'll eat before we go.
May I speak to the both of you?
Looks like you're already doing it.
It has come to my attention that with Axl and Sue gone,
I'm the only one left doing the chores.
Hmm, whose turn is it to empty the dishwasher?
Oh, look, it's me.
Whose turn is it to take out the trash?
Well, since Sue's not here, I guess it's me.
Who's next in line to vacuum?
Let me eliminate the suspense.
It's me.
So, to remedy this obvious injustice,
I've taken the Liberty of creating a new chore chart.
As you can see, I divided all the labor up equally.
It's time you two start pulling your weight around here and sharing in the chores.
We do plenty of chores, Brick.
It's called our life.
- This conversation's a chore.
- The bathroom is really gross.
So, Dad, can I put you down for Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Uh, put me down for "no days" and "no days."
Well, that's gonna put a lot of extra work on Mom, but okay.
Look, Brick, you're the one using the bathroom, so you're the one that's gonna clean it.
Now, just get some cleaning supplies from the laundry room and get on it.
I'm beginning to think you only had children because you wanted slaves.
No, we had them 'cause of beer.
Mike, where did I put the coupons?
You didn't take 'em, did you?
You're always taking my stuff.
Unless it's for tires, I didn't take 'em.
Well, I know I put 'em somewh...
Well, hey, there, Hawkeye.
Where's Trapper John?
What?
I don't know.
I-I have never seen you wear a Hawaiian shirt.
Are your 400 flannels in the wash?
Ah, the kids gave me this years ago.
I saw it in the closet and said, "what the hey?"
You're wearing a Hawaiian shirt and saying "what the hey?"
Who are you?
I've worn other shirts before.
It's not a big deal.
Now, what's the difference between extra strength and super...
Whoa.
Dad, I can see your elbows.
I know.
I don't believe it, either.
It's your Dad's head, but it's like it's on another body.
Mind blown.
Relax.
It's a shirt, people.
I've got to show this to Axl and Sue.
Oh, my God.
Let me see, let me see.
What is happening?
Why is Dad wearing that shirt?
I don't know.
Is it Hawaiian day at the quarry?
Are Mom and Dad going to a costume party?
Yeah, like your Dad would ever wear a costume to a costume party.
Maybe his vision's going and he no longer sees pattern.
Okay, let's everyone stop worrying about me so much and start worrying about this library book I just found.
We paid 30 bucks for this.
Got to look first, people.
Hi, Axl.
Okay, I know what's going on here.
We just studied this.
It's classic identity disorder.
Dad's mind has him convinced he's someone else in order to cope with his sucky life.
Axl, can you hear me?
Do you believe it?
Dad's actually wearing the Hawaiian shirt we got him!
I know, but why?
Does he know he's wearing it?
Was he asleep, and they just put it on him?
I don't know.
Oh, and guess what.
He's going outside in it.
Oh, my God.
Hey, hey, hey.
Be happy he's wearing something different.
Let's not get on him.
He's like a deer in the yard.
We don't want to scare him away.
Hey!
I found the coupons.
Let's blow this popsicle stand!
What?
I say that all the time.
Hey.
Check out this picture of my Dad in a Hawaiian shirt.
Axl, I think we should break up.
He doesn't have to wear it all the time.
Wait, are you serious?
Sue.
Hey, Axl.
Check me out.
I am tumbling rocks for my Geology Club and getting my broom ready for Muggle Quidditch.
I haven't figured out how to work homework into all my club activities, but luckily, I'm in homework club!
Devin broke up with me.
What?
Yeah.
Apparently she had a long conversation with someone like my dork sister, and it totally freaked her out.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.
She thinks we're moving too fast.
What the hell did you say to her, Sue?
!
I did...
I-I don't...
I don't know...
I mean, I-I don't know.
I-I-I said that you loved her, 'cause, I mean, you do.
And it would be really cool if you guys got married someday.
Married?
!
No, no, no.
That's not what I meant.
I-I-I mean, not now.
Not now.
Just, like, someday, you know?
'Cause you guys are...
Mm!
I knew if you came to my college, you would ruin my life!
And I've been so good to you!
I took you out for pizza!
I nodded at you in the quad, twice!
I saw you wipe out in the union.
I didn't laugh or draw attention or anything!
I am so, so sorry, Axl.
I thought I was helping.
If I'm the one who broke you two up, I will never forgive myself.
Okay, you know what?
That's it.
We're going back to the old rules.
You don't know me, and I don't know you, all right?
No saying hi.
No waving at me across campus.
150-foot radius around me at all times.
If you see me coming, you lay in a ditch until I pass!
We are done!
One.
Two.
Three.
- Hey, there!
Hello.
- Hey, guys.
Hi!
Hey, Hawkeye.
Where's Trapper John?
I already used that one.
What about Tom Selleck?
Have you done that?
I knew I was forgetting one.
So, you about to crack the big case, there, Magnum?
That's big talk from a guy who likes crepes.
Okay, you need to get over your fear of sauce, man.
Never.
Okay, so, listen.
I have two coupons, but the thing is, you can only use one per table.
So, here's the plan.
We're gonna pretend like we were sitting separately and we just ran into each other, and so now we're combining our two tables.
Okay, don't let Bill say anything, 'cause he's never good at this stuff.
What do you mean I'm never good at this stuff?
I'm great at this stuff.
Hi.
How's everybody doing tonight?
- Hi.
- Good.
Thank you.
So, listen, we were sitting separately, but now we're gonna sit with our friends, who we just ran into, but you should consider it two separate tables for anything that might happen later.
Yep, yep.
Separate tables.
'Cause we came here by ourselves and then just happened to run into these good people right here.
There was no prior communication, even with all the devices that are available today.
I don't even have an iPad.
I don't even know why you would even need one.
And an iPhone?
Well, I think that's just kind of a waste of money, if you ask me.
Not that we're the kind of people that are pinching pennies, 'cause we're doing great.
Hey, can we please get that bread basket?
Remind me... we need to play poker.
Okay, so does everybody know what they want?
Ooh!
I might order a piña colada.
Ooh.
Do you like piña coladas, Mike?
Getting caught in the rain?
Ah, yeah.
You know, there are about a million other things in the world we could be talking about.
Football, baseball, tennis, if you're desperate, which I am.
Right, right, right.
Okay.
Well, you got the Colts.
You know, got that new running back.
So it should really be a good year.
I think...
I'm sorry.
I can't think of anything but the shirt.
Hey, come on.
We really should give Mike a break.
We'll do four more minutes on the shirt, then we'll move on.
So, after 3,000 flushes with no results,
Brick turned to where every kid goes when he needs guidance...
YouTube.
Hey, y'all.
I'm Randy Poteat of Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and I'm gonna show you how to properly clean a bathroom.
Randy, dinner!
I'm making another video for the YouTube!
Uh-oh.
This here is mildew, the enemy of every bathroom.
While cleaning, you may discover loose grout.
Loose or flaking grout must be replaced.
Ignoring this step could lead to... black mold.
To learn more about replacing grout, go to lesson three.
While removing this grout, you may identify some loose tiles.
Uh-oh.
To repair loose tiles, go to lesson four.
I'm sorry... those were legitimate coupons.
They should have honored them.
We could have been sitting at separate tables.
They don't know.
I'm telling you... it's Bill who blew it.
He shouldn't have jumped in.
I had this thing.
We were golden.
You know, people who have no community-theater experience should just leave this kind of stuff to the professionals.
He owes us 10 bucks.
What is up with you?
Nothing's up.
You've been pissy since the breadsticks.
I'm not pissy.
It was a lot more than four minutes on the shirt.
That's all.
Oh, come on.
You're exaggerating.
"Hey, Don Ho, how about a chorus of 'Tiny Bubbles'?
Ha, ha, ha."
"How much to ride the paddleboard?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
"How would you like a nice Hawaiian punch?
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!"
That last one was you.
Okay, look...
I like the shirt.
But, honestly, you have no one but yourself to blame.
You made your flannel bed, and now you got to lie in it.
What, am I so rigid and predictable that if I put a different shirt on one day, it becomes a whole thing?
Uh, yeah.
Come on.
If Fred Flintstone starts walking around Bedrock in something other than his leopard man-dress, you don't think that Wilma and Barney and Betty aren't gonna give him crap?

You sure you got this?
Yeah, we got it.
Thanks.
The younger ones, I can't, you know?
Partner's a class act.
You look like shit.
He brought it back.
I was up all night... just sitting there with my gun...
hoping he'd come again.
Pass this clusterfuck back to Golden.
Well, hey.
Let's go to that asshole's club and find Calista.
Hey...
I got him on breaking and entering.
- You wanna see a dead body?
- No!
I want to find Calista and bust Royalle.
Come!
Take a look.
Shit.
That's the kid who was with Zora.
I didn't think he was a flier.
He has a registered powers profile.
"Levitation Boy.
Maurice St. Clair.
Max vertical lift is three feet.
No propulsion."
For his body to do this much damage and still remain intact, he couldn't have reached terminal velocity.
He must have been falling for five, six seconds, so that's, maybe, 500 feet.
He dropped from a plane?
No.
This is Class B airspace.
Even the smallest planes have to fly between 6 and 10 thousand feet.
Look at the big brain on you.
When I first started flying, I used to crash all the time.
Only got a handle on it after I...
got my pilot's license.
Just because you can, doesn't mean you know how.
He came at an angle.
From there.
Anything?
I'm wondering where Calista might be going next.
What other fucked up shit she might try to get powers.
Is this a hangout for the Powerz Kidz?
No.
No, it's not central enough for them.
So, they probably wouldn't make a habit of coming up here to party, get high...
I'll come back later.
It's okay.
I know you don't think about girls that way.
I mean, you and Simons are a thing, right?
Simons' sexuality...
defies... categorization.
I'm not that modest.
Modesty is an unappreciated virtue these days.
Okay.
Unexpected beauty is a nearly sacred thing.
A revelation changes you by the act of noticing it.
Hold something of yourself in reserve.
The promise of revelation.
Do you think the cops are still looking for me?
And you going somewhere?
Do I need permission?
You can go wherever you want, but yes, the police are still looking for you.
You have no idea what it feels like to be trapped.
How do you think I discovered my power?
I spent a long time... wishing I could get away from what my life was like.
And then...
You made your escape from the police, you even eluded Retro Girl, but..
still I wonder...
What?
I keep thinking of you, hiding, listening to Retro Girl as she betrayed you.
But you still admire her, don't you?
She's still Retro Girl.
No.
She's not.
Retro Girl is not a person.
She is the overexposed image that's been sold to you.
She's a lie, Calista.
And until you free yourself from that trap, she will keep on hurting you.
Retro Girl is lonely and vulgar, but she is vastly powerful.
And you are not the only one who'll get hurt.
Who would have known Zora would have been juiced up like this?
Par?
What is she, like, 20?
Well, she must have something real or they wouldn't bother.
So, back when this guy was the keynote at our annual retreat, and Richard made it my job to make sure that he got there on time.
So I finally tracked him down at the Hotel La Chapelle, where he was shacked up with some... very famous actress, and he's hammered.
- You remember this?
- Yeah.
So...
I get him in the costume and into the limo.
We pull in to the "Four Seasons", paparazzi is everywhere, he pulls down the mask, looks at me and pukes all over me.
And you know what he says?
"Sorry, dude.
It was either you or them, and you don't have a camera."
- Well, that was a long time ago.
- Times change.
I mean, here I am.
There you are.
And here these are.
What the fuck?
!
Yeah, looks like your agent doesn't recognize your dead friend.
Okay.
See, when my client tells me some cops are harassing her on the street...
We're just trying to figure out what happened?
...and then, sans Counsel, you make her show you some fucking after hours club...
- It's a murder investigation!
- Don't say a fucking word to them.
Hey, we have a dead kid, she saw him two nights ago.
And you dump this shit on my table?
You used to be an asshole that could fly, now you're just an asshole.
She's a star.
She's a fucking hero, and I won't...
Don't!
... talk!
...
like I'm not!
... here!
Look at me.
But don't see just me.
See the whole room.
Extend your peripheral vision.
You are in control.
Okay?
We weren't a thing.
We made out a few times, but I... really don't know him.
See?
She doesn't know...
The wannabe, Calista, whatever happened between the two of you, she ended the night by jumping off a building.
- Is she...?
- She's alive.
But she's still missing.
We don't want her to end up like this.
Chubb182.
I think Zora is tired.
Just...
look it up.
Chubb182.
Thank you.
Ah...
The flowers.
When did this start?
When the cops came.
After this last awake and aware period,
I pulled out the orbitoclast and he said the same thing.
- Is something wrong?
- The cellular regeneration is the basis of his speed, strength and toughness.
Even his ability to...
consume and absorb biokinetic energy.
We can't turn his powers off.
We can only retard them.
Christian?
Johnny?
By severing his self-awareness.
Is he still in there?
Something is in there.
The power is certainly still in there.
You know, I read his book in high school.
We all read his book.
His book was bullshit.
Let me know if he says anything new at the next awake and aware period.
I thought it was a good book.
Tell her I'm not a criminal!
Are you not a criminal?
You ran from the police.
You said that I could trust you, and then you sold me out to the cops.
No.
I never said that.
I never promised you anything.
I brought you into my home and you lied to me.
And I don't have time for this.
Call Powers Division.
Royalle said that you're dangerous.
That you're gonna hurt me...
and everyone around me.
So, tell me about Royalle.
He's trying to build something.
So what does he want from you?
Why are you with him?
I want powers.
I mean, I have powers, I just haven't...
No one takes me seriously.
That's why I jumped off the building.
Diamond...
Walker... said that that's how he found his powers.
You would have died.
Do you understand that if I hadn't been there,
- you would have died?
- But you've always saved me.
Not you, uh..., my mom.
My dad would lose his shit... over anything.
You never knew what would set him off, but you knew what was coming.
And my mom would flash this Retro Girl tattoo that she had on the back of her hand.
It was like a promise that...
she would keep me safe.
And she did.
She would stand between me and him, and she would take as many punches as she could.
She pretended to be you...
to make herself strong.
I know it... it's crazy.
But I knew that you would save me if I jumped.
The fall killed him.
Also, he has red corkscrews in his DNA.
This stuff again?
Olympia with the exploding heart, the headless Power with the impossible wound, and the flier who can't fly.
All appear to have been taking the same...
Let's... call it a drug...
until we know otherwise.
- What does it do?
- No idea what it does.
We have three dead Powers.
If wannabes decide to try it, my guess is they'll die instantly.
Oh, great.
How soon until we can identify...
Probably never.
I'll do what I can.
- Thank you, Doc.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, it's me, Kaotic Chic, again.
You sure you don't think this is weird?
I'm not stalking you or anything.
It's all good.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Why do you play the game?
I like hurting them.
It makes me feel in control.
Like I'm not weak.
I know that's fucked up.
It's not.
My cousin died when some asshole wrecked a building fighting another asshole who was trying to blow it up.
Makes perfect sense, right?
One got away and one got a movie deal.
No one had to answer for any of it.
No one even knows... what it meant to my family...
or to me.
Somebody should.
Someone should make a statement.
A statement?
Hmm, that's cool.
I know a place.
Wolfe is beginning to remember things.
- What does it mean?
- Nothing, I think.
His brain has to heal daily, forming new connections.
I don't know that his actual thoughts, his memories even exist any longer.
When's the next test?
When I'm ready!
When I feel confident I won't kill anyone else.
We need to get this done.
So let me work.
I gave something to Olympia when I hooked up with him.
This stuff, "Sway".
It's like a powers booster.
Johnny Royalle is using you to pimp out drugs.
- It...
It's not like that.
- Oh, it's exactly like that.
It wasn't even him.
It was this guy, Bug.
Johnny was really mad when he found out.
Don't make excuses for him.
You are being used.
He is exploiting you.
He is offering you something he cannot give you.
You don't need powers in order to be powerful.
Right.
Come, let me show you something.
You're not gonna call the police?
No.
You're under my protection now.
But let me show you how power really works.
First, you have to look the part.
Come on.
Golden got something on that "Chubb182" username.
Guy's name is Larry Gerald.
It's linked to a "Show Us Your Powers" account.
Posted a new video.
Levitation Boy taking off.
Catch me if you can.
He was priming his powers.
"Priming his powers"?
All he could do was hover, nothing badass.
Why do you think he was hanging out with a wannabe like me?
Kidz with legit power think the rest of us are losers.
How did he do it, Larry?
Sway.
Shit cranks the limits.
It's a total boost.
He thought he could do some trick night flying, maybe... get his video to go viral, but... guess he needed to take more.
That's an unregulated powers enhancer.
Who'd he get it from?
You don't tell me, I'm going to assume it was you.
I'm going to ask you again.
Who did he get it from?
The new place, "Here and Gone".
Johnny Royalle?
I...
I don't think so.
I don't know.
Shit.
Where's the rest of it?
Thought that maybe it could, uh..., give me some powers, but... then he fell, I didn't have the balls.
At least you're alive.
Sway.
You know, the kid was holding.
He's a kid.
You wanna... ruin his life for being stupid?
If Royalle is... selling powers enhancers, dropping him down the Shaft gets easy.
Have to make sure you do it the right way.
Probably have to go to his club, see it happen.
But not too close.
Just observational, for fuck's sake.
Observational.
Fuck yeah.
What happens if I kill you?
Nothing.
The deal is the same.
You attack me, the test commences, and clemency is yours.
They shorted one of my eyes.
That's okay.
Just saying I'm not at my best.
Okay.
You can't ride the lightning!
I can't...
I feel...
What do you feel?
I can't feel myself.
million dollar life million dollar life (million dollar life)
we do it with a little bling on it, shine on it got to say super fine on it, if it says, it's mine on it
- Really?
- Yeah!
It's funny.
Can't believe you did an episode of Baywatch.
Yeah.
Shouldn't you be looking out there?
I thought Righteous Thunder never left New York.
Hawking his new energy drink would be my guess.
Did you ever have your own energy drink?
- They weren't a thing in my day.
- Oh.
Sneakers?
- Black Diamonds.
- Ah.
It's in the book, around page 76, I think.
- You think...
- Yeah.
Oh, can I get a pair?
!
The 90s are totally coming back.
Why are we here?
I told you, I'm going to show you how power really works.
Now try not to squint.
Motherfucker.
She fucking lied to us.
Calista's been with her the whole time.
If we go in there, we are the lead story in the Powers That Be.
And Royalle's lawyers rain down shit on the entire division, so...
Listen to me.
- We can go in there, okay?
- Uh-uh.
She is like fucking gravity.
When she goes into a room, everybody is paying attention to her.
- Okay.
- Okay.
We have to be some di-fucking-screet motherfuckers, okay?
No distractions with your personal shit, with, like, your former ex and your bestie.
Okay?
Di-fucking-screet.
Yeah.
Okay.
Welcome to "Here and Gone".
We're honored to have you.
Shit.
God damn it!
I thought you said "di-fucking-screet".
I thought you wanted the fuck inside.
Powers or a face, people..., that's how you get inside.
Hey, schoolboy!
Yeah, you got something.
Come on.
Watch your back.
This way.
She brought Retro Girl.
Create some space for a private chat, please.
Excuse us.
Retro Girl.
Retro...
Retro Girl, I love you!
I love you!
Excuse us.
A little space.
A little more space, please.
Excuse us.
Thank you.
Okay!
Do you see her?
!
Got her.
Or not.
How's it going, man?
All right, dude.
Thanks, baby.
The Kidz are taking Sway!
Hmm!
And the bald creep, creeps, whatever, they're doing the passes.
Royalle's dealing in his own club.
You're trying to make me jealous?
- I was just about to come find you.
- To tell me what?
That you brought Retro Girl to my home?
- What did you tell her?
- I didn't tell her anything.
What does she want here?
She wants to protect me, she wants to show me something.
What does she want to show you?
She wants to show me how real power works.
And you kept talking about how she's so dangerous.
But I'm close to her now.
She won't do anything to hurt me.
And I can protect you..., make sure she leaves you alone.
And if you tell me what you're doing, I could, you know, help you.
Please, don't be mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.
I'll never be mad at you.
But it's time to go to the safe place.
But...
Go to the safe place, Annabel.
We can figure out just cause later.
There's a stash here somewhere.
Unregulated power enhancer, that's a massive bust.
He's not dealing!
He's giving it to them.
There's no money changing hands.
Righteous Thunder, Queen Noir, none of the big Powers are on Sway.
He's giving it to the Kidz.
Fuck!
We need to get Calista.
- Now.
- Yeah.
I'll circle around the top!
All right.
Back door in five.
See you then.
Hey!
See ya.
Other people wanna take a shit and do blow, douchewad!
What the fuck.
This is some uncivilized shit!
Calista?
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Time to go now.
Get off me!
Now, hold up, hold up, hold up!
What the fuck is going on here?
This.
This is what's going on.
That supposed to mean something to me?
It would if you could read.
You know how many lives I've saved?
How many cops I've saved?
Don't flash that crackerjack shit at me.
It's a party, so ease up on the kid.
I got some crackerjack shit for you.
Edwin?
Patty?
Christian-motherfucking-Walker.
I ain't seen you in a minute.
You all right?
Peachy.
- She with you?
- Yeah.
Teach your partner some manners.
Fuck you.
Let it go.
We need to ask her some questions.
Fuck that cop shit, brother!
The kid was with...
Philip when he died, Edwin.
Sad days, man.
Olympia dying in bed;
I ain't going out like that.
Hmm.
There are... worse ways to go.
Ain't the same up there without you, bro.
Ain't the same since you fell.
Appreciate it.
We have to go out the front.
How are you still alive?
I ran away... before Wolfe could kill me.
Much as that seems to have disappointed humanity.
No, I mean, how are you still living with yourself?
How have you not killed yourself yet?
If I'm such a figure of repulsion, why are you here?
Did you come here to what?
Beat me up?
Well, in just the few moments that I've been here..., that's enough for the Twitter-verse to explode:
"Retro Girl visits Johnny Royalle's nightclub."
And the minute I walk out that door, the world will be quivering in anticipation of what I'll say.
And when I tell them:
"Yes, it's a fine place... to bring your mom and dad and do some B-list Power watching", you'll be out of business in a week.
And when that week is over... and nobody's watching you, cares about what you do,
I may come back to beat you up.
- We dodged the bald guy?
- Yeah.
Well, don't worry about them.
Christian.
Detective.
I'm so glad you could come.
Simons informs me someone's broken in through a back door.
Are you here to investigate
- this illegal entry?
- Don't get close to him.
Because, I mean, what other reason would you have for entering a licensed establishment run by a registered Power who has a restraining order against the entire fucking Powers Division?
Calista, come here.
Calista, on the roof...
They can't touch you.
On the roof, I was wrong.
You're not like everybody else.
- You proved that when you jumped.
- They can't take you away.
There's something inside of you that won't give up, won't give in.
Come with us.
Calista, it's time to go.
It's under control, Janice.
Yes, it is because she's coming with me.
I'll go with you.
I love you.
Stop!
... touching me and grabbing me!
You do what you have to do.
But you're on your own.
Fuck this.
You're coming with us!
- We are the police,
- Calista.
okay?
Enough of this.
They can't take you away from your home.
I'm sorry.
It wasn't safe back there.
Where are we?
Where are we?
I'll tell you a story.
Now, you never know, she could've been picked up by a pervert!
Oh yeah, ya... you know everything!
You always do!
I told her Becca's mom couldn't bring me home.
- I kept waiting for her, but...
- Where do you want to go?
Come on.
Where should we go?
There is no place.
I was reading about Bear Island... in the Barents Sea, off Norway.
The beaches have snow instead of sand.
It'd be cold.
Oh, God damn it!
Screw you!
Bear Island is one of the cleanest places on Earth.
Hardly anyone lives there.
They don't even have phones there.
No one could find us.
That's where we should go.
Annabel, get out here!
We're gonna go away from here, Bel.
- Close your eyes.
We're not here.
- I don't want to go away.
I just don't want him to hurt me anymore.
We're gonna go to Bear Island and we're... gonna make snow angels on the beach.
And we're gonna go away.
- If you were here!
...
- What are you doing in here?
!
Huh?
!
Come here!
You can't hide from me!
- Make it stop.
Make it stop.
- Leave her alone!
- Get out of my way!
- Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop...
Annabel?
!
You came back for her, right?
I was 15.
I don't know, but this deserted island..., the night lasts all winter, the winters are long.
I didn't even understand how I got there.
I mean..., I...
I knew I must be a Power, but...
I didn't know how it worked.
I tried, I tried to get back.
But I couldn't, not... not for years.
It was too late.
Is it something that you can fix?
Let's go home, Calista.
I had her.
- I fucking had her.
- I know.
And...
I was doing everything right in there and then I had to go and lose my shit.
You were good in there.
You're a good detective and a good partner.
I need you to hide.
Wait.
What?
No.
You can't leave me here!
Simons will come get you.
They won't think to look for you here.
You... have to trust me.
I don't understand.
There's something I gotta do.
Just...
Just hide.
- Johnny, don't leave me!
- I'll be back.
Hey.
Uh, hey.
Uh, you know how to get out of here?
Uh, yeah, I do.
Yeah, all right.
36 seconds late.
I left her out back.
Go get her.
Can I go home, Johnny?
I want to go home now.
Subtitles: @marlonrock1986 (^^V^^)
Previously on Powers...
It's Olympia.
Whatever was in this envelope was also in his blood stream.
I killed Bug.
This is my signed confession.
- You know her?
- Calista.
Just a Wannabe.
- What do you do?
- I do stuff with light.
- Yeah.
- My name's Zora.
- No, no!
- Why were you on that roof?
Walker, he pushed me.
I caught you falling in the arms of a man with whom I share an incredibly complicated history.
I know she's lying.
I've spent all day listening to her lies and waiting for you to either call or come by.
I left a message.
On the number that I used to...
- The old number.
- I don't use that number anymore.
I had these lucky ties.
Only have one left, and I can't find it.
Your tie, it's askew.
I'm here to register my powers as law...
Can't an old friend pop by?
Blue Magma.
I have an offer of clemency.
They'll never let me out of here.
They will.
If you do something to atone for the people you incinerated.
What's the offer?
An experimental treatment.
What treatment?
Classified.
What do I do?
To participate in the trial, all you have to do is attack me.
Fuck you, Triphammer.
You're not gonna test some new weapon on me.
My weapons and my armor have nothing to do with it.
Ronnie, you wanted to be a hero, but you weren't good at it.
People died.
Now you have a chance to make up for the misery you caused.
All you have to do is take a shot at the guy who put you in here.
That, or spend your life thinking of the kids you killed.
It's gone.
The fire is gone.
You put the fire out.
You put the fire out.
I put the fire out.
Fuck!
Fucking fuck!
You're close, Harley.
Another one.
I killed another one.
What does it feel like?
It doesn't feel like anything to me.
I don't have powers.
But I expect it makes them feel like I feel without my armor.
Helpless.
And then it kills them.
Blue Magma, Ronnie Marquez, he had kids.
I have kids.
You remember what you said to me about them the day you came to me with the idea of the Drainer?
You remember what you said would happen to them if we didn't try to make this a reality?
You said they would all die.
You said 50 years was the most they could hope for.
You came to my home and you pronounced a death sentence on my kids, on every child in the world, within 50 years, if we didn't do this.
I have never once, since that day, allowed myself the liberty of feeling powerless.
Look at you.
The price you've paid to battle monsters.
Are you done with that now?

You know the guy?
- Yeah.
- Mmm.
Fucker just fell out of the sky.
Boom.
Thank fuck no one was inside.
Jesus shit.
My son's not much younger than him.
You sure you got this?
Yeah, we got it.
Thanks.
The younger ones, I can't, you know?
Partner's a class act.
You look like shit.
He brought it back.
I was up all night just sitting there with my gun hoping he'd come again.
- Pass this clusterfuck back to Golden.
- Well, hey.
Let's go to that asshole's club and find Calista.
- Hey...
- I got him on breaking and entering.
- You wanna see a dead body?
- No.
I want to find Calista and bust Royalle.
Come take a look.
Shit.
That's the kid who was with Zora.
I didn't think he was a flier.
He has a registered powers profile.
"Levitation Boy.
Maurice St. Clair.
Max vertical lift is three feet, no propulsion."
For his body to do this much damage and still remain intact, he couldn't have reached terminal velocity.
He must have been falling for five, six seconds.
So that's, maybe, 500 feet.
He dropped from a plane?
No.
This is Class B airspace.
Even the smallest planes have to fly between 6,000 and 10,000 feet.
Look at the big brain on you.
When I first started flying, I used to crash all the time.
Only got a handle on it after I got my pilot's license.
Just because you can, doesn't mean you know how.
He came at an angle.
From there.
Anything?
I'm wondering where Calista might be going next.
What other fucked up shit she might try to get powers.
Is this a hangout for the Powerz Kidz?
No.
No, it's not central enough for them.
So they probably wouldn't make a habit of coming up here to party, get high.
I'll come back later.
It's okay.
I know you don't think about girls that way.
I mean, you and Simons are a thing.
Right?
Simons' sexuality defies categorization.
I'm not that modest.
Modesty is an unappreciated virtue these days.
Okay.
Unexpected beauty is a nearly sacred thing.
A revelation changes you by the act of noticing it.
Hold something of yourself in reserve.
The promise of revelation.
Do you think the cops are still looking for me?
You going somewhere?
Do I need permission?
You can go wherever you want.
But, yes, the police are still looking for you.
You have no idea what it feels like to be trapped.
How do you think I discovered my power?
I spent a long time wishing I could get away from what my life was like.
And then...
You made your escape from the police, you even eluded Retro Girl.
But still I wonder...
What?
I keep thinking of you, hiding, listening to Retro Girl as she betrayed you.
But you still admire her, don't you?
She's still Retro Girl.
No, she's not.
Retro Girl is not a person.
She is the overexposed image that's been sold to you.
She's a lie, Calista.
And until you free yourself from that trap, she will keep on hurting you.
Retro Girl is lonely and vulgar, but she is vastly powerful.
And you are not the only one who'll get hurt.
Who would have known Zora would have been juiced up like this?
PAR?
What is she, like, 20?
Well, she must have something real or they wouldn't bother.
So, back when this guy was the keynote at our annual retreat, and Richard made it my job to make sure that he got there on time.
So I finally tracked him down at the Hotel La Chapelle, where he was shacked up with some very famous actress, and he's hammered.
- You remember this?
- Yeah.
So I get him in the costume and into the limo.
We pull in to the Four Seasons, paparazzi is everywhere, he pulls down the mask, looks at me and pukes all over me.
And you know what he says? "Sorry, dude.
It was either you or them, and you don't have a camera."
- That was a long time ago.
- Times change.
I mean, here I am.
There you are.
And here these are.
What the fuck?
Yeah, looks like your agent doesn't recognize your dead friend.
Okay.
See, when my client tells me some cops are harassing her on the street...
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
... and then sans counsel, you make her show you some fucking after hours club...
It's a murder investigation.
Don't say a fucking word to them.
Hey, we have a dead kid.
She saw him two nights ago.
And you dump this shit on my table?
You used to be an asshole that could fly, now you're just an asshole.
She's a star.
She's a fucking hero, and I won't...
Don't talk like I'm not here!
Look at me, but don't see just me.
See the whole room.
Extend your peripheral vision.
You are in control.
Okay?
We weren't a thing.
We made out a few times, but I really don't know him.
See?
She doesn't know...
The Wannabe, Calista, whatever happened between the two of you, she ended the night by jumping off a building.
- Is she...
- She's alive.
But she's still missing.
We don't want her to end up like this.
Chubb182.
I think Zora is tired.
Just look it up.
Chubb182.
Thank you.
The flowers.
When did this start?
When the cops came.
After this last awake and aware period,
I pulled out the orbitoclast, and he said the same thing.
- Is something wrong?
- The cellular regeneration is the basis of his speed, strength and toughness.
Even his ability to consume and absorb biokinetic energy.
We can't turn his powers off.
We can only retard them.
Christian?
Johnny?
By severing his self-awareness.
Is he still in there?
Something is in there.
The power is certainly still in there.
You know, I read his book in high school.
We all read his book.
His book was bullshit.
Let me know if he says anything new at the next awake and aware period.
I thought it was a good book.
Tell her I'm not a criminal.
Are you not a criminal?
You ran from the police.
You said that I could trust you, and then you sold me out to the cops.
No.
I never said that.
I never promised you anything.
I brought you into my home and you lied to me.
And I don't have time for this.
Call Powers Division.
Royalle said that you're dangerous.
That you're gonna hurt me and everyone around me.
So, tell me about Royalle.
He's trying to build something.
So what does he want from you?
Why are you with him?
I want powers.
I mean, I have powers, I just haven't...
No one takes me seriously.
That's why I jumped off the building.
Diamond...
Walker said that that's how he found his powers.
You would have died.
Do you understand that if I hadn't been there, you would have died?
But you've always saved me.
Not you, um...
My mom.
My dad would lose his shit, over anything.
You never knew what would set him off, but you knew what was coming.
And my mom would flash this Retro Girl tattoo that she had on the back of her hand.
It was like a promise that she would keep me safe.
And she did.
She would stand between me and him, and she would take as many punches as she could.
She pretended to be you to make herself strong.
I know it's crazy, but I knew that you would save me if I jumped.
The fall killed him.
Also, he has red corkscrews in his DNA.
This stuff again?
Olympia with the exploding heart, the headless Power with the impossible wound, and the flier who can't fly.
All appear to have been taking the same, well, let's call it a drug until we know otherwise.
- What does it do?
- I have no idea what it does.
We have three dead Powers.
If Wannabes decide to try it, my guess is they'll die instantly.
Great.
- How soon until we can identify...
- Probably never.
I'll do what I can.
Thank you, Doc.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, it's me, Kaotic Chic, again.
You sure you don't think this is weird?
I'm not stalking you or anything.
It's all good.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Why do you play the game?
I like hurting them.
It makes me feel in control.
Like I'm not weak.
I know that's fucked up.
It's not.
My cousin died when some asshole wrecked a building fighting another asshole who was trying to blow it up.
Makes perfect sense, right?
One got away and one got a movie deal.
No one had to answer for any of it.
No one even knows what it meant to my family or to me.
Somebody should.
Someone should make a statement.
A statement?
That's cool.
I know a place.
Wolfe is beginning to remember things.
- What does it mean?
- Nothing, I think.
His brain has to heal daily, forming new connections.
I don't know that his actual thoughts, his memories even exist any longer.
When's the next test?
When I'm ready.
When I feel confident I won't kill anyone else.
We need to get this done.
So let me work.
I gave something to Olympia when I hooked up with him.
This stuff, Sway.
It's like a powers booster.
Johnny Royalle is using you to pimp out drugs.
It's not like that.
Oh, it's exactly like that.
It wasn't even him.
It was this guy, Bug.
Johnny was really mad when he found out.
Don't make excuses for him.
You're being used.
He is exploiting you.
He is offering you something he cannot give you.
You don't need powers in order to be powerful.
Right.
Come, let me show you something.
You're not gonna call the police?
No, you're under my protection now.
But let me show you how power really works.
First, you have to look the part.
Come on.
Golden got something on that Chubb182 username.
Guy's name is Larry Gerald.
It's linked to a Show Us Your Powers account.
Posted a new video.
Levitation Boy taking off.
Catch me if you can.
He was priming his powers.
"Priming his powers"?
All he could do was hover, nothing badass.
Why do you think he was hanging out with a Wannabe like me?
Kidz with legit power think the rest of us are losers.
How did he do it, Larry?
Sway.
Shit cranks the limits.
It's a total boost.
He thought he could do some trick night flying, maybe get his video to go viral, but guess he needed to take more.
That's an unregulated powers enhancer.
Who'd he get it from?
You don't tell me, I'm going to assume it was you.
I'm going to ask you again.
Who did he get it from?
The new place.
Here and Gone.
Johnny Royalle?
I don't think so.
I don't know.
Shit.
Where's the rest of it?
Thought that maybe it could, uh, give me some powers, but then he fell.
I didn't have the balls.
At least you're alive.
Sway.
You know, the kid was holding.
He's a kid.
You wanna ruin his life for being stupid?
If Royalle is selling powers enhancers, dropping him down the Shaft gets easy.
Have to make sure you do it the right way.
Probably have to go to his club, see it happen.
But not too close.
Just observational, for fuck's sake.
Observational.
Fuck yeah.
What happens if I kill you?
Nothing.
The deal is the same.
You attack me, the test commences, and clemency is yours.
They shorted one of my eyes.
That's okay.
Just saying I'm not at my best.
Okay.
You can't ride the lightning!
I can't...
I feel...
What do you feel?
I can't feel myself.
- Really?
- Yeah!
It's funny.
Can't believe you did an episode of Baywatch.
Yeah.
Shouldn't you be looking out there?
I thought Righteous Thunder never left New York.
Hawking his new energy drink would be my guess.
Did you ever have your own energy drink?
- They weren't a thing in my day.
- Oh.
Sneakers?
Black Diamonds.
It's in the book.
Around page 76, I think.
- You think.
- Yeah.
Ooh, can I get a pair?
The '90s are totally coming back.
Why are we here?
I told you, I'm going to show you how power really works.
Try not to squint.
Motherfucker.
She fucking lied to us.
Calista's been with her the whole time.
If we go in there, we are the lead story in the Powers That Be.
And Royalle's lawyers rain down shit on the entire division, so...
- Listen to me.
We can go in there, okay?
- Uh-uh.
She is like fucking gravity.
When she goes into a room, everybody is paying attention to her.
Okay.
Okay.
We have to be some di-fucking-screet motherfuckers.
Okay?
No distractions with your personal shit, with, like, your former ex and your bestie.
Okay?
Di-fucking-screet.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's go.
Welcome to Here and Gone.
We're honored to have you.
Shit.
God damn it!
I thought you said di-fucking-screet.
I thought you wanted the fuck inside.
Powers or a face, people, that's how you get inside.
Hey, schoolboy!
Yeah, you got something.
Come on.
Watch your back.
This way.
She brought Retro Girl.
Create some space for a private chat, please.
Excuse us.
- Hey, Ma'am.
Please go back.
- Retro Girl.
Retro...
Retro Girl, I love you!
I love you!
Excuse us.
A little space.
A little more space, please.
Excuse us.
Thank you.
Okay.
Do you see her?
Got her.
Or not.
How's it going, man?
All right, dude.
Thanks, baby.
The Kidz are taking Sway.
Mmm.
And the bald creep, creeps, whatever, they're doing the passes.
Royalle's dealing in his own club.
You're trying to make me jealous?
- I was just about to come find you.
- To tell me what?
That you brought Retro Girl to my home?
- What did you tell her?
- I didn't tell her anything.
What does she want here?
She wants to protect me.
She wants to show me something.
What does she want to show you?
She wants to show me how real power works.
You kept talking about how she's so dangerous.
But I'm close to her now.
She won't do anything to hurt me.
And I can protect you, make sure she leaves you alone.
And if you tell me what you're doing, I could, you know, help you.
Please don't be mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.
I'll never be mad at you.
But it's time to go to the safe place.
But...
Go to the safe place, Annabel.
We can figure out just cause later.
There's a stash here somewhere.
Unregulated power enhancer, that's a massive bust.
He's not dealing.
He's giving it to them.
There's no money changing hands.
Righteous Thunder, Queen Noir, none of the big Powers are on Sway.
He's giving it to the Kidz.
Fuck.
We need to get Calista.
Now.
Yeah.
I'll circle around the top.
All right.
Back door in five.
See you then.
Hey.
See ya.
Other people wanna take a shit and do blow, douchewad.
What the...
This is some uncivilized shit, man.
Calista!
No, no, no, no.
Time to go now.
Get off me!
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
What the fuck is going on here?
This... this is what's going on.
That supposed to mean something to me?
It would if you could read.
You know how many lives I've saved?
How many cops I've saved?
Don't flash that crackerjack shit at me.
It's a party, so ease up on the kid.
I got some crackerjack shit for you.
Edwin.
Patty.
Christian-motherfucking-Walker.
I ain't seen you in a minute.
You all right?
Peachy.
- She with you?
- Yeah.
Teach your partner some manners.
Fuck you.
Let it go.
We need to ask her some questions.
Fuck that cop shit, brother.
The kid was with Philip when he died, Edwin.
Sad days, man.
Olympia dying in bed.
I ain't going out like that.
There are worse ways to go.
Ain't the same up there without you, bro.
Ain't the same since you fell.
Appreciate it.
We have to go out the front.
How are you still alive?
I ran away before Wolfe could kill me.
Much as that seems to have disappointed humanity.
No, I mean, how are you still living with yourself?
How have you not killed yourself yet?
If I'm such a figure of repulsion, why are you here?
Did you come here to, what, beat me up?
Well, in just the few moments that I've been here, that's enough for the Twitter-verse to explode.
"Retro Girl visits Johnny Royalle's nightclub."
And the minute I walk out that door, the world will be quivering in anticipation of what I'll say.
And when I tell them, "Yes, it's a fine place to bring your mom and dad and do some B-list Power watching,"
you'll be out of business in a week.
And when that week is over and nobody's watching you, cares about what you do,
I may come back to beat you up.
You're hurting me.
- We dodged the bald guy?
- Yeah.
Well, don't worry about them.
Christian.
Detective.
I'm so glad you could come.
Simons informs me someone's broken in through a back door.
Are you here to investigate this illegal entry?
Don't get close to him.
Because, I mean, what other reason would you have for entering a licensed establishment run by a registered Power who has a restraining order against the entire fucking Powers Division?
Calista, come here.
Calista, on the roof...
They can't touch you.
On the roof, I was wrong.
You're not like everybody else.
You proved that when you jumped.
They can't take you away.
There's something inside of you that won't give up, won't give in.
Come with us.
Calista, it's time to go.
It's under control, Janice.
Yes, it is because she's coming with me.
I'll go with you.
I love you.
Stop touching me and grabbing me!
You do what you have to do.
But you're on your own.
Fuck this.
You're coming with us.
- We are the police, okay?
- Calista.
Enough of this.
They can't take you away from your home.
I'm sorry.
It wasn't safe back there.
Where are we?
Where are we?
I'll tell you a story.
You never know, she could've been picked up by a pervert.
Oh, yeah, you know everything.
You always do.
I told her Becca's mom couldn't bring me home.
- I kept waiting for her, but...
- Where do you want to go?
Come on.
Where should we go?
There is no place.
I was reading about Bear Island in the Barents Sea, off Norway.
The beaches have snow instead of sand.
It'd be cold.
Oh, God damn it.
Screw you!
Bear Island is one of the cleanest places on Earth.
Hardly anyone lives there.
They don't even have phones there.
No one could find us.
That's where we should go.
Annabel, get out here!
We're gonna go away from here, Bel.
- Close your eyes.
We're not here.
- I don't want to go away.
I just don't want him to hurt me anymore.
We're gonna go to Bear Island and we're gonna make snow angels on the beach.
And we're gonna go away.
- If you were here...
- What are you doing in here?
Huh?
Come here!
You can't hide from me!
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
- Leave her alone!
- Get out of my way!
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Annabel?
You came back for her, right?
I was 15.
I don't know, but this deserted island, the night lasts all winter, the winters are long.
I didn't even understand how I got there.
I mean, I knew I must be a Power, but I didn't know how it worked.
I tried, I tried to get back.
But I couldn't, not for years.
It was too late.
Is it something that you can fix?
Let's go home, Calista.
I had her.
- I fucking had her.
- I know.
And I was doing everything right in there and then I had to go and lose my shit.
You were good in there.
You're a good detective and a good partner.
I need you to hide.
Wait.
What?
No.
You can't leave me here.
Simons will come get you.
They won't think to look for you here.
You have to trust me.
I don't understand.
There's something I gotta do.
Just hide.
- Johnny, don't leave me!
- I'll be back.
Hey.
Uh, hey.
Uh, you know how to get out of here?
Yeah, I do.
Thirty-six seconds late.
I left her out back.
Go get her.
Can I go home, Johnny?
I want to go home now.

Previously on Powers...
It's Olympia.
Whatever was in this envelope was also in his blood stream.
I killed Bug.
This is my signed confession.
- You know her?
- Calista.
Just a Wannabe.
- What do you do?
- I do stuff with light.
- Yeah.
- My name's Zora.
- No, no!
- Why were you on that roof?
Walker, he pushed me.
I caught you falling in the arms of a man with whom I share an incredibly complicated history.
I know she's lying.
I've spent all day listening to her lies and waiting for you to either call or come by.
I left a message.
On the number that I used to...
- The old number.
- I don't use that number anymore.
I had these lucky ties.
Only have one left, and I can't find it.
Your tie, it's askew.
I'm here to register my powers as law...
Can't an old friend pop by?
Blue Magma.
I have an offer of clemency.
They'll never let me out of here.
They will.
If you do something to atone for the people you incinerated.
What's the offer?
An experimental treatment.
What treatment?
Classified.
What do I do?
To participate in the trial, all you have to do is attack me.
Fuck you, Triphammer.
You're not gonna test some new weapon on me.
My weapons and my armor have nothing to do with it.
Ronnie, you wanted to be a hero, but you weren't good at it.
People died.
Now you have a chance to make up for the misery you caused.
All you have to do is take a shot at the guy who put you in here.
That, or spend your life thinking of the kids you killed.
It's gone.
The fire is gone.
You put the fire out.
You put the fire out.
I put the fire out.
Fuck!
Fucking fuck!
You're close, Harley.
Another one.
I killed another one.
What does it feel like?
It doesn't feel like anything to me.
I don't have powers.
But I expect it makes them feel like I feel without my armor.
Helpless.
And then it kills them.
Blue Magma, Ronnie Marquez, he had kids.
I have kids.
You remember what you said to me about them the day you came to me with the idea of the Drainer?
You remember what you said would happen to them if we didn't try to make this a reality?
You said they would all die.
You said 50 years was the most they could hope for.
You came to my home and you pronounced a death sentence on my kids, on every child in the world, within 50 years, if we didn't do this.
I have never once, since that day, allowed myself the liberty of feeling powerless.
Look at you.
The price you've paid to battle monsters.
Are you done with that now?
You know the guy?
- Yeah.
- Mmm.
Fucker just fell out of the sky.
Boom.
Thank fuck no one was inside.
Jesus shit.
My son's not much younger than him.
You sure you got this?
Yeah, we got it.
Thanks.
The younger ones, I can't, you know?
Partner's a class act.
You look like shit.
He brought it back.
I was up all night just sitting there with my gun hoping he'd come again.
- Pass this clusterfuck back to Golden.
- Well, hey.
Let's go to that asshole's club and find Calista.
- Hey...
- I got him on breaking and entering.
- You wanna see a dead body?
- No.
I want to find Calista and bust Royalle.
Come take a look.
Shit.
That's the kid who was with Zora.
I didn't think he was a flier.
He has a registered powers profile.
"Levitation Boy.
Maurice St. Clair.
Max vertical lift is three feet, no propulsion."
For his body to do this much damage and still remain intact, he couldn't have reached terminal velocity.
He must have been falling for five, six seconds.
So that's, maybe, 500 feet.
He dropped from a plane?
No.
This is Class B airspace.
Even the smallest planes have to fly between 6,000 and 10,000 feet.
Look at the big brain on you.
When I first started flying, I used to crash all the time.
Only got a handle on it after I got my pilot's license.
Just because you can, doesn't mean you know how.
He came at an angle.
From there.
Anything?
I'm wondering where Calista might be going next.
What other fucked up shit she might try to get powers.
Is this a hangout for the Powerz Kidz?
No.
No, it's not central enough for them.
So they probably wouldn't make a habit of coming up here to party, get high.
I'll come back later.
It's okay.
I know you don't think about girls that way.
I mean, you and Simons are a thing.
Right?
Simons' sexuality defies categorization.
I'm not that modest.
Modesty is an unappreciated virtue these days.
Okay.
Unexpected beauty is a nearly sacred thing.
A revelation changes you by the act of noticing it.
Hold something of yourself in reserve.
The promise of revelation.
Do you think the cops are still looking for me?
You going somewhere?
Do I need permission?
You can go wherever you want.
But, yes, the police are still looking for you.
You have no idea what it feels like to be trapped.
How do you think I discovered my power?
I spent a long time wishing I could get away from what my life was like.
And then...
You made your escape from the police, you even eluded Retro Girl.
But still I wonder...
What?
I keep thinking of you, hiding, listening to Retro Girl as she betrayed you.
But you still admire her, don't you?
She's still Retro Girl.
No, she's not.
Retro Girl is not a person.
She is the overexposed image that's been sold to you.
She's a lie, Calista.
And until you free yourself from that trap, she will keep on hurting you.
Retro Girl is lonely and vulgar, but she is vastly powerful.
And you are not the only one who'll get hurt.
Who would have known Zora would have been juiced up like this?
PAR?
What is she, like, 20?
Well, she must have something real or they wouldn't bother.
So, back when this guy was the keynote at our annual retreat, and Richard made it my job to make sure that he got there on time.
So I finally tracked him down at the Hotel La Chapelle, where he was shacked up with some very famous actress, and he's hammered.
- You remember this?
- Yeah.
So I get him in the costume and into the limo.
We pull in to the Four Seasons, paparazzi is everywhere, he pulls down the mask, looks at me and pukes all over me.
And you know what he says? "Sorry, dude.
It was either you or them, and you don't have a camera."
- That was a long time ago.
- Times change.
I mean, here I am.
There you are.
And here these are.
What the fuck?
Yeah, looks like your agent doesn't recognize your dead friend.
Okay.
See, when my client tells me some cops are harassing her on the street...
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
... and then sans counsel, you make her show you some fucking after hours club...
It's a murder investigation.
Don't say a fucking word to them.
Hey, we have a dead kid.
She saw him two nights ago.
And you dump this shit on my table?
You used to be an asshole that could fly, now you're just an asshole.
She's a star.
She's a fucking hero, and I won't...
Don't talk like I'm not here!
Look at me, but don't see just me.
See the whole room.
Extend your peripheral vision.
You are in control.
Okay?
We weren't a thing.
We made out a few times, but I really don't know him.
See?
She doesn't know...
The Wannabe, Calista, whatever happened between the two of you, she ended the night by jumping off a building.
- Is she...
- She's alive.
But she's still missing.
We don't want her to end up like this.
Chubb182.
I think Zora is tired.
Just look it up.
Chubb182.
Thank you.
The flowers.
When did this start?
When the cops came.
After this last awake and aware period,
I pulled out the orbitoclast, and he said the same thing.
- Is something wrong?
- The cellular regeneration is the basis of his speed, strength and toughness.
Even his ability to consume and absorb biokinetic energy.
We can't turn his powers off.
We can only retard them.
Christian?
Johnny?
By severing his self-awareness.
Is he still in there?
Something is in there.
The power is certainly still in there.
You know, I read his book in high school.
We all read his book.
His book was bullshit.
Let me know if he says anything new at the next awake and aware period.
I thought it was a good book.
Tell her I'm not a criminal.
Are you not a criminal?
You ran from the police.
You said that I could trust you, and then you sold me out to the cops.
No.
I never said that.
I never promised you anything.
I brought you into my home and you lied to me.
And I don't have time for this.
Call Powers Division.
Royalle said that you're dangerous.
That you're gonna hurt me and everyone around me.
So, tell me about Royalle.
He's trying to build something.
So what does he want from you?
Why are you with him?
I want powers.
I mean, I have powers, I just haven't...
No one takes me seriously.
That's why I jumped off the building.
Diamond...
Walker said that that's how he found his powers.
You would have died.
Do you understand that if I hadn't been there, you would have died?
But you've always saved me.
Not you, um...
My mom.
My dad would lose his shit, over anything.
You never knew what would set him off, but you knew what was coming.
And my mom would flash this Retro Girl tattoo that she had on the back of her hand.
It was like a promise that she would keep me safe.
And she did.
She would stand between me and him, and she would take as many punches as she could.
She pretended to be you to make herself strong.
I know it's crazy, but I knew that you would save me if I jumped.
The fall killed him.
Also, he has red corkscrews in his DNA.
This stuff again?
Olympia with the exploding heart, the headless Power with the impossible wound, and the flier who can't fly.
All appear to have been taking the same, well, let's call it a drug until we know otherwise.
- What does it do?
- I have no idea what it does.
We have three dead Powers.
If Wannabes decide to try it, my guess is they'll die instantly.
Great.
- How soon until we can identify...
- Probably never.
I'll do what I can.
Thank you, Doc.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, it's me, Kaotic Chic, again.
You sure you don't think this is weird?
I'm not stalking you or anything.
It's all good.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Why do you play the game?
I like hurting them.
It makes me feel in control.
Like I'm not weak.
I know that's fucked up.
It's not.
My cousin died when some asshole wrecked a building fighting another asshole who was trying to blow it up.
Makes perfect sense, right?
One got away and one got a movie deal.
No one had to answer for any of it.
No one even knows what it meant to my family or to me.
Somebody should.
Someone should make a statement.
A statement?
That's cool.
I know a place.
Wolfe is beginning to remember things.
- What does it mean?
- Nothing, I think.
His brain has to heal daily, forming new connections.
I don't know that his actual thoughts, his memories even exist any longer.
When's the next test?
When I'm ready.
When I feel confident I won't kill anyone else.
We need to get this done.
So let me work.
I gave something to Olympia when I hooked up with him.
This stuff, Sway.
It's like a powers booster.
Johnny Royalle is using you to pimp out drugs.
It's not like that.
Oh, it's exactly like that.
It wasn't even him.
It was this guy, Bug.
Johnny was really mad when he found out.
Don't make excuses for him.
You're being used.
He is exploiting you.
He is offering you something he cannot give you.
You don't need powers in order to be powerful.
Right.
Come, let me show you something.
You're not gonna call the police?
No, you're under my protection now.
But let me show you how power really works.
First, you have to look the part.
Come on.
Golden got something on that Chubb182 username.
Guy's name is Larry Gerald.
It's linked to a Show Us Your Powers account.
Posted a new video.
Levitation Boy taking off.
Catch me if you can.
He was priming his powers.
"Priming his powers"?
All he could do was hover, nothing badass.
Why do you think he was hanging out with a Wannabe like me?
Kidz with legit power think the rest of us are losers.
How did he do it, Larry?
Sway.
Shit cranks the limits.
It's a total boost.
He thought he could do some trick night flying, maybe get his video to go viral, but guess he needed to take more.
That's an unregulated powers enhancer.
Who'd he get it from?
You don't tell me, I'm going to assume it was you.
I'm going to ask you again.
Who did he get it from?
The new place.
Here and Gone.
Johnny Royalle?
I don't think so.
I don't know.
Shit.
Where's the rest of it?
Thought that maybe it could, uh, give me some powers, but then he fell.
I didn't have the balls.
At least you're alive.
Sway.
You know, the kid was holding.
He's a kid.
You wanna ruin his life for being stupid?
If Royalle is selling powers enhancers, dropping him down the Shaft gets easy.
Have to make sure you do it the right way.
Probably have to go to his club, see it happen.
But not too close.
Just observational, for fuck's sake.
Observational.
Fuck yeah.
What happens if I kill you?
Nothing.
The deal is the same.
You attack me, the test commences, and clemency is yours.
They shorted one of my eyes.
That's okay.
Just saying I'm not at my best.
Okay.
You can't ride the lightning!
I can't...
I feel...
What do you feel?
I can't feel myself.
- Really?
- Yeah!
It's funny.
Can't believe you did an episode of Baywatch.
Yeah.
Shouldn't you be looking out there?
I thought Righteous Thunder never left New York.
Hawking his new energy drink would be my guess.
Did you ever have your own energy drink?
- They weren't a thing in my day.
- Oh.
Sneakers?
Black Diamonds.
It's in the book.
Around page 76, I think.
- You think.
- Yeah.
Ooh, can I get a pair?
The '90s are totally coming back.
Why are we here?
I told you, I'm going to show you how power really works.
Try not to squint.
Motherfucker.
She fucking lied to us.
Calista's been with her the whole time.
If we go in there, we are the lead story in the Powers That Be.
And Royalle's lawyers rain down shit on the entire division, so...
- Listen to me.
We can go in there, okay?
- Uh-uh.
She is like fucking gravity.
When she goes into a room, everybody is paying attention to her.
Okay.
Okay.
We have to be some di-fucking-screet motherfuckers.
Okay?
No distractions with your personal shit, with, like, your former ex and your bestie.
Okay?
Di-fucking-screet.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's go.
Welcome to Here and Gone.
We're honored to have you.
Shit.
God damn it!
I thought you said di-fucking-screet.
I thought you wanted the fuck inside.
Powers or a face, people, that's how you get inside.
Hey, schoolboy!
Yeah, you got something.
Come on.
Watch your back.
This way.
She brought Retro Girl.
Create some space for a private chat, please.
Excuse us.
- Hey, Ma'am.
Please go back.
- Retro Girl.
Retro...
Retro Girl, I love you!
I love you!
Excuse us.
A little space.
A little more space, please.
Excuse us.
Thank you.
Okay.
Do you see her?
Got her.
Or not.
How's it going, man?
All right, dude.
Thanks, baby.
The Kidz are taking Sway.
Mmm.
And the bald creep, creeps, whatever, they're doing the passes.
Royalle's dealing in his own club.
You're trying to make me jealous?
- I was just about to come find you.
- To tell me what?
That you brought Retro Girl to my home?
- What did you tell her?
- I didn't tell her anything.
What does she want here?
She wants to protect me.
She wants to show me something.
What does she want to show you?
She wants to show me how real power works.
You kept talking about how she's so dangerous.
But I'm close to her now.
She won't do anything to hurt me.
And I can protect you, make sure she leaves you alone.
And if you tell me what you're doing, I could, you know, help you.
Please don't be mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.
I'll never be mad at you.
But it's time to go to the safe place.
But...
Go to the safe place, Annabel.
We can figure out just cause later.
There's a stash here somewhere.
Unregulated power enhancer, that's a massive bust.
He's not dealing.
He's giving it to them.
There's no money changing hands.
Righteous Thunder, Queen Noir, none of the big Powers are on Sway.
He's giving it to the Kidz.
Fuck.
We need to get Calista.
Now.
Yeah.
I'll circle around the top.
All right.
Back door in five.
See you then.
Hey.
See ya.
Other people wanna take a shit and do blow, douchewad.
What the...
This is some uncivilized shit, man.
Calista!
No, no, no, no.
Time to go now.
Get off me!
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
What the fuck is going on here?
This... this is what's going on.
That supposed to mean something to me?
It would if you could read.
You know how many lives I've saved?
How many cops I've saved?
Don't flash that crackerjack shit at me.
It's a party, so ease up on the kid.
I got some crackerjack shit for you.
Edwin.
Patty.
Christian-motherfucking-Walker.
I ain't seen you in a minute.
You all right?
Peachy.
- She with you?
- Yeah.
Teach your partner some manners.
Fuck you.
Let it go.
We need to ask her some questions.
Fuck that cop shit, brother.
The kid was with Philip when he died, Edwin.
Sad days, man.
Olympia dying in bed.
I ain't going out like that.
There are worse ways to go.
Ain't the same up there without you, bro.
Ain't the same since you fell.
Appreciate it.
We have to go out the front.
How are you still alive?
I ran away before Wolfe could kill me.
Much as that seems to have disappointed humanity.
No, I mean, how are you still living with yourself?
How have you not killed yourself yet?
If I'm such a figure of repulsion, why are you here?
Did you come here to, what, beat me up?
Well, in just the few moments that I've been here, that's enough for the Twitter-verse to explode.
"Retro Girl visits Johnny Royalle's nightclub."
And the minute I walk out that door, the world will be quivering in anticipation of what I'll say.
And when I tell them, "Yes, it's a fine place to bring your mom and dad and do some B-list Power watching,"
you'll be out of business in a week.
And when that week is over and nobody's watching you, cares about what you do,
I may come back to beat you up.
You're hurting me.
- We dodged the bald guy?
- Yeah.
Well, don't worry about them.
Christian.
Detective.
I'm so glad you could come.
Simons informs me someone's broken in through a back door.
Are you here to investigate this illegal entry?
Don't get close to him.
Because, I mean, what other reason would you have for entering a licensed establishment run by a registered Power who has a restraining order against the entire fucking Powers Division?
Calista, come here.
Calista, on the roof...
They can't touch you.
On the roof, I was wrong.
You're not like everybody else.
You proved that when you jumped.
They can't take you away.
There's something inside of you that won't give up, won't give in.
Come with us.
Calista, it's time to go.
It's under control, Janice.
Yes, it is because she's coming with me.
I'll go with you.
I love you.
Stop touching me and grabbing me!
You do what you have to do.
But you're on your own.
Fuck this.
You're coming with us.
- We are the police, okay?
- Calista.
Enough of this.
They can't take you away from your home.
I'm sorry.
It wasn't safe back there.
Where are we?
Where are we?
I'll tell you a story.
You never know, she could've been picked up by a pervert.
Oh, yeah, you know everything.
You always do.
I told her Becca's mom couldn't bring me home.
- I kept waiting for her, but...
- Where do you want to go?
Come on.
Where should we go?
There is no place.
I was reading about Bear Island in the Barents Sea, off Norway.
The beaches have snow instead of sand.
It'd be cold.
Oh, God damn it.
Screw you!
Bear Island is one of the cleanest places on Earth.
Hardly anyone lives there.
They don't even have phones there.
No one could find us.
That's where we should go.
Annabel, get out here!
We're gonna go away from here, Bel.
- Close your eyes.
We're not here.
- I don't want to go away.
I just don't want him to hurt me anymore.
We're gonna go to Bear Island and we're gonna make snow angels on the beach.
And we're gonna go away.
- If you were here...
- What are you doing in here?
Huh?
Come here!
You can't hide from me!
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
- Leave her alone!
- Get out of my way!
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Annabel?
You came back for her, right?
I was 15.
I don't know, but this deserted island, the night lasts all winter, the winters are long.
I didn't even understand how I got there.
I mean, I knew I must be a Power, but I didn't know how it worked.
I tried, I tried to get back.
But I couldn't, not for years.
It was too late.
Is it something that you can fix?
Let's go home, Calista.
I had her.
- I fucking had her.
- I know.
And I was doing everything right in there and then I had to go and lose my shit.
You were good in there.
You're a good detective and a good partner.
I need you to hide.
Wait.
What?
No.
You can't leave me here.
Simons will come get you.
They won't think to look for you here.
You have to trust me.
I don't understand.
There's something I gotta do.
Just hide.
- Johnny, don't leave me!
- I'll be back.
Hey.
Uh, hey.
Uh, you know how to get out of here?
Yeah, I do.
Thirty-six seconds late.
I left her out back.
Go get her.
Can I go home, Johnny?
I want to go home now.
Previously on Powers...
It's Olympia.
Whatever was in this envelope was also in his blood stream.
I killed Bug.
This is my signed confession.
- You know her?
- Calista.
Just a Wannabe.
- What do you do?
- I do stuff with light.
- Yeah.
- My name's Zora.
- No, no!
- Why were you on that roof?
Walker, he pushed me.
I caught you falling in the arms of a man with whom I share an incredibly complicated history.
I know she's lying.
I've spent all day listening to her lies and waiting for you to either call or come by.
I left a message.
On the number that I used to...
- The old number.
- I don't use that number anymore.
I had these lucky ties.
Only have one left, and I can't find it.
Your tie, it's askew.
I'm here to register my powers as law...
Can't an old friend pop by?
Blue Magma.
I have an offer of clemency.
They'll never let me out of here.
They will.
If you do something to atone for the people you incinerated.
What's the offer?
An experimental treatment.
What treatment?
Classified.
What do I do?
To participate in the trial, all you have to do is attack me.
Fuck you, Triphammer.
You're not gonna test some new weapon on me.
My weapons and my armor have nothing to do with it.
Ronnie, you wanted to be a hero, but you weren't good at it.
People died.
Now you have a chance to make up for the misery you caused.
All you have to do is take a shot at the guy who put you in here.
That, or spend your life thinking of the kids you killed.
It's gone.
The fire is gone.
You put the fire out.
You put the fire out.
I put the fire out.
Fuck!
Fucking fuck!
You're close, Harley.
Another one.
I killed another one.
What does it feel like?
It doesn't feel like anything to me.
I don't have powers.
But I expect it makes them feel like I feel without my armor.
Helpless.
And then it kills them.
Blue Magma, Ronnie Marquez, he had kids.
I have kids.
You remember what you said to me about them the day you came to me with the idea of the Drainer?
You remember what you said would happen to them if we didn't try to make this a reality?
You said they would all die.
You said 50 years was the most they could hope for.
You came to my home and you pronounced a death sentence on my kids, on every child in the world, within 50 years, if we didn't do this.
I have never once, since that day, allowed myself the liberty of feeling powerless.
Look at you.
The price you've paid to battle monsters.
Are you done with that now?
You know the guy?
- Yeah.
- Mmm.
Fucker just fell out of the sky.
Boom.
Thank fuck no one was inside.
Jesus shit.
My son's not much younger than him.
You sure you got this?
Yeah, we got it.
Thanks.
The younger ones, I can't, you know?
Partner's a class act.
You look like shit.
He brought it back.
I was up all night just sitting there with my gun hoping he'd come again.
- Pass this clusterfuck back to Golden.
- Well, hey.
Let's go to that asshole's club and find Calista.
- Hey...
- I got him on breaking and entering.
- You wanna see a dead body?
- No.
I want to find Calista and bust Royalle.
Come take a look.
Shit.
That's the kid who was with Zora.
I didn't think he was a flier.
He has a registered powers profile.
"Levitation Boy.
Maurice St. Clair.
Max vertical lift is three feet, no propulsion."
For his body to do this much damage and still remain intact, he couldn't have reached terminal velocity.
He must have been falling for five, six seconds.
So that's, maybe, 500 feet.
He dropped from a plane?
No.
This is Class B airspace.
Even the smallest planes have to fly between 6,000 and 10,000 feet.
Look at the big brain on you.
When I first started flying, I used to crash all the time.
Only got a handle on it after I got my pilot's license.
Just because you can, doesn't mean you know how.
He came at an angle.
From there.
Anything?
I'm wondering where Calista might be going next.
What other fucked up shit she might try to get powers.
Is this a hangout for the Powerz Kidz?
No.
No, it's not central enough for them.
So they probably wouldn't make a habit of coming up here to party, get high.
I'll come back later.
It's okay.
I know you don't think about girls that way.
I mean, you and Simons are a thing.
Right?
Simons' sexuality defies categorization.
I'm not that modest.
Modesty is an unappreciated virtue these days.
Okay.
Unexpected beauty is a nearly sacred thing.
A revelation changes you by the act of noticing it.
Hold something of yourself in reserve.
The promise of revelation.
Do you think the cops are still looking for me?
You going somewhere?
Do I need permission?
You can go wherever you want.
But, yes, the police are still looking for you.
You have no idea what it feels like to be trapped.
How do you think I discovered my power?
I spent a long time wishing I could get away from what my life was like.
And then...
You made your escape from the police, you even eluded Retro Girl.
But still I wonder...
What?
I keep thinking of you, hiding, listening to Retro Girl as she betrayed you.
But you still admire her, don't you?
She's still Retro Girl.
No, she's not.
Retro Girl is not a person.
She is the overexposed image that's been sold to you.
She's a lie, Calista.
And until you free yourself from that trap, she will keep on hurting you.
Retro Girl is lonely and vulgar, but she is vastly powerful.
And you are not the only one who'll get hurt.
Who would have known Zora would have been juiced up like this?
PAR?
What is she, like, 20?
Well, she must have something real or they wouldn't bother.
So, back when this guy was the keynote at our annual retreat, and Richard made it my job to make sure that he got there on time.
So I finally tracked him down at the Hotel La Chapelle, where he was shacked up with some very famous actress, and he's hammered.
- You remember this?
- Yeah.
So I get him in the costume and into the limo.
We pull in to the Four Seasons, paparazzi is everywhere, he pulls down the mask, looks at me and pukes all over me.
And you know what he says? "Sorry, dude.
It was either you or them, and you don't have a camera."
- That was a long time ago.
- Times change.
I mean, here I am.
There you are.
And here these are.
What the fuck?
Yeah, looks like your agent doesn't recognize your dead friend.
Okay.
See, when my client tells me some cops are harassing her on the street...
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
and then sans counsel, you make her show you some fucking after hours club...
It's a murder investigation.
Don't say a fucking word to them.
Hey, we have a dead kid.
She saw him two nights ago.
And you dump this shit on my table?
You used to be an asshole that could fly, now you're just an asshole.
She's a star.
She's a fucking hero, and I won't...
Don't talk like I'm not here!
Look at me, but don't see just me.
See the whole room.
Extend your peripheral vision.
You are in control.
Okay?
We weren't a thing.
We made out a few times, but I really don't know him.
See?
She doesn't know...
The Wannabe, Calista, whatever happened between the two of you, she ended the night by jumping off a building.
- Is she...
- She's alive.
But she's still missing.
We don't want her to end up like this.
Chubb182.
I think Zora is tired.
Just look it up.
Chubb182.
Thank you.
The flowers.
When did this start?
When the cops came.
After this last awake and aware period,
I pulled out the orbitoclast, and he said the same thing.
- Is something wrong?
- The cellular regeneration is the basis of his speed, strength and toughness.
Even his ability to consume and absorb biokinetic energy.
We can't turn his powers off.
We can only retard them.
Christian?
Johnny?
By severing his self-awareness.
Is he still in there?
Something is in there.
The power is certainly still in there.
You know, I read his book in high school.
We all read his book.
His book was bullshit.
Let me know if he says anything new at the next awake and aware period.
I thought it was a good book.
Tell her I'm not a criminal.
Are you not a criminal?
You ran from the police.
You said that I could trust you, and then you sold me out to the cops.
No.
I never said that.
I never promised you anything.
I brought you into my home and you lied to me.
And I don't have time for this.
Call Powers Division.
Royalle said that you're dangerous.
That you're gonna hurt me and everyone around me.
So, tell me about Royalle.
He's trying to build something.
So what does he want from you?
Why are you with him?
I want powers.
I mean, I have powers, I just haven't...
No one takes me seriously.
That's why I jumped off the building.
Diamond...
Walker said that that's how he found his powers.
You would have died.
Do you understand that if I hadn't been there, you would have died?
But you've always saved me.
Not you, um...
My mom.
My dad would lose his shit, over anything.
You never knew what would set him off, but you knew what was coming.
And my mom would flash this Retro Girl tattoo that she had on the back of her hand.
It was like a promise that she would keep me safe.
And she did.
She would stand between me and him, and she would take as many punches as she could.
She pretended to be you to make herself strong.
I know it's crazy, but I knew that you would save me if I jumped.
The fall killed him.
Also, he has red corkscrews in his DNA.
This stuff again?
Olympia with the exploding heart, the headless Power with the impossible wound, and the flier who can't fly.
All appear to have been taking the same, well, let's call it a drug until we know otherwise.
- What does it do?
- I have no idea what it does.
We have three dead Powers.
If Wannabes decide to try it, my guess is they'll die instantly.
Great.
- How soon until we can identify...
- Probably never.
I'll do what I can.
Thank you, Doc.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, it's me, Kaotic Chic, again.
You sure you don't think this is weird?
I'm not stalking you or anything.
It's all good.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Why do you play the game?
I like hurting them.
It makes me feel in control.
Like I'm not weak.
I know that's fucked up.
It's not.
My cousin died when some asshole wrecked a building fighting another asshole who was trying to blow it up.
Makes perfect sense, right?
One got away and one got a movie deal.
No one had to answer for any of it.
No one even knows what it meant to my family or to me.
Somebody should.
Someone should make a statement.
A statement?
That's cool.
I know a place.
Wolfe is beginning to remember things.
- What does it mean?
- Nothing, I think.
His brain has to heal daily, forming new connections.
I don't know that his actual thoughts, his memories even exist any longer.
When's the next test?
When I'm ready.
When I feel confident I won't kill anyone else.
We need to get this done.
So let me work.
I gave something to Olympia when I hooked up with him.
This stuff, Sway.
It's like a powers booster.
Johnny Royalle is using you to pimp out drugs.
It's not like that.
Oh, it's exactly like that.
It wasn't even him.
It was this guy, Bug.
Johnny was really mad when he found out.
Don't make excuses for him.
You're being used.
He is exploiting you.
He is offering you something he cannot give you.
You don't need powers in order to be powerful.
Right.
Come, let me show you something.
You're not gonna call the police?
No, you're under my protection now.
But let me show you how power really works.
First, you have to look the part.
Come on.
Golden got something on that Chubb182 username.
Guy's name is Larry Gerald.
It's linked to a Show Us Your Powers account.
Posted a new video.
Levitation Boy taking off.
Catch me if you can.
He was priming his powers.
"Priming his powers"?
All he could do was hover, nothing badass.
Why do you think he was hanging out with a Wannabe like me?
Kidz with legit power think the rest of us are losers.
How did he do it, Larry?
Sway.
Shit cranks the limits.
It's a total boost.
He thought he could do some trick night flying, maybe get his video to go viral, but guess he needed to take more.
That's an unregulated powers enhancer.
Who'd he get it from?
You don't tell me, I'm going to assume it was you.
I'm going to ask you again.
Who did he get it from?
The new place.
Here and Gone.
Johnny Royalle?
I don't think so.
I don't know.
Shit.
Where's the rest of it?
Thought that maybe it could, uh, give me some powers, but then he fell.
I didn't have the balls.
At least you're alive.
Sway.
You know, the kid was holding.
He's a kid.
You wanna ruin his life for being stupid?
If Royalle is selling powers enhancers, dropping him down the Shaft gets easy.
Have to make sure you do it the right way.
Probably have to go to his club, see it happen.
But not too close.
Just observational, for fuck's sake.
Observational.
Fuck yeah.
What happens if I kill you?
Nothing.
The deal is the same.
You attack me, the test commences, and clemency is yours.
They shorted one of my eyes.
That's okay.
Just saying I'm not at my best.
Okay.
You can't ride the lightning!
I can't...
I feel...
What do you feel?
I can't feel myself.
- Really?
- Yeah!
It's funny.
Can't believe you did an episode of Baywatch.
Yeah.
Shouldn't you be looking out there?
I thought Righteous Thunder never left New York.
Hawking his new energy drink would be my guess.
Did you ever have your own energy drink?
- They weren't a thing in my day.
- Oh.
Sneakers?
Black Diamonds.
It's in the book.
Around page 76, I think.
- You think.
- Yeah.
Ooh, can I get a pair?
The '90s are totally coming back.
Why are we here?
I told you, I'm going to show you how power really works.
Try not to squint.
Motherfucker.
She fucking lied to us.
Calista's been with her the whole time.
If we go in there, we are the lead story in the Powers That Be.
And Royalle's lawyers rain down shit on the entire division, so...
- Listen to me.
We can go in there, okay?
- Uh-uh.
She is like fucking gravity.
When she goes into a room, everybody is paying attention to her.
Okay.
Okay.
We have to be some di-fucking-screet motherfuckers.
Okay?
No distractions with your personal shit, with, like, your former ex and your bestie.
Okay?
Di-fucking-screet.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's go.
Welcome to Here and Gone.
We're honored to have you.
Shit.
God damn it!
I thought you said di-fucking-screet.
I thought you wanted the fuck inside.
Powers or a face, people, that's how you get inside.
Hey, schoolboy!
Yeah, you got something.
Come on.
Watch your back.
This way.
She brought Retro Girl.
Create some space for a private chat, please.
Excuse us.
- Hey, Ma'am.
Please go back.
- Retro Girl.
Retro...
Retro Girl, I love you!
I love you!
Excuse us.
A little space.
A little more space, please.
Excuse us.
Thank you.
Okay.
Do you see her?
Got her.
Or not.
How's it going, man?
All right, dude.
Thanks, baby.
The Kidz are taking Sway.
Mmm.
And the bald creep, creeps, whatever, they're doing the passes.
Royalle's dealing in his own club.
You're trying to make me jealous?
- I was just about to come find you.
- To tell me what?
That you brought Retro Girl to my home?
- What did you tell her?
- I didn't tell her anything.
What does she want here?
She wants to protect me.
She wants to show me something.
What does she want to show you?
She wants to show me how real power works.
You kept talking about how she's so dangerous.
But I'm close to her now.
She won't do anything to hurt me.
And I can protect you, make sure she leaves you alone.
And if you tell me what you're doing, I could, you know, help you.
Please don't be mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.
I'll never be mad at you.
But it's time to go to the safe place.
But...
Go to the safe place, Annabel.
We can figure out just cause later.
There's a stash here somewhere.
Unregulated power enhancer, that's a massive bust.
He's not dealing.
He's giving it to them.
There's no money changing hands.
Righteous Thunder, Queen Noir, none of the big Powers are on Sway.
He's giving it to the Kidz.
Fuck.
We need to get Calista.
Now.
Yeah.
I'll circle around the top.
All right.
Back door in five.
See you then.
Hey.
See ya.
Other people wanna take a shit and do blow, douchewad.
What the...
This is some uncivilized shit, man.
Calista!
No, no, no, no.
Time to go now.
Get off me!
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
What the fuck is going on here?
This... this is what's going on.
That supposed to mean something to me?
It would if you could read.
You know how many lives I've saved?
How many cops I've saved?
Don't flash that crackerjack shit at me.
It's a party, so ease up on the kid.
I got some crackerjack shit for you.
Edwin.
Patty.
Christian-motherfucking-Walker.
I ain't seen you in a minute.
You all right?
Peachy.
- She with you?
- Yeah.
Teach your partner some manners.
Fuck you.
Let it go.
We need to ask her some questions.
Fuck that cop shit, brother.
The kid was with Philip when he died, Edwin.
Sad days, man.
Olympia dying in bed.
I ain't going out like that.
There are worse ways to go.
Ain't the same up there without you, bro.
Ain't the same since you fell.
Appreciate it.
We have to go out the front.
How are you still alive?
I ran away before Wolfe could kill me.
Much as that seems to have disappointed humanity.
No, I mean, how are you still living with yourself?
How have you not killed yourself yet?
If I'm such a figure of repulsion, why are you here?
Did you come here to, what, beat me up?
Well, in just the few moments that I've been here, that's enough for the Twitter-verse to explode.
"Retro Girl visits Johnny Royalle's nightclub."
And the minute I walk out that door, the world will be quivering in anticipation of what I'll say.
And when I tell them, "Yes, it's a fine place to bring your mom and dad and do some B-list Power watching,"
you'll be out of business in a week.
And when that week is over and nobody's watching you, cares about what you do,
I may come back to beat you up.
You're hurting me.
- We dodged the bald guy?
- Yeah.
Well, don't worry about them.
Christian.
Detective.
I'm so glad you could come.
Simons informs me someone's broken in through a back door.
Are you here to investigate this illegal entry?
Don't get close to him.
Because, I mean, what other reason would you have for entering a licensed establishment run by a registered Power who has a restraining order against the entire fucking Powers Division?
Calista, come here.
Calista, on the roof...
They can't touch you.
On the roof, I was wrong.
You're not like everybody else.
You proved that when you jumped.
They can't take you away.
There's something inside of you that won't give up, won't give in.
Come with us.
Calista, it's time to go.
It's under control, Janice.
Yes, it is because she's coming with me.
I'll go with you.
I love you.
Stop touching me and grabbing me!
You do what you have to do.
But you're on your own.
Fuck this.
You're coming with us.
- We are the police, okay?
- Calista.
Enough of this.
They can't take you away from your home.
I'm sorry.
It wasn't safe back there.
Where are we?
Where are we?
I'll tell you a story.
You never know, she could've been picked up by a pervert.
Oh, yeah, you know everything.
You always do.
I told her Becca's mom couldn't bring me home.
- I kept waiting for her, but...
- Where do you want to go?
Come on.
Where should we go?
There is no place.
I was reading about Bear Island in the Barents Sea, off Norway.
The beaches have snow instead of sand.
It'd be cold.
Oh, God damn it.
Screw you!
Bear Island is one of the cleanest places on Earth.
Hardly anyone lives there.
They don't even have phones there.
No one could find us.
That's where we should go.
Annabel, get out here!
We're gonna go away from here, Bel.
- Close your eyes.
We're not here.
- I don't want to go away.
I just don't want him to hurt me anymore.
We're gonna go to Bear Island and we're gonna make snow angels on the beach.
And we're gonna go away.
- If you were here...
- What are you doing in here?
Huh?
Come here!
You can't hide from me!
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
- Leave her alone!
- Get out of my way!
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Annabel?
You came back for her, right?
I was 15.
I don't know, but this deserted island, the night lasts all winter, the winters are long.
I didn't even understand how I got there.
I mean, I knew I must be a Power, but I didn't know how it worked.
I tried, I tried to get back.
But I couldn't, not for years.
It was too late.
Is it something that you can fix?
Let's go home, Calista.
I had her.
- I fucking had her.
- I know.
And I was doing everything right in there and then I had to go and lose my shit.
You were good in there.
You're a good detective and a good partner.
I need you to hide.
Wait.
What?
No.
You can't leave me here.
Simons will come get you.
They won't think to look for you here.
You have to trust me.
I don't understand.
There's something I gotta do.
Just hide.
- Johnny, don't leave me!
- I'll be back.
Hey.
Uh, hey.
Uh, you know how to get out of here?
Yeah, I do.
Thirty-six seconds late.
I left her out back.
Go get her.
Can I go home, Johnny?
I want to go home now.
Some of you may think you know what hell looks like.
Get up!
You have no idea.
With former soldiers of six of the world's toughest special forces, we've created the ultimate military boot camp
to help shed light on unique selection methods of these units.
For 12 days, 29 of Britain's fittest civilians will take this on.
Are you slow-witted?
!
There's something about competition.
I do think I'm tough enough to be in the special forces.
Special forces is the biggest and the most extreme challenge, I think, that's out there, you know.
When you think special forces, you think superheroes really.
- Go!
- Go!
I'm Freddie Flintoff.
As an elite sportsman, I know that it takes grit and determination to be the best.
- That's it.
- I'll help understand their battle...
Keep going then, use it.
..and cheer them on, every punishing step... ..as our raw recruits attempt to push themselves beyond their physical and psychological limits.
Only the very best will survive.
Go home now.
Taking them through hell are former officers from the US Navy Seals...
We were brought up to weed out the weak.
Up!
Down!
..the Australian SAS...
- You've got the determination?
- Yes, sir.
- The will to want to continue?
- Yes, sir.
You sure?
Let's go, let's go, let's go... ..Russia's Spetsnaz...
Oh, shit.
You are bleeding!
You are dying!
Put your hands up.
..Israel's Yamam...
- Are you quitting?
- No.
- Are you a survivor?
Yes or no?
- Yes, sir.
..Navsog from the Philippines...
Back to zero.
And, of course, Britain's SAS.
We're going to be bezzies.
Only then will the final winner emerge on Special Forces Ultimate Hell Week.
This is it.
Where the fun begins.
# Episode 1x03 # Philippines NAVSOG Original Air Date on September 13, 2015
Previously, 29 recruits were fully immersed in elite military training led by our former Navy Seals.
22 survived to face Itay and the Israeli Special Forces phase.
What are you, a pussy?
Get out of it!
By the second day, Lycett was running on empty and quit.
Physically, it's just not happening.
Spicer was injured in fighting and left for hospital, as did Falaran, who injured his hand.
Meanwhile, the other recruits faced a brutal challenge.
Come on!
Let's go!
In the final parade, both Parker and Maguire were sent home.
Leave the camp.
You have failed.
Controversially, Spicer rejoined the group with a medical all-clear and rested shoulders.
Guys, I didn't mean to leave you.
I'm sorry, guys.
I am so pissed off that he didn't have to do that carry thing.
And he's going to be fresh as a daisy tomorrow.
18 recruits remain, but who will make it through the next 48 hours?
It's day five in base camp, where our civilian recruits are living under a strict military regime.
It is important that at all times, your levels of standard cleanliness in your tents must be top level or there'll be punishment.
Directing staff, or DS, have ordered the recruits to ready the camp for an early inspection.
- Ready?
- Yep, happy.
Then it's a last chance to stretch out injured limbs before the next Special Forces instructor piles on the pain.
I think I got a knee in the back of the calf.
Lacey was knocked in the same fighting exercise that sent Spicer to hospital.
Here to win it for his late dad,
Lacey's short fuse bought him unwanted attention during our Navy Seals training.
I want to be supporting my team and the crew.
- I don't want to sit in a tent.
- Shut up, Lacey.
It almost earned him an early exit.
Lacey, you showed weakness.
There is no room here for weakness.
The medic checked it this morning, but it's quite swollen so he just said, "See how you go today."
So I'm hoping we'll be all right.
OK, campers, let's get on parade.
And he won't have to wait long, as a member of the directing staff prepares recruits to meet the next instructor.
Stand to attention.
Stay in your pairs, follow up.
I can't believe how intense this is.
Our remaining 18 are battered, they're bruised.
They've already done a day's work before they meet the next special force.
And that is Navsog from the Philippines.
I'm Dante Membrere and I'm a Lieutenant in Navsog for six years now.
We deal with smuggling, drugs, kidnapping and counter-terrorism.
We encounter terrorism weekly.
Navsog stands for Naval Special Operations Group.
Set up in 1956 as underwater specialists, today, the elite navy unit disrupts rebels and criminals hiding among the Philippines' 7,000 islands, striking by air, land and sea.
Our principles are simplicity, precision, repetition and violent use of force.
The British recruits - they're going to hate me.
Dante has left strict orders to make the recruits race the 400 metres to meet him.
He wants to see how fast you guys can run.
Do not be last.
Do not be in the back end of this group.
Go!
Come on.
British recruits, they are pampered babies.
They're not used to people treating them like shit.
I'm going to teach the British recruits about loving the pain, because if you still feel the pain, you cannot think properly.
Over the next 48 hours, if the recruits aren't prepared to take on that pain,
Dante can dismiss them on the spot.
And the scrutiny starts as the recruits are divided into two teams at the finish line.
Red, blue.
Red.
Blue.
It's Parrish and Hunter, the two oldest remaining recruits, who are the last to arrive.
I want to find the losers, the quitters.
We need to cure the sickness, take out the virus.
Stand still.
Don't talk.
Lacey's injured leg has already put him on Dante's radar.
- What are you doing, Lacey?
- Oh, it's my calf.
You sorted?
OK, stand still, don't talk.
I'm Lieutenant Membrere.
I'm a member of the Naval Special Operations Group.
I'm still in active service.
You can call me Tor, short for instructor or tormentor.
Lesson number one - in Navsog, when instructors greet recruits like you, they do 20 push-ups, synchronised with the same counting.
Drop down!
In Navsog, push-ups are a basic measure of strength and are used to push recruits to exhaustion, sometimes up to 3,000 at a time.
Three...
Halt.
Halt.
Is that what you call all together?
Synchronised and coordinated?
Back to zero.
Listen!
Listen, listen.
- Three, two...
- I just want one guy commanding.
- Go.
Up, one, stop.
Down, up, two, stop.
Steggles stood out during our Israeli special forces training... making him a front runner in the competition.
Steggles, I like your style.
You're a badass.
With this process, I think it's going to be a lot more mental.
If you can't navigate around a hill, which I'm hoping I can, then it doesn't matter how fit you are if you're running around in circles.
I will get at least to the last couple of days.
Down, up, five.
Down, up, six.
Down, up.
Halt.
Because Mr Anderson here stopped.
My God, only 20 push-ups?
You cannot do it?
And you are joining the special forces?
OK, I want ten push-ups all together, coordinated.
Down, up, seven.
Down, up, eight.
Down, up, nine.
Down, up, ten and halt.
Halt on your feet, guys.
On your feet.
Teamwork and physical conditioning is even more important for Navsog than other special forces with bigger budgets.
We don't have the latest equipments.
We don't have the latest machines, so I want you to be tougher, stronger and smarter.
And I want you to beat the machines.
And straight away,
Dante shows there is nowhere to hide from his scrutiny.
I want these two guys who were the last ones during the race,
I want you to come in front.
Hunter and Parrish may be the oldest remaining recruits, but they won't be getting an easy ride from Dante.
You'll be the leader of the red team and you'll be the leader of the blue team.
Today, we're going to do a search and rescue operation.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
So you're going to go to the coordinates 19201949.
(19201949...)
OK and I need you to brief your teammates.
Go.
Using a map and compass, each team must find a medical casualty and evacuate it to safety using what they pick up at checkpoints along the way.
There's a turn in the river here and we're right at that bend there.
Part of your training is all about improvising, using the best of the resources you have.
Yeah, I want to see them push themselves.
I need to see them synchronise and I know I want to see the team leaders doing their job.
And to put extra pressure on the leaders, each team must carry a Navsog training log of 180 kilos every step of the way.
Hurry up.
One, two, three.
But the blues have a secret weapon.
Their leader, Hunter, is ten-times world coal carrying champion.
Lift the log upwards.
Up, up, turn it round to the right.
Tell them to go now.
If the causality is dead already...
Double time, come on.
The blue team is away before reds have planned their route.
This is a search and rescue operation and you're still looking for something there?
It's already Christmas.
Hey, guys, found him.
Here we go!
Come here.
Let's go, come on.
Under Hunter, the blue team find the casualty first.
- One up, drag him out.
- Let's go, boys.
They'd been told to improvise a stretcher out of bamboo to carry the casualty around the course.
OK, we're going to swap leaders.
Hunter has proved himself a competent leader, so Dante puts the unwanted pressure of leadership on to Gatenby.
Ex-boxer Gatenby hung up his gloves undefeated in early 2015.
I'm built like a Jack Russell with the heart of a lion.
He was nearly down and out in hand-to-hand combat with a damaged knee.
I fear it's not going to last two minutes.
- Do you want to withdraw?
- No, no.
Let's carry on with it.
I don't know how far I'll get, but no matter how much pain or whatever hurt I'm in, I will not give up.
But leading his team in the race to make a stretcher is out of Gatenby's comfort zone.
That's going to hurt the back of the casualty if he has back injuries.
Twist at the bottom, OK, and create some knot.
You need to control your team, because you are the team leader.
Try it out, yeah.
We know what we're doing.
Ah, jackets, boys!
Jackets.
Swapping leaders is part of Navsog training, simulating an officer's death or injury during operations.
Team leader, come here.
You're not doing your job.
Hit the water.
OK, get back here, get back here.
OK.
I need you to do your job, command your team, is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
The strongest on the log, yeah?
- Lift!
With the stretcher made of their coats, they carry the 50-kilo casualty off to the next check point...
..together with the 180kg log.
40 minutes into the race, the red team are lagging behind and the leader, Parrish, is lost.
What are we doing?
Guys, we're just looking at the map!
Guys, this is really heavy!
Second-last in the race to meet Dante, 50-year-old Parrish has failed to make an impression.
So out of these four, the weakest?
- Parrish.
- This is natural selection.
If I was to describe myself in three words - full of insecurity.
As an endurance athlete who's swum the Channel,
Parrish is used to training on his own.
But leading a combat unit is something new.
You think over here?
When weight-lifting coach Steggle spots the dummy, he immediately takes control.
I've got my hand up.
Come on, guys.
Don't walk in my back, mate, so they can see me.
- This is the stream.
- Yeah.
Get the casualty out.
We're going to get a sleeve each, we're going to knot it.
Literally an over under and an under over.
As more confident team members get on with making the stretcher,
Parrish looks vulnerable for an early exit.
I can't visualise exactly what you mean so you start organising how this looks to you.
- Parrish, they got...
- Sorry, can I speak, please?
- Underneath.
Underneath.
- Did my suggestion make any sense?
Yeah, perfect.
OK, everybody.
Everybody, you, you stay here.
All of your team stay there, sit down.
You're not doing...
- You're not doing any good.
- OK.
Disciplining teams in cold water is standard Navsog practice.
- Think about this.
- OK.
OK.
Well, brief them what to do.
And punishing the team puts extra pressure on Parrish.
Dante is testing his decision making.
OK, guys.
We need to think about this quickly cos you're sitting in the water.
- Come on then.
- Yes, we know that!
Let's go and work out what you want to do as a stretcher.
You tell us what to do!
Calm down.
OK, we have to use the jackets.
- How many poles are you going to use?
- We'll need...
We're going to need potentially two or four, Danny?
Put the two poles through each arm of the jacket and the jacket itself becomes then the stretcher.
Let's try that idea first and get out the water.
- Come on.
- Do it now, do it now.
I feel a little bit sorry for Parrish, pushed into a role that doesn't come naturally to him so he's...
I think he's definitely struggling there.
And Dante's not going to let Parrish escape the team punishment.
Just lie down and go back.
OK, come back here, Parrish.
- Yes, sir.
- OK, go down.
- OK.
I need you to prove yourself.
I don't want to see you be the virus again.
I suspect I might have a couple of long days ahead of me.
Always best not to be noticed.
Blown that, then.
It looks like Dante has found his virus already.
Parrish has made such a bad impression.
Gatenby too.
He's had a soaking, but at least he managed to lead his team away first.
Say when you want to stop, please.
Gatenby's team has successfully made a stretcher out of coats for the 50-kilo casualty.
But with five recruits now stuck on the log full time, the exercise is showing up who is and who isn't pulling their weight.
Hellard, you are doing fuck all on that log.
Don't think you can sit there and do fuck all on that log and I'm not going to notice.
Get hold of some of that weight and help your teammates.
I am, sir.
Hellard's singing voice made popular during the Navy Seals phase.
# Without saying a word #
# You can light up the dark... #
But he was spotted by Itay as a potential weak link.
Hellard, I don't think so.
He'll never be a real sergeant.
He's a little too soft.
I'd lose an arm wrestle to most grannies, but I do think I'm tough enough to be in the Special Forces.
that's why I'm doing this, to show that actually it's about mental willpower.
This side is hanging out there.
When the blue team nearly drop the casualty, it's a chance for Dante to see how much difference Hellard is making.
Let's put the head in.
OK, you're not taking care of the casualty well, so let's change that with a real person.
Hellard, come here.
Hellard, you will be the one lying there.
Makes it interesting, means it's more weight for us on the log.
Just psychology.
They're trying to shift the goal posts on us.
We started off playing football and now we're playing Aussie rules.
Might as well get a nap.
Well done, guys.
With four, not five, on the log, there's increased pressure on Lacey's injured calf as the blues race to the next check point.
And even Hunter, a coal carrying champion, is feeling it.
Tough.
Very tough.
I'm at me limit now.
I don't know how much of this I can take.
It's just horrible.
- Oh, fuck.
My shoulder.
- Left, right, left...
Meanwhile, the red team have finally made the stretcher and are 15 minutes behind blue.
My shoulders are already screwed from yesterday.
OK, drop load.
And down.
Dante has put frontrunner Steggles in charge, after sacking Parrish for his poor performance.
Well done so far.
Fantastic.
Very quickly what we're going to do - listen, don't talk, just look at me, eyes on me - it's roughly along this road 150 metres.
That makes sense?
Same chaps on the log.
Us three, we'll be on the stretcher.
If everyone is happy with that say, "Yes, Lee."
Yes, Lee.
OK.
Let's get going.
We're running a little bit behind.
I think Steggles has just taken over now.
In order to get the job done, I think we need a strong leader.
I want to hear a "Hell, yes." if you want to win this task.
- One, two, three...
- Hell, yes!
Thank you.
Uneven ground, uneven ground.
The blue team's lead has dropped to seven minutes as they find the next check point and Hellard is released from the stretcher.
As in the real Navsog search and rescue test, recruits must find a military cache...
Help me carry it.
Help me carry it.
..a hidden boat and a pump waiting to help them evacuate the casualty.
Pull it back, spread it out.
But they haven't looked for the pump.
Come on, everyone.
Find a point and start blowing into it.
It's coming out.
It's blowing out of here.
It's cos it's not sealed.
It's strange.
They managed to find the boat, but they're blowing it up with their mouths.
It's going to take ages.
Dante decides it's time for a new leader and wants to see if the injured Lacey can keep his cool under pressure.
Can't you see you're missing something?
That you need to blow that up?
Come on.
Use your common sense, man.
There's got to be something else that I'm missing like a pump.
There's got to be a pump somewhere.
- Lacey?
- Yes.
- What are you missing?
- I'm missing a pump.
- OK.
There's a price to pay for a little help.
OK, do 20 push-ups more, because I gave you the pump.
Go.
One, two, three...
Move, move, move, move!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Three, two, NEXT!
Navsog trainees practise teamwork, carrying rafts up to 10km.
Straight on your shoulders.
Everyone all right, yeah?
Lacey just has to lead his team 200 metres to the river, but Hellard is struggling.
You go in there and I'll jump out.
Ready?
- OK.
- Go, go, go, go.
- Call it when you're ready.
- Yep, ready.
Ah, that's better.
Thanks, man.
I'm just too tall to be in the middle.
I've found a boat!
Under Steggles' leadership, the red team are catching up with the blues.
Danny, you are in charge of scouting and finding a pump.
- Let's just get this undone first.
- "Steggles is a good leader".
I think we've all got a lot of respect for him.
He's strong and he's a nice guy.
We've found one.
Guys, guys, guys.
After spotting the other team's abandoned pump, they're hoping to make up more time.
OK, go.
Yeah, it's going.
I can hear it.
Just get it in the water.
Keep going.
Walk the boat out.
Arriving at the river, the blue team have to transport their casualty 500 metres to the end of the race.
Stroke.
Stroke.
Down boat, in three, two, one.
Down boat.
With Dante swapping Steggles for Miller, the reds now have the blue team in their sights.
OK we are going to paddle pretty hard.
Front and centre move.
Move.
Miller was picked out as class leader during the Navy Seals phase.
OK, guys, listen in.
I want...
She's been consistently strong ever since.
If you follow, give me a "Boo-yah!"
Boo-yah!
I see them.
Let's go get them.
With her now in charge of the red team, they may be in with a chance.
Stroke.
OK, harder left.
But Parrish has been put in charge of steering.
Left, OK, now all stroke.
And a left straight.
Left, I mean, hard right.
Not left, sorry.
You can see their direction just keeps on zigzagging.
There's no leadership.
They're not doing it together.
Three, two, one, go.
Three, two, one, go.
As the blues bring the casualty safely to shore,
Lacey's team are triumphant.
OK, drop it down.
Straight down in front of me.
When the reds cross the line 14 minutes later, they've lost all the time they made back under Steggles.
One, two, three, lift.
OK, and just hold it there.
For both teams, it's been a tough morning.
Hellard thought he was going to get away with coasting,
Dante spotted him.
For the red team, Steggles really shone, but Dante seems to think that Parrish is dragging the team down.
Recruits grab some rations while they can - a tin of tuna with 150 calories.
Oh, I hate tuna.
I have to chuck, like, half a jar of mayonnaise in it.
Hellard is concerned about his shoulder.
This shoulder here is, is pretty ruined and the staff was having a go at me.
And despite his storming job on the log all morning, medics are seriously worried about the state of Lacey's calf.
I'm just going to squeeze that calf just to make sure that your Achilles is still...
OK, right, we won't do it again if it's hurting.
All right.
OK, look, we're in a bit of a pickle, aren't we?
So shall we take a wander away from, from the guys and, erm, have a chat about what we're going to do about it?
The medics believe that Lacey may have torn a muscle in his calf.
- There is only one option left.
- That's the problem, isn't it?
You haven't got the opportunity not to put major pressure through it so I think, from a medical point of view, it's probably safer that we withdraw you from the competition, erm, as a result of that injury.
- See you, son.
- See you later, bruv.
Take care, mate.
See you soon, yeah.
I did say, "Can I just dose up on pain killers and just carry on?"
And they just said,
"If you do that, you're going to have permanent damage."
Take care.
Unlucky.
I thought I could come here and win the whole competition and I still feel that.
Erm, that's why I didn't want to go.
Me dad passed away from cancer so it would have been nice to make him proud
Just choked to be going, but there you go.
Come on, get tidy in twos.
Teams of two.
Medical checks completed, Dante's tormenting continues, which starts, as always, with press-ups.
OK, recruits.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
OK, guys, are you all listening to me?
Down, up, one...
Once again, Steggles leads the group, but not everyone can keep up.
- Down, up.
- 19.
- Down, up.
- 20.
Because Hellard is not doing it properly, another ten.
I can see you, Hellard.
Do it properly.
I thought it was, staff.
Sorry, staff.
Hellard, suck it up.
Down, up.
Hellard, lower!
Down, up, two.
Hellard, push yourself.
Down, up, three.
- Down, up.
- Hellard.
Push it up.
Halt.
Everybody halt.
It's just ten push-ups, Hellard, and you cannot do it.
- Sorry, sir.
- You want to quit?
No, sir.
OK, another ten.
Down, up.
Come on.
Hellard, you've got this.
Driver, get down to the floor and release your hands.
OK, another ten again, because Hellard cannot do it.
Everyone up.
One more.
One more, Hellard.
OK, another five.
- Fucking hell, guys!
- Another five!
- Down, up.
- One.
- Down, up, louder.
- Two.
- Louder!
Down, up.
- Three!
- Louder.
Down, up.
- Four.
- Down, up.
- Five.
On your feet.
Get in line.
After once again showing physical weakness,
Hellard will need to prove himself to Dante this afternoon.
Now the search and rescue continues with an obstacle course to increase pressure on the recruits...
We've divided you equally.
and Dante wants to change the team dynamic.
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to swap the teams.
Parrish, Spicer and Martlew join the winning blue team with Martlew as leader.
As a world-class obstacle course racer, this should be her event, but she struggled as a leader during the Yamam phase.
Lacey, do you want to...?
Do you want to take over?
Just be confident that what you say goes.
Ready?
Off you go.
Wait!
Steady, steady.
Stop.
Halt.
Wait, wait, wait.
OK.
The teams have to race across the course without the 180-kilo logs touching the ground or the obstacles and as always, Dante is watching.
I've got front, I've got front.
I've got weight at front.
Yeah, look at Spicer.
He's saying I got back,
I got front and then he's not even carrying anything.
- Yeah, I've got front support.
- Move back.
Move back.
Yesterday, Spicer missed out on a tough final challenge due to an injury.
He's been trying to show his commitment to his teammates ever since.
Take it easy, man.
Come on.
Stop feeling guilty about yesterday.
I've got supporting back, guys.
The new team dynamic is doing its job and has revealed another weak link for Dante.
He's a danger for the team, because he creates confusion.
He steals authority.
Yeah, we're coming back.
We're coming back.
OK.
Yeah, jumping off.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't do that again.
Don't do that again.
The red team may be trailing, but they're making steady progress under Anderson's calm leadership.
This is nice, guys, well done.
Get a little conveyor belt going.
But as they head to the end of the course, what the teams don't realise is Dante has a painful and frightening Navsog speciality waiting for them.
Take your helmet off and you're going to pick up a mask.
Recruits have to fill a mask with water and run with it on their faces, making it difficult to see and breathe.
OK, everybody, go through me so that I can see these have water.
OK, you have water.
Navsog use the exercise to condition combat divers not to panic under water.
Breathe in your mouth.
Relax, breathe in your mouth.
I feel like I'm drowning.
I feel like I'm drowning.
In training, Navsog divers run 5km in masks filled with salt water.
Yeah, trying to breathe and talk through my mouth.
That's horrible.
If you're down in the water, you shouldn't panic.
You should love water.
If they finish, I think they're going to grow gills already.
Now the stretcher comes back into play, as both teams carry their 50kg casualty...
Keep it going.
..and 180-kilo log to the next check point.
Under Martlew, the blue team is first away with stretcher and log.
Argh...
I need to switch.
I'm sliding back, I'm sliding back.
- OK, change shoulders.
- Rest there, rest there, rest there.
- OK.
- When you put your hand out like this, and you can just about see a blob, a pink...
- It's really irritating to the eyes as well.
- Yeah.
The pain of the challenge plus their inability to see are causing problems.
Oh, shit.
Hold on.
I'm walking into stinging nettles here.
With the search and rescue operation going on for three hours,
Dante wants to see which recruits have the mental focus to complete the mission.
Keep going.
Keep going.
The recruits don't realise it, but their judgment is about to be tested.
For the last task, they have to travel to the final checkpoint and signal for evacuation by starting a fire.
Once I'm confident I know where we're going...
Dante singles out Hellard to show what he can do as leader.
So we know how to get there from here?
- Are we happy to go?
- Are we allowed to go?
Is it straight across the field or are there better paths?
But in their haste, the reds set off without one crucial team member.
They forgot the dummy.
They've been carrying this thing around all day and the minute when they need to evacuate it, they left him by river.
That's a basic error, isn't it?
The reds are the first to find the final checkpoint.
It's fine, we can light a fire.
- Who's the team leader?
- Yes, sir.
Hellard, you're going to do a medical evacuation but you don't have the casualty.
OK, so, sir, do we need to give a body for the casualty?
Of course, this is a medical evacuation.
Right, stop what we're doing.
We've got to go get the body.
The blues are arriving also empty-handed.
- That's it.
We're here.
- Where's the casualty?
This is a medical evacuation and you don't have the casualty.
I just sent back the two teams.
They're tired and they are in pain and they made a mistake.
I'm not really impressed with that.
The blue team leave their secret weapon behind to start the fire.
Had to go with my son on a little survival course and I learnt how to make one then without matches.
OK.
Gently, gently.
It's going.
Come on, come on, you...
After half an hour...
Dante has seen enough.
Everybody, gather round.
OK, my instructions were so simple.
Make a fire and there's no fire yet and then the casualty I think already bled out.
So I think both of your teams failed.
Fall out.
So close.
I was so close to redeeming myself in the eyes of my team after this morning's fiasco, but alas, it wasn't to be.
OK, we're round to the right.
Right wheel.
You've got to feel sorry for Parrish and Hellard.
That is not the afternoon that they was after.
Dante's also picked up on Spicer.
I think he's trying to maybe win his teammates over after yesterday, but Dante is far from convinced.
Quick march.
Left, right, left, right, left, right.
It's the end of the first day but Parrish, Hellard and Spicer still need to impress Dante in this evening's final test, based on Navsog's hell blast ceremony.
Sprint to your tents and retrieve your metal mugs.
Go.
Will they suffer for the team or prove themselves as the weak link
Dante has been looking for?
The ceremony starts with a foul-tasting drink made with fish and soy sauce.
Just don't throw up.
That's awful.
That is awful.
- And what happens if people refuse?
- They're going to go back home.
- It's as simple as that.
- Simple as that.
Welcome to hell blast.
Come to the front and fill your cup.
Drinking the liquid is the test of obedience all Navsog recruits face before graduation.
Bottoms up.
Come on, guys, bottoms up.
Spicer, you're cheating.
Come on, Parrish, finish it.
Don't throw up, Parrish.
I want everybody to put their cups on their head when they're finished.
OK, I forgot, good evening!
Good evening.
Get ready for press-ups.
The original test mixes exercise and alcohol with drinking penalties for the losers.
I want the teams to do a competition of push-ups.
Ready?
Go.
Until one gives up.
Down, up, one.
The task is about pushing yourself to protect your team.
Down, up, three.
Down, up, four.
Down, up, five.
Down, up, six.
Down, up...
It's Hellard who is the first to break.
- Down...
- Halt.
On your feet, because Hellard gives up.
Red team, go and fill your cups there.
Hurry up, hurry up.
And now the whole team is punished.
Why are you giving up?
I'm not giving up, sir.
You're pulling them down.
They're going to drink the nasty stuff because of you.
I will drink all of their drinks, sir.
OK.
OK, everybody drink.
No-one cheats.
Hellard, come here in front.
OK, do a push-up properly.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to give you a last chance.
If you can do 50 push-ups, you're going to stay.
And if you cannot, you'll go.
- I cannot do 50 push-ups, sir.
- Do it.
- You're not even trying.
- Come on, David.
Come on!
You're not even trying.
One...
Two...
You're going to hit your face on the floor.
Come on, David!
- Goddamn it.
- OK, come here.
You need to go home now.
- No, sir.
I apologise...
- You need to go home now!
There, it's finished.
You're not pushing yourself.
I want silence in the parade ground.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
I just...
I just feel I've, erm...
I just feel a bit humiliated, to be honest.
I consider myself a strong person.
I don't know in how many battles you'd choose someone who can do push-ups over someone who can do navigation, who can manage a team and who can then lead them to victory.
I think I've learned enough today so I'm going to keep an eye on you.
Off you go.
I wasn't expecting that.
I'm not sure Hellard was either.
These guys are going to have to be at the top of their game and Parrish, he's going to have to watch out tomorrow.
I thought I was definitely going.
I thought the whole thing was, you know, I'm the virus.
He's been calling me that.
So he wants to find out...
Yeah, I thought, you know,
I accepted that I was going.
15 hours on duty and they're not finished yet.
Knock, knock.
OK, lads.
Dinner.
Get in there, we'll have your meal and then we'll do a check.
Make sure your weapons are secured and you know where they are and there's not just shit lying around.
Dinner is a chance to remember a fallen comrade.
Hellard stood up there, in Hell and sang Ronan Keating.
- Boo-yah!
- Boo-yah.
Long live Hellard.
To Hellard.
Hellard's one of the people that should be there in the final.
If there's five in the final, he should be there.
And I thought it was frigging disgusting.
I'm really annoyed at myself for not standing up and giving it back.
It's the morning of day six.
16 recruits remain.
OK, get up, everybody.
I'm just doing my duties, getting everyone ready.
This morning, staff have appointed Steggles camp leader.
Guys.
Let's look at the toilet.
Let's look at the showers.
Guns.
With transport waiting to take the recruits to the next challenge, there's no time for stragglers.
I need it all tidy as well.
I want it all laid out like, erm, like it was going to get inspected, which it is.
Nothing on the floor, like, tidy as you can.
I think it's fair to say that I have started to be able to sort my shit out.
My admin has improved 3,000%.
I'm feeling proud of myself this morning.
Quick march.
Left, right, left, right.
But how many of our 16 recruits will make it back to base?
For the second day, Dante from the Philippines will test the recruits.
So many of our recruits are endurance athletes so today is the first chance that they'll be able to show what they're made of.
Recruits have to swim round an island then run 15km back to base camp.
It's based on Navsog's Ironman circuit, designed to find the ultimate recruit.
With Hellard's shock departure last night, the recruits now know
Dante will eliminate anyone on the spot he thinks shows weakness.
If yesterday is about teamwork, today is about individual endurance.
So no more hiding.
So those guys who were not navigating yesterday and just depending on their teammates,
I hope you can find your way back home.
- Get life jackets.
- Go, go, go.
Quiet man Bent has a score to settle.
I want to be ahead of all the people who are becoming army types and barking orders and this sort of stuff.
I want to be ahead of them.
Go!
The recruits have to swim 400 metres breaststroke in full kit.
Real Navsog trainees don't use life jackets, but they swim in tropical water at 30 degrees.
But the water in the lake is a chilling 15 degrees, making hyperthermia a serious risk.
Medical boats are on stand-by to pull anyone out in trouble.
Just two minutes into the race, Francis is already struggling.
I see Francis here, he's coming back already.
He's got one of the safety canoeists bringing him back.
What's happened?
What's happened?
I don't know.
I was just getting pains, pain in my chest and I was...
I couldn't breathe.
In the heating tent, medics give Francis a thorough check over.
I started to get a pain in my chest and then I started to panic, you know.
Obviously couldn't breathe properly.
I'm fine now.
Medics have ruled out hyperthermia, but with Francis failing to complete the swim, he's out of the process.
I'm feeling a bit gutted.
I would have had a great chance if it wasn't for the swimming.
It was just maybe towards the end, but I guess you can't win them all.
This event is perfectly suited for those in trouble yesterday.
Parrish and Spicer have both done triathlons.
But Parrish is struggling with breaststroke.
Parrish, are you going to impress me today?
- I'm doing my best, sir.
- OK.
100m in front, Spicer is pushing hard in fifth place behind frontrunner Brassington.
Brassington is first out of the water.
Get your bergen, Brassington.
Well done.
The times will be carried forward into the run.
Pleased with that.
Spicer sprints his way from the back of the runners up to grab his bergen and finish second.
Spicer.
Happy to get out the water at the front.
Great swimming, it feels great.
Bent has done better than he thought.
Yeah, really happy, actually.
I think I'm seventh in.
For the man who swam the Channel, it's a disaster.
- Feeling strong?
- Erm, no.
- Come on.
- I'm knackered, mate.
I'm not sure that's the right mindset he wants to take into after this.
I think he's got something to prove to Dante.
And there's another surprise, Steggles comes in 13th out of 15.
Don't look like he enjoyed that, Steggles.
It was good.
Slow, it was slow.
Coming in last place, Gatenby spent almost twice as long in the cold water as Brassington.
His confusion could be an early warning sign of hypothermia.
Well done, mate.
Get in, get dry, get out and get on the bus.
Dry off.
Come on, help yourself.
Get moving.
The dazed recruits need firm direction from the med team trying to stop mild symptoms turning into something more serious.
I felt so bad.
I thought I was going to drown.
That was a real gutsy performance from Gatenby but I'm not sure what Dante is going to make of him coming last.
And Spicer, he couldn't talk his way out of this one but fair play to him, he came up with the goods.
I want these bags on the bus in two minutes.
It's a tense drive from the lake to the start of the run where, for the first time, each recruit will have to navigate for themselves.
First, medics need to confirm each recruit is fit enough to continue after the swim.
Going to just go round and take your temperatures to make sure that you're all rewarmed.
Everyone is declared fit and the first coordinates for the run are issued.
Yesterday the recruits were given a navigation lesson.
This is another bit of mission-essential kit for you guys.
But recruit Martlew struggled and was helped by Steggles, a more confident map reader.
How would you know if you've gone too far?
What's your backstop?
Erm.
I can't navigate very well.
It's a bit worrying that we're on our own.
I might not be here tomorrow cos I might not have returned home yet.
This is Martlew's last chance to plan the route with Steggles.
That's that river that we looked at.
OK, I get it now.
Recruits are about to face a course twice as long as the Navsog original.
The 15km run will also test their navigation skills and stamina, essential for covert operations.
For the first time, they're going to be covering distance with fully loaded bags.
Recruits will carry forward the time from the swim so first to start is Brassington, an experienced triathlete.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Go.
Spicer, stand by.
Miller C, stand by.
Go!
Miller C, go!
Go, go, go.
Bent, go.
Bent is seventh away.
After a disappointing swim, Parrish has a lot to prove in this final test.
I've got my eyes on you, Parrish.
- I know you have, sir.
- Go.
Steggles, go.
Gatenby is the last of 15 to leave.
Go.
A full ten minutes after Brassington.
This is tough, especially after that swim.
- Sorry.
- You all right?
Yeah.
Bent, who started two and a half minutes behind, has caught up with the frontrunners after overtaking Spicer.
I mean, a little bit further and no-one's going to see us.
The front runners soon arrive at Checkpoint 2.
There's four along the route where staff will give recruits the next destination to head for.
This junction here.
OK, the next grid.
How's the terrain?
Oh, it's...
- Is it tough?
- It's vertical.
Is it?
You've done some climbing, have you?
You've sweat dripping off your face the whole time.
It's hard.
But near the back, yesterday's favourite, Steggles, is finding it hard to catch up.
How you getting on, buddy?
Erm, nightmare, got a bit confused with what
I was reading on the bus and I've just come off route slightly.
Over an hour into the run, weight and distance are taking their toll.
This is hard work.
Just the constant pounding with the extra weight.
Dante wants to see how physical pain and exhaustion affects their judgment.
I'm lost.
Went in the wrong direction for about 600 metres.
I don't know where I am now.
And Martlew is going round in circles.
OK, your next grid.
Is just up there.
I've been to him already.
You've been to him already?
Yeah, that's where I went, I went all the way along there and up there.
Up ahead, the leading group have split up.
Brassington and Bent are ahead, miles ahead.
That's fine,
I like them so it's all right.
It's the end of the longest physical challenge yet as the front runners approach base.
And Bent arrives first after overtaking Brassington, leaving Steggles and the Army types for dust.
Well done, Bent.
Drop your bergen by the tyres and stand on your spot.
Over six punishing days of training under three special forces veterans,
Bent has been sleep-deprived, starved and pushed physically and mentally but Dante has one more surprise.
Just when recruits think they've finished,
Dante will give them one more exercise to see who gives up.
OK, I'm going to need you to give me 100 burpees.
After you've finished 100, you get one pebble there in the bin.
OK, sir.
Start.
With hundreds of pebbles in the metal bin, recruits don't know how many they will be expected to collect and how long the burpees torture will continue.
Dante, what's going on?
It's what we call the sickener.
We try to test their determination in how they push their limits and how they waste their frustration.
Is this something which you've done before?
Yeah, we always do that in Navsog.
And how did you react to that?
In the first, I was hating it and later on, I'm loving it already.
I'm embracing the pain.
Frontrunner Brassington comes in second.
Brassington, stay in your place.
Yes, sir.
OK.
Give me 100 burpees.
OK.
Go on, Danny.
Slowly, slowly.
I've done some things in me time but this is, this is the toughest thing I've ever done over this period of time.
I'm hoping the end is in sight.
- Well done.
- Thank you, sir.
Miller's back in time to see Ben finish his first 100 burpees.
100, sir.
Get one pebble there.
Just one.
OK, go back in your place.
Give me another 100.
I'm on it.
Not only does Dante keep recruits guessing how many burpees they'll have to complete, he needles them to see if they'll quit.
You sure you're going to go on, Brassington?
- Yes, sir.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
- OK.
Dante's looking for recruits channelling their anger to help them survive the sickener.
It's what Navsog call embracing the pain.
18...
You really want to continue this?
Come on... 19!
20!
We're going to stop now.
21!
- Come on, Bent.
- 22!
All the time, Dante's just into them.
Trying to get them to quit, pushing them and pushing them and pushing them.
If you know someone that doesn't deserve to stay here, you tell me.
Come on, Bent, tell me.
Just one name.
- Is that better?
- I'll tell you who's strong.
David Hellard.
David Hellard is strong.
That's 50. 150.
Good.
Continue, Bent.
151 for David Hellard.
Spicer, sir.
OK.
Spicer's done well coming fourth but it's clear he's not out of the woods yet.
Glory burpees.
Glory burpees.
For David Hellard. 153...154...
These guys are already here.
Is that good for you?
No, sir.
I wanted to win.
OK, you wanted to win and then?
- And then I, I felt...
- And then you lose.
100 burpees for that.
200, sir.
Permission to get another stone?
Impressed with Bent's determination,
Dante releases him from the sickener.
OK, go take a rest, man.
Thank you, sir.
Hurry up and get in here, now.
Back in the mountains,
Anderson's finally managed to find his way to the second checkpoint.
Right, stand to attention.
Where the fuck have you been?
I went, took a detour and went terribly wrong.
Your next grid is 11312044.
Get over there quickly and work that out.
You've got two minutes.
Worst thing that can happen is I get pulled, you know, that's worst-case scenario.
Erm, I just want to try and get across the line.
Come on, Spicer, don't conserve your energy.
Eventually, Parrish strolls in an hour behind the frontrunners.
Parrish, go here.
- 34.
- Do 100 burpees for me.
- Just 100?
- Yeah, just 100.
OK.
As Gatenby finally completes the run...
You look too pale.
You don't think you're going to pass out?
No.
..recruits have been under Dante's scrutiny for 36 hours.
After performing badly in yesterday's obstacle course challenge, Spicer is redeeming himself.
28.
Good counting, Spicer.
You're impressing me, huh.
But Parrish still has more to prove.
Parrish, go and get a pebble.
Great.
(This is well worth it.)
Dante keeps pushing the recruits to quit.
We still have a lot of pebbles in the bucket so we're going to have a long time.
Here's a pebble for you.
Do another 100.
200, sir.
When he's seen enough, Dante sends recruits back to the tents.
Go and rest now, get a little drink.
Parrish is the last to finish.
Last two, Parrish.
- Parrish.
- Thank you, sir.
You're loving the pain already, huh?
Yeah, you're smiling.
Look at you, you did 200 burpees.
Loving it already.
- OK, go get rest.
- Thank you, sir.
Don't lose those pebbles.
I won't...ever.
Bent came from nowhere to win the ironman.
It's like no more
Mr Nice Guy.
I wonder if Dante knows what he's unleashed.
But two recruits have been let down by their navigation,
Anderson and Steggles.
And they're still missing.
Up in the mountains, the DS have followed Steggles' GPS tracker and he's gone way off course.
I'll just push up here a bit.
Yo!
Walk towards my voice.
"Yeah, all call signs, all call signs.
I've got eyes on Steggles now.
Over."
Right, show me where you think you are.
Where I think I am.
I understood the checkpoint to be that bit there.
That is nowhere near the last checkpoint.
- 20 press-ups with your bergen on.
- OK.
One, two, three...
When Anderson finds a checkpoint Steggles missed, his race is over.
- We're going to pull you from the race, OK?
- OK, sir.
And I'm going to return you back to base.
- Do you understand?
- Understand, sir.
Anderson and Steggles are now en route to the parade ground where Dante and the other recruits are waiting.
It's up to Dante who goes home tonight.
And who's a virus dragging their teammates down.
Anyone can go home tonight.
Steggles, yesterday you're a good team leader.
Anderson, I see how you're organised, I was impressed.
While you were strolling in the mountains, your teammates here were really, really working hard...
..so... ..go home.
I feel pretty shit about it, to be honest with you.
You want to kind of do as well as you can in the competition and you want to stay on, but I've only ever done this once before so, erm, yeah, I just didn't cut the mustard today at all.
If you can't, you know, work out navigation then, you know, you can't, you can't be in the special forces.
You go out on your sword, you mess up, you mess up.
- Steggles so far has been strong.
- Yeah.
Anderson as well seemed to be getting stronger.
In a real-life scenario, you're going to get lost in the mountains, you're going to risk the lives of others.
Steggles and Anderson have gone but have the rest done enough to impress Dante to continue to the next phase?
For the rest of you... you were tough, you got better.
I was impressed.
So... good evening.
Good evening!
Good evening, sir.
Dante has decided not to fail anyone else.
The two which you've kept in, Parrish and Spicer, have they done enough to turn it round to stay here?
Yeah, they were pushing themselves a lot, showing me a lot of spirit.
I was looking at Parrish and he was like accepting everything - the pain, yeah.
20.
On your break!
You're dismissed.
Parrish has dodged a bullet for a second day in a row.
I did feel I was holding people back and, you know, is that what he meant by a virus?
Somebody who's pulling teams back, but...erm,
I'm not, yeah, I won't quit.
I'm a bit mental but I think that's what
Dante was picking up on - just like, "You just won't go, will you?"
The mood in the camp is high but Steggles' departure has hit Martlew hard.
He was teaching me how to map read.
He never would have got lost if it wasn't for me.
The constant mental pressure has begun to take its toll on the recruits.
I marked his start point wrong on his map, that's why he got lost.
He shouldn't have gone cos he's the strongest person in here.
But that's his fault for messing up the nav, he shouldn't have followed you.
It's not your fault.
I don't even want to be here now.
Next time.
Get up, you scumbag, get up.
The recruits are taken to hell and back, behind enemy lines with Jason, a veteran of the Australian SASR.
They face new levels of hardship.
Welcome to Vietnam.
Everyone is pushed to breaking point.
Do you understand that?
This is so fucked up.
What's this - a bastard holiday camp?
Stop.
Come on.
How are you?
- Good.
And with you?
Legitimation, please.
Of course.
Give it here.
How many times I said now all you do not throw the ball?
Are you trying to scare your sister?
She cries.
- Of course she's crying.
She is still a baby.
You've also been that.
Yes, Papa.
What is it?
- Nothing.
What is it, Juan Pablo?
I want her to die.
That you should never say.
We are family and should always take care of each other.
Do you hear me?
Hey?
- Poison shot some cops dead.
Well, how much?
- Two.
Two what?
Brigadiers or agents?
Agents.
You know Poison anyway.
Agents are a million each.
- Okay, so two million.
I write it down.
- Well, I'll talk to you later.
Ok ?
.
What was that about?
Just matters.
I want to be just such a businessman like you.
Pablo opted for all-out war.
He paid for every dead policeman.
There were more than 200 massacred.
There was a mortuary to be built.
The police retaliated.
My name is Alba Borraga, born in 1962, in Popay?
n.
My father Sandoval, my mother Mar?
A. We have a large tobacco plantation.
I studied chemical engineering at the University of Cauca.
Do it once more and look at me.
I did it all 17 times.
You engaged me and my wife here.
Sit down and do it again for it is good.
My name is Alba Borraga, Born in 1962 in Popay?
n.
My father Sandoval, my mom Mar?
A. We have a large tobacco plantation.
I studied chemical engineering at the University of Cauca.
What do I do with chemistry questions?
Hopefully you bluff well.
Sit down.
Again.
It's going better.
We were protecting Elisha because they Escobar could link to the Palace of Justice.
But we were protecting a communist.
That made us traitors.
Can you imagine.
We go.
Are you done?
- Yes.
Honey, thank you.
Make sure we get Escobar.
- I want him dead.
We have no death squads.
You do not do the US in Latin America.
What did you say?
- Honey, calm down.
You're angry, but we must do this.
As if I had what to choose.
There is no other choice.
You may be thinking to go back to Miami.
They sit in their car.
Wait a second.
I do perhaps.
Just get in.
They drive.
Forward.
I had Connie never have to get here.
She is unsuitable.
He has that red bitch with him.
- Do not do anything stupid.
Keep your head down.
It's so over.
Cut him off.
Here to the left.
Disembarking, Murphy.
Get out.
Away from the car.
- You followed me?
Get him away.
- Quiet.
Backwards, dammit.
- Keep your hands ...
Get your hands off me.
You spying on me?
Who do you think you are?
Where is she?
Backwards.
With whom did you speak?
Pe?
A.
I have problems with my wife.
Problems?
Your husband was smart to let him follow.
I hope he's okay.
Good morning, ladies.
Where are you going?
Sorry, I'm American.
I do not speak spanish.
Do you speak Spanish?
Yes.
I asked where you are going.
Popay?
N.
Legitimation.
Mrs. Connie Murphy.
Alba Borraga.
Good trip.
Thank you.
- Be careful.
Thank you sir.
She is now in the orphanage.
Beautiful.
And Elisha is ok ?
.
Glad you make it good.
Listen, enjoy yourself and call me every hour.
Call me every hour.
Yes I know.
I love you too.
I'm proud of you.
Day.
Now Connie was safe, I could focus on C?
sar Gaviria.
The only one who then ran more danger a Colombian cop was the presidential candidate Colombia.
Gaviria was for expulsion the narco to the USA and we had an interest in he would win the election.
But in order to win he had to get the election alive.
Se?
Or Gaviria?
That door over there.
You must be Agent Murphy.
Nice to meet you.
- You too.
I am Eduardo Sandoval, head of security for dr.
Gaviria.
What can we do for you?
Maybe our agency you give means for Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.
The DEA can not get better on drug traffickers hunt?
It is not separate from each other.
- Agent Murphy.
Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.
Take a seat.
Your Secret Service has informed us about safety.
No meeting in the outdoors, every day one different route home.
After the death of Lara and Gal?
N we knew that already.
Cut it out.
- Exactly.
These men do everything to kill you.
I know.
We take all measures.
Your government has even an armored Cadillac offered that is created for your president.
But driving around in Bogot?
in an American tank makes us determined not to vote for.
We honestly do not know how we should respond to it.
I say 'thank you' when I a new Cadillac will be offered.
Thank you, then.
And this here?
What we need this?
A bullet-proof trousers.
I suggest that you are wearing it.
Thank you for thinking.
We'll keep your advice in mind.
Thanks for your time.
WITH Gaviria IS FUTURE
The audience supported Gaviria its position on extradition.
He became a target.
But our own target Jos?
Rodr?
Guez Gacha we had detected Cartagena, through an informant.
Have you ever heard of a computer?
Someone wanted to sell me one.
No idea what it is.
What's up with you?
It's something technical, like new.
Already on sale?
- Yes, Daddy.
Day, baby.
You look beautiful today.
Calm down, girl.
We do not bite.
Would you like anything else?
- I want you.
No, thank you.
- All right, sir.
I want to fuck her.
There are now more important things, my boy.
Understood?
Say it.
What do you know?
Don Gonzalo, our men are everywhere on the estate.
It's safe.
We also have men in the city.
What can you tell me about Medell?
N?
Same thing, boss.
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc is looking to Pablo.
Thank you, Navegante.
At your service.
- Make sure we stay safe.
Don Fredy.
Boy, I got a question for you.
Are we sheep or wolves?
Wolves.
- Yes, yes.
I like that.
They're in a house outside Cartagena.
Here, in this place.
He is protected by many people.
Navegante, you work for many years for Gacha.
During that period, you will have more deserved we will pay you now.
Why do you want to betray him?
That motherfucker's crazy.
We go there all by him.
I believe him for a penny.
What do you care why is he doing it?
There are 23 agents with obsolete weapons finished in Barranquilla.
He has twice as many people with brand new weapons.
And honestly I've had enough for young men to hunt in death.
So we have to be smart.
We need to lure him into a trap.
If we catch him alive, he gives us Escobar.
And Ochoa's.
The whole cartel.
- Does me no ass, Javier.
I want him dead.
Death does not bother him.
He's just afraid to have to rot in the cell.
That is the real victory.
- I forgot you're a gringo.
What do you mean?
- What risk do you actually walk?
These are not your men.
You have no family here you can lose.
If this goes wrong, you get more widows and orphans.
That's on my shoulders up.
Well I trust his information.
And I trust you.
But if this goes wrong, you'll have to live with it.
What do we have?
Guards at the airport Poison saw there.
Who is this guy?
No idea, but as Poison retrieves himself he is very important.
Here is your payment.
It comes with a freighter to the coast of Spain.
Our trucks bring from there to the Basque Country.
It's all settled.
5,000 kg, otherwise I pick the first flight back to Spain.
How so?
You have an appointment with my cousin.
An appointment for this quantity.
What is this bullshit?
5 000 kilos or no deal.
Than not.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Sorry for my cousin.
5 000 kilos then.
We should not go.
I want you to go to the US.
You'll be safe.
Far away from here.
But if you ...
- Happens to me nothing.
We go.
Protect him, please.
Do not worry, that's good.
I walk along.
Day, Dad.
I love you.
Gaviria's life was in danger my wife was with one fugitive and my partner was in Cartagena.
He had his own mission, with cops those friends and relatives had seen dying by Gacha.
Trujillo example, whose father and two brothers, all agents, ... were killed in firefights with the cartel.
We wanted Gacha just as happy as the narco's wanted Gaviria.
I hated this guy to ask for help.
Su?
Rez was as slippery as an eel, but without the charm.
Hello, Su?
Rez.
- Look who it is.
Golden Gringo.
You do not call, do not write.
I called your office.
I only talk with Pe?
A.
I need to know who this is.
I need to ...
Should ...
Must know who he is.
Do you "need to know who he is."
Give me, fagot.
'Must know who he is. "
Back, damn it.
Back.
You work for me, asshole.
Did you understand that?
Clear?
Do you know who it is?
You tell me?
Su?
Rez knew exactly who it was, and he was not alone.
Jesus Christ.
- If you want to sew someone then you take them out.
What is it?
It looks like it that it Medell?
nkartel an attack on Gaviria has planned.
Since we know nothing about.
Do your work, then instead of other agents spying.
What does he mean?
- Never mind, ambassador.
The CIA has us given these documents but 90 percent of it defaced.
I have in the White House.
What is that?
Dick did not.
I get those files.
You read too many spy novels.
Have you read The Spaniard?
How did you get that?
Madam, he's been days in the country.
Together with one top-assassin Pablo.
Let me see.
- The CIA has information about him.
I now get access or not?
The chamber is, in fact, not white.
He's more ... bordeaux.
Agent Schroeder, you come along?
The White Room was a secret repository to the deepest, darkest Secrets of the CIA.
So secret that 's existence has never been recognized.
Sit here.
Agent Schroeder keeps you keep an eye on.
Where are the files?
I think it's still too soft.
- He is sometimes harder.
I do not know, Pablo.
We can surgery better to postpone.
It's too risky.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.
That's why you become bald.
Very funny, asshole.
Laugh.
How's our boy, mama?
He teaches, but with a heavy hand.
How are you, aunt?
- You tell it.
That has to be able to mingle among the sons of the oligarchs.
Yes sir.
- He can give us information.
And these clowns?
They are a bit nice to you?
More or less.
What do you mean 'more or less'?
We are kind to you.
Can we eat, Gustavo?
Would you like rice?
Thank you.
Jaimito.
Welcome to the family.
Thank you, boss.
Can you absolutely nothing to do?
No.
As long as we are at war, we can do nothing.
What a bunch of crap.
Every day people come to and it is thought that my friends make it happen.
Let's talk about something else.
Yes.
Eg escape on together.
Now you can.
"Together escape." Listen to it.
Why would you go off with a criminal like me?
Why not?
Was it that easy.
I can not just leave.
I know.
It's your wife.
My wife does not interest me.
I mean other woman Pablo.
Who is the woman in the relationship?
Do you?
Gacha was always paranoid when it was quiet.
He began to wonder things about Navegante.
How is it, honey?
What are you doing?
I am married, sir.
No problem, I can so Making widow.
Do not touch me.
Fredy, stay away from her.
Come here.
What is it?
The Search Bloc is here not Medell?
n.
Navegante but said that they were there.
Navegante ...
That's a liar.
He would never betray you.
Fredy, think.
Everyone has a price.
Let's go.
If they want war, they can get it.
Everyone was interested in the Spaniard.
He was a member of ETA.
Never heard of?
Who made an art bomb making.
It was a group of "freedom fighters" Basque who wanted to separate from Spain.
Their specialty was murder public figures.
ETA was behind the murder the Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco on the way home, after a wrong and behind the assassination of Prime Rivera with one remote-controlled car bomb.
The man behind these bombs?
You guessed it: the Spaniard.
His real name is Ephraim Gonzalez.
He is now famous, and for rent.
Expensive, but the best.
Because Pablo hires only the best.
Pablo's plan was to blow Gaviria.
Only: where, when and how?
I appreciate your concern but to cancel the campaign is not an option.
With the new information the cop Murphy discovered reconsiders you hopefully.
He performs in Cali, Boyac?
and a dozen other cities.
You are everywhere a target.
We have done everything what your Secret Service and Spain's Guardia Civil recommended.
We also bomhonden each campaign site, so that's good.
The Spaniard would not know it?
I know.
Tell me how can he win the election if he's hiding like a scared rabbit for all this violence?
What?
How can he win if he's dead?
I will not mention your wife that you died on my watch.
You're not responsible.
Thank you, Officer Murphy, but Eduardo is right.
I venture 't it.
His name is Steve Murphy.
He is of the DEA.
Hopefully you pay for this information.
Su?
Rez talks with the DEA.
You know what to do.
He escaped.
They have slain the maid.
Colonel.
A message from the roadblock.
They stopped a car.
The driver seems to be a senator.
Can he identify himself?
- Everything seems to fit.
What's the problem?
There was a machine gun in the trunk.
Come with me.
Check my papers.
No, I do not know who Gacha.
Why is there a weapon in your trunk?
You ask why a politician a weapon in this country?
Please, say.
He's my bodyguard.
- Where's your bodyguard?
You were still in the car?
Listen, agents if you do not let me go right away, you will regret it.
Thank you.
Ogenblikje.
- Go ahead.
I do not believe him.
Me neither.
He can his papers or bought.
What if he really appears to be a senator?
Then we have a problem.
That's a risk I can not take.
That is true.
Not you.
The next I shoot in your head.
Good.
- Talk, fagot.
I will talk.
I love you, sweetheart.
I love you.
You have a visitor.
It is Don Pablo.
Hello, Jaimito.
Don Pablo.
- Is this your house?
Your family?
- Yes, welcome.
Tell me about them.
This is my daughter Marcela.
What a sweet baby.
You must be very proud.
- Certainly.
Of course.
They can buy soon what they want, Jaimito.
Thank you, boss.
Can I have a glass of water?
- Of course.
Thank you.
And now you.
How are you?
- Well, you know.
Guys.
Well, Jaimito.
You wear it during your mission.
Thank you.
Really, Pablo?
Thank you.
What beautiful, say.
You must be careful and may not be noticed.
Of course.
I'll do anything you ask.
All right, boy.
Sit down.
These guys are going to explain to you what should be done.
Tomorrow morning you step the plane to Cali.
You need to record a conversation.
Quite simply.
Nothing to worry about.
Good.
How do you feel?
- I am very happy.
Thank you for this opportunity, Don Pablo.
And for the clothes.
I consider it an honor to work for you.
Thank you very much.
Do not mention it.
Good.
Come here and hug me.
Thank you, Don Pablo.
Thank you.
Good evening, madam.
- I wish you well.
Thank you.
See you later, guys.
Take care of yourself.
- Yeah.
Look, sweetheart.
What a nice jacket, right?
- Beautiful.
What did Pablo?
You know, we go higher.
You, me and the baby come up higher.
Thank you, my dear.
Look at that.
- Put on.
I have news about Gaviria.
They go to him en route to Cali kill.
Did you say Cali?
Can I have an interpreter?
Su?
Rez, listen.
I can interpret.
Wait, there's someone at the door.
'Tu puerta?
That's the door.
Pablo does not like if you talk to the DEA.
Su?
Rez.
Talk to me, asshole.
Su?
Rez, hello?
I want the recordings.
- Coming.
Carrillo and his men came to Tolu to kill Gacha.
Pe?
A hoped him alive to tackle.
It was her fault, Dad.
Do you still think that?
Let go, boy.
If she had said yes, I did it not to shoot.
Be a man.
Damn, they found us.
Come on, son.
Everything good?
- Nothing to worry about.
He tries to escape.
- That's him fail.
Bring me a radio, fast.
Correal, one radio.
Come on, Dad.
We go.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Stop.
Pe?
A, Gacha is in the red pickup.
What did I say?
We have escaped.
I'm afraid.
- What?
You're a wolf?
Yes, I am a wolf.
It is a helicopter.
They're going to kill us.
Nobody is going to kill us.
Do not talk nonsense.
Take this.
I see the pickup.
- Keep him on.
Do not let him escape.
Switch 's vehicle.
Did not work out.
We'll do it again.
Stop him.
Anyway.
Do not leave me alone, Dad.
- Never, boy.
Never.
Take a breath.
Would you like it, asshole?
Here, take this.
We are being shot.
We go to him of approaching the other side.
Do not worry, son.
Do not take chances.
He can not escape.
Understood.
Look outside.
What happens, Pe?
A?
We got him stopped.
He does not move.
Fredy?
We go.
Son.
You are a wolf.
Asshole.
Fredy, wake up.
Asshole.
What do you want?
What do you want?
Asshole.
What do you want?
He has no more bullets.
We can catch him alive.
You decide.
Shoot him at loggerheads.
Well, take position in and patrol the area again.
Everything good?
I can sleep tonight.
This was the first successful major surgery of Search Bloc.
The country and the world now understood that the fight against the narco's had reached new heights.
We are in good shape, according to recent polls.
We stand at a profit in six districts of Cali.
That are important in order to arrive in the lead.
The polls say nothing.
- I know.
The last time we dropped by five percent.
Yes.
Dr. Gaviria.
Stop him.
You may not pass.
Quiet, let him through.
Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?
He can not leave.
How so?
There awaits a bomb on him.
If he goes, he will die.
What are you talking about?
You decide.
But I know that something will happen.
Can you prove that?
I just feel it.
You just feel it.
And if you're wrong?
- I hope so huge.
But if I'm right?
Nervous?
A little, but I'm fine.
Wait here.
You know what to do?
Yes sir.
You should record the whole conversation.
Do not forget.
No sir.
- Good flight.
Will not you come?
No, I had to just hither bring the boss.
Do not worry.
I'll come tomorrow that way.
Good then.
- Do not be nervous.
Flying is great fun.
Well?
Go ahead.
The row is over there.
Good luck.
You tell me, Eduardo.
I lay me down to your decision.
Avianca, flight 203 to Cali is ready for boarding at gate six.
I follow your instincts.
I rule that he get out of here.
Stay with him.
Well ...
You and I are not the only ones worried.
Your belt, please.
Narcos 1x06:
Explosivos
Pablo's path was total war.
He established a bounty system for killing cops and over 200 were slaughtered.
The police had to build a special morgue just to hold the bodies.
The cops, they took vengeance.
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
OK, try it again and look at me.
I've already done it 17 times.
You got me and my wife into this.
Now sit down and do it again until you get it right.
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
What if they ask me a question about chemistry?
- I hope you're good at bullshitting.
- OK...
Sit down.
Do it again.
It's getting better.
We were protecting Elisa because she could tie Escobar to the Palace of Justice... but by protecting a communist, we were traitors.
Go figure.
Let's go.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Honey, thank you.
- You better help us get Escobar.
- I want him dead, too.
Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?
You clearly don't know your country's history in Latin America.
- Sorry, I didn't hear that...
- Honey, mellow out, OK?
Steve, I know you're mad, but this is the right thing to do.
The right thing to do?
I didn't have a choice in the matter, did I?
This is the only choice.
You should think about going back to Miami.
They're in their car.
Hold on.
Wow.
Maybe I will.
Just get in the car, OK?
OK, OK, they're on the move.
Go.
Go, go, go.
Should've never brought Connie down here.
She's not cut out for it.
- He's got that commie bitch with him.
- Don't do anything stupid.
Just keep your head down and this'll all be over soon enough.
We're gonna cut him off up here on the left.
Get out of the car, Murphy!
Get out!
- Step away from the vehicle.
- You following me?
- Move him away.
- Easy.
- Easy.
- Back!
- Come on.
Move the fuck back!
- Get your hands...
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey!
- You spying on me?
- Relax, Murphy!
Who the fuck were you talking to?
The fuck is she?
Stand down.
Who were you talking to, huh?
Peña.
I got wife troubles.
- Wife troubles.
- Yeah.
Your husband was clever to get them to follow him.
I hope he's OK.
Shit.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm American.
I don't speak Spanish.
Uh, documents.
Gracias, señor.
Hello?
OK, yes.
OK, you got her to the orphanage.
Good.
Elisa's fine.
Oh, God.
No, I'm just glad you're OK.
Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?
I want you to call me every other hour from the road.
Actually, call me every hour.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I love you, too.
I'm proud of you.
Bye.
Now that I knew Connie was safe, I could focus on César Gaviria.
At the time, the only thing more dangerous than being a Colombian cop was being a Colombian presidential candidate.
Mm-hm.
Gaviria had come out in favor of extraditing the narcos to the United States, and it was in our best interest that he win the presidency.
- But to win...
- Gracias.
...he had to survive until election day.
Uh, Señor Gaviria?
Through that door.
- You must be Agent Murphy.
- Hola.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
I'm Eduardo Sandoval, head of security of Dr. Gaviria.
What can we do for you?
I'm hoping that our agency can offer some resources to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.
Shouldn't the DEA be out chasing traffickers or is just my thought?
- I think the two coincide.
- Agent Murphy.
- Pleasure, sir.
- The pleasure is mine.
Please, have a seat.
Your Secret Service has briefed us on security measures.
No open-air speaking engagements, different routes home every day.
As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán, we needed an education on these things.
- Come on.
- Exactly.
These men will stop at nothing to kill you.
I'm aware of that.
And we're taking every precaution.
Your government even offers the use of an armored Cadillac limousine, built for your president.
The thing is that driving around in Bogotá with an American-made tank won't exactly endear us to the voters.
And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy, I'd say thank you.
Well, thank you.
And this?
What are we supposed to do with this?
Bullet-proof pants.
I suggest that you wear them.
Thank you, Agent Murphy, for your consideration.
And we'll keep in mind your advice.
Thank you for your time.
César Gaviria was riding a wave of public support for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.
But we had a target of our own:
José Rodríguez Gacha, who we tracked to Cartagena through one of our informants.
What do we got?
Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.
Who's this guy?
I don't know, but if Poison showed his face to pick him up, he must be really important.
Gaviria's life was on the line... my wife was with Colombia's most wanted fugitive, and my partner was in Cartagena.
He had his own mission, with a group of cops who had seen their friends and relatives die at the hands of Gacha.
Like Trujillo, whose father and two brothers, all cops, had died in gun battles with the cartel.
As hard as we were going after Gacha, the narcos wanted Gaviria.
It killed me to ask for help from this guy.
Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish, with none of the charm.
You don't call, you don't write.
I need to know who this is.
The fuck back!
Fuck back.
OK.
You know who he is?
Gonna tell me?
Gonna speak?
Yeah...
Suárez knew exactly who this guy was, and he wasn't the only one.
- Jesus Christ.
- Next time you wanna fuck somebody, take 'em on a date.
What's going on?
I have reason to believe the Medellín cartel is planning an imminent attack against Gaviria.
We have no intel to that effect.
Maybe you should do your job instead of spying on other agency personnel.
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing, Ambassador.
CIA's been so kind to give us these documents, but 90 percent of them are too classified for us to read.
I need to get into the White Room.
What's that?
Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.
You've been reading too many spy novels.
Spy novels...
Have you read The Spaniard?
Where the hell did you get that?
Ma'am, he has been in the country for several days.
He's been escorted by one of Pablo's top sicarios.
Let me see this.
I know the CIA has intel on this man.
Now, are you going to give me access or not?
Technically, the room isn't white.
It's more of a... burgundy.
- Agent Schroeder, will you join us?
- Mm-hm.
The White Room was a top secret repository for the CIA's deepest, darkest secrets.
So secret, in fact, that its very existence was never acknowledged.
Sit here.
Agent Schroeder will watch you the entire time.
Where are the files?
Gacha was always paranoid when things were quiet.
And now, he began to wonder about Navegante.
The Spaniard was a name that got everyone's attention.
He was a member of ETA.
Never heard of 'em?
They made bomb-making a goddamn art form.
They were a group of supposed freedom fighters from the Basque country, trying to secede from Spain.
Their specialty was targeted assassinations of public figures.
ETA was responsible for the assassination of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco, returning home from Christmas Mass... and a remote-controlled car bomb that killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.
The man behind those bombs?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.
Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez, a celebrity now, for hire.
Expensive, but the best.
'Cause Pablo only hires the best.
That was Pablo's plan, to blow up Gaviria.
The question was, where, when and how?
I appreciate your concern, Madam Ambassador, but canceling our campaign travel is not an option.
Well, given the new information that Agent Murphy has uncovered,
I hope you'll reconsider.
He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá, and a dozen other cities.
You are a target in every one.
Yes, and... we've done everything your Secret Service and Spain's Civil Guard have recommended.
We also have bomb-sniffing dogs at every campaign stop, so...
I think we're good.
You think the Spaniard doesn't know that?
Yes, I know.
But tell me, Agent Murphy, how do you expect him to win the election if he hides like a scared rabbit behind all this violence?
Tell me, how?
How do you expect him to win if he's dead?
I'm not telling your wife you died on my watch.
This is not your watch, OK?
Thank you, Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.
I'll take my chances.
Uh-huh.
"Tu puerta"?
- "Door."
- Door.
Suárez!
Suárez.
Suárez!
Talk to me, you bastard.
Suárez, hello?
Hello?
Hel...
- I want that call.
- Right away, sir.
Carrillo and his men arrived in Tolu to kill Gacha.
And Peña still hoped he could be taken alive.
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
I'll sleep tonight.
This was the first successful major operation by the Search Bloc.
It signaled to the country and to the world that the fight against the narcos had moved to a new level.
Dr. Gaviria!
- Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?
- No, no.
He can't go, no.
- What?
There's gonna be a bomb waiting.
He goes, he dies.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?
This is your job, your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.
Do you have proof?
I got my gut.
You got your gut.
- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.
What if I'm right?
I'll follow your gut this time.
Well... it seems like you and I are not the only ones afraid.
Stop!
OK!
- How are you?
- Very well.
How are you?
Your ID, please.
Certainly.
Give me that.
How many times have I told you not to throw the ball over there?
Are you trying to scare your sister or what?
- She's crying.
- Of course she's crying.
Don't you see she's just a baby?
You yourself were a baby not too long ago.
Yes, Dad.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What's wrong, Juan Pablo?
- I want her to die.
Never say that.
We are a family and we have to look out for each other, always.
You hear me?
Hello.
Cousin, Poison just took out some cops.
- Yes, go on.
How many?
- Two.
Yeah, but two what?
Sergeants or officers?
Officers.
You know Poison.
- Officers are a million each.
- OK, so two million?
- Yes, I'm writing it down here.
- OK, talk to you later.
All right.
What were you talking about?
Just business.
I want to be a businessman like you.
Pablo's path was total war.
He established a bounty system for killing cops and over 200 were slaughtered.
The police had to build a special morgue just to hold the bodies.
The cops, they took vengeance.
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
OK, try it again and look at me.
I've already done it 17 times.
You got me and my wife into this.
Now sit down and do it again until you get it right.
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
What if they ask me a question about chemistry?
- I hope you're good at bullshitting.
- OK...
Sit down.
Do it again.
It's getting better.
We were protecting Elisa because she could tie Escobar to the Palace of Justice... but by protecting a communist, we were traitors.
Go figure.
Let's go.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Honey, thank you.
- You better help us get Escobar.
- I want him dead, too.
Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?
You clearly don't know your country's history in Latin America.
- Sorry, I didn't hear that...
- Honey, mellow out, OK?
Steve, I know you're mad, but this is the right thing to do.
The right thing to do?
I didn't have a choice in the matter, did I?
This is the only choice.
You should think about going back to Miami.
They're in their car.
Hold on.
Wow.
Maybe I will.
Just get in the car, OK?
OK, OK, they're on the move.
Go.
Go, go, go.
Should've never brought Connie down here.
She's not cut out for it.
- He's got that commie bitch with him.
- Don't do anything stupid.
Just keep your head down and this'll all be over soon enough.
We're gonna cut him off up here on the left.
Get out of the car, Murphy!
Get out!
- Step away from the vehicle.
- You following me?
- Move him away.
- Easy.
- Easy.
- Back!
- Come on.
Move the fuck back!
- Get your hands...
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey!
- You spying on me?
- Relax, Murphy!
Who the fuck were you talking to?
The fuck is she?
Stand down.
Who were you talking to, huh?
Peña.
I got wife troubles.
- Wife troubles.
- Yeah.
Your husband was clever to get them to follow him.
I hope he's OK.
Shit.
Good morning, ladies.
Where are you headed?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm American.
I don't speak Spanish.
You speak Spanish?
Yes.
I asked where you are headed.
- Popayán.
- Popayán?
Your papers, please.
Uh, documents.
Ms. Connie Murphy.
Alba Borraga.
Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
- Be well.
Gracias, señor.
Hello?
OK, yes.
OK, you got her to the orphanage.
Good.
Elisa's fine.
Oh, God.
No, I'm just glad you're OK.
Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?
I want you to call me every other hour from the road.
Actually, call me every hour.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I love you, too.
I'm proud of you.
Bye.
Now that I knew Connie was safe, I could focus on César Gaviria.
At the time, the only thing more dangerous than being a Colombian cop was being a Colombian presidential candidate.
Mm-hm.
Gaviria had come out in favor of extraditing the narcos to the United States, and it was in our best interest that he win the presidency.
- But to win...
- Gracias.
...he had to survive until election day.
Uh, Señor Gaviria?
Through that door.
- You must be Agent Murphy.
- Hola.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
I'm Eduardo Sandoval, head of security of Dr. Gaviria.
What can we do for you?
I'm hoping that our agency can offer some resources to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.
Shouldn't the DEA be out chasing traffickers or is just my thought?
- I think the two coincide.
- Agent Murphy.
- Pleasure, sir.
- The pleasure is mine.
Please, have a seat.
Your Secret Service has briefed us on security measures.
No open-air speaking engagements, different routes home every day.
As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán, we needed an education on these things.
- Come on.
- Exactly.
These men will stop at nothing to kill you.
I'm aware of that.
And we're taking every precaution.
Your government even offers the use of an armored Cadillac limousine, built for your president.
The thing is that driving around in Bogotá with an American-made tank won't exactly endear us to the voters.
And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy, I'd say thank you.
Well, thank you.
And this?
What are we supposed to do with this?
Bullet-proof pants.
I suggest that you wear them.
Thank you, Agent Murphy, for your consideration.
And we'll keep in mind your advice.
Thank you for your time.
WITH GAVIRIA THERE WILL BE A FUTURE
César Gaviria was riding a wave of public support for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.
But we had a target of our own:
José Rodríguez Gacha, who we tracked to Cartagena through one of our informants.
Have you heard of this thing called a computer?
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.
It's a new kind of technology that's coming out.
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.
Hey, honey.
You look very beautiful today.
Relax, baby.
Relax.
We don't bite.
- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.
- Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.
I want to fuck her.
We have more important things to worry about right now, my son.
Understood?
Talk to me.
What do you know?
Don Gonzalo, we have people all over the property.
It's secure.
We've got a few men in town as well.
Now, what can you tell me about Medellín?
The same, boss.
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc is out looking for Pablo.
Thank you, Navegante.
- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.
Don Freddy.
Son... a question.
Are we sheep or are we wolves?
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves!
Right.
I like it.
They're in a house outside of Cartagena, right here.
Just know there are a lot of people guarding him.
Navegante, you've been working for Gacha for many years.
I'm sure in that time you've earned way more than we are giving you.
So tell me, why do you want to betray him?
That fucker's crazy.
He's gonna get us all killed.
I don't believe him one bit.
What do you care why he's doing it?
Because we have 23 agents with outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.
And he has twice as many men with brand new weapons.
And frankly...
I'm tired of sending young men to face certain death.
So then we have to be smart.
We have to create a trap.
If we catch him alive, he'll give us Escobar.
And the Ochoas.
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.
I want him dead.
He doesn't care about death.
He only fears rotting in jail.
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?
These aren't your men.
You have no family here to lose.
If this goes badly, there will be more widows and orphans, and I'll have to carry that on my shoulders.
Well...
I trust his information.
And I trust you.
But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.
What do we got?
Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.
Who's this guy?
I don't know, but if Poison showed his face to pick him up, he must be really important.
Here's your payment, sir.
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain on a cargo ship.
From there, our trucks will take it to the Basque country.
It's all set up.
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain on the first flight.
What's that?
As far as I know, you and my cousin have an agreement.
The agreement is for this amount.
What kind of bullshit is this?
5,000 kilos or no deal.
Then there is no deal.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Forgive my cousin, sir.
5,000 it is, then.
We shouldn't go.
I want you in the US.
You'll be safe there, far from all of this.
- What if something happens...
- Nothing is going to happen to me.
Let's go.
Please, protect him.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Come on, I'll walk you.
Bye, Daddy, I love you!
Gaviria's life was on the line... my wife was with Colombia's most wanted fugitive, and my partner was in Cartagena.
He had his own mission, with a group of cops who had seen their friends and relatives die at the hands of Gacha.
Like Trujillo, whose father and two brothers, all cops, had died in gun battles with the cartel.
As hard as we were going after Gacha, the narcos wanted Gaviria.
It killed me to ask for help from this guy.
Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish, with none of the charm.
- Hello, Suárez.
- Look who's here.
The Golden Gringo.
You don't call, you don't write.
I called your office.
I only speak to Peña.
I need to know who this is.
I need...
I need...
I need to know who he is.
"I need to know who he is."
Don't make me laugh, faggot.
"I need to know who he is."
The fuck back!
Fuck back.
OK.
You work for me, asshole!
Right?
Clear?
Is that clear?
You know who he is?
Gonna tell me?
Gonna speak?
Yeah...
Suárez knew exactly who this guy was, and he wasn't the only one.
- Jesus Christ.
- Next time you wanna fuck somebody, take 'em on a date.
What's going on?
I have reason to believe the Medellín cartel is planning an imminent attack against Gaviria.
We have no intel to that effect.
Maybe you should do your job instead of spying on other agency personnel.
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing, Ambassador.
CIA's been so kind to give us these documents, but 90 percent of them are too classified for us to read.
I need to get into the White Room.
What's that?
Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.
You've been reading too many spy novels.
Spy novels...
Have you read The Spaniard?
Where the hell did you get that?
Ma'am, he has been in the country for several days.
He's been escorted by one of Pablo's top sicarios.
Let me see this.
I know the CIA has intel on this man.
Now, are you going to give me access or not?
Technically, the room isn't white.
It's more of a... burgundy.
- Agent Schroeder, will you join us?
- Mm-hm.
The White Room was a top secret repository for the CIA's deepest, darkest secrets.
So secret, in fact, that its very existence was never acknowledged.
Sit here.
Agent Schroeder will watch you the entire time.
Where are the files?
I feel like he's still too soft.
He'll be fine.
I don't know, Pablo.
I feel like we need to suspend the operation.
- It's too delicate.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.
That's the reason your hair is falling out.
Very funny, motherfucker.
Keep laughing.
How's our boy doing, Mom?
He's learning, with a little tough love.
- What's up, Aunt?
- What's new?
That's so he can mix with the sons of the oligarchs, right?
- Yes, sir.
- So he can get us some information.
What about these clowns?
Are they treating you right?
More or less.
What do you mean "more or less"?
We treat you good.
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?
- Some rice?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Jaime.
Welcome to the family.
Thank you, boss.
Can't you do anything?
No.
While we're at war, we can't do anything.
This is bullshit.
People are turning up dead every day and my friends think my brothers are responsible.
Let's talk about something else, baby.
Yes.
All right, let's talk about running away together.
Let's get away while we can.
"Let's get away." Listen to this.
Why would you run away with a criminal like me?
And why not?
I wish it was that easy.
- Ah.
- I can't just leave like that.
I know.
You say that because of your wife.
I don't give a shit about my wife.
I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.
Who is the woman in that relationship?
You?
Gacha was always paranoid when things were quiet.
And now, he began to wonder about Navegante.
Hey, doll.
What are you doing?
I'm married, sir.
That's no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me.
Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.
What's up?
The Search Bloc is here, not in Medellín.
But Navegante said they were over there.
Navegante...
Navegante is a liar.
He wouldn't betray you.
Freddy... think, think.
Everyone in the world has a price.
All right, let's go!
They want war, we'll give them war!
The Spaniard was a name that got everyone's attention.
He was a member of Eta.
Never heard of 'em?

The man behind those bombs?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.
Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez, a celebrity now, for hire.
Expensive, but the best.
'Cause Pablo only hires the best.
That was Pablo's plan, to blow up Gaviria.
The question was, where, when and how?
I appreciate your concern, Madam Ambassador, but canceling our campaign travel is not an option.
Well, given the new information that Agent Murphy has uncovered,
I hope you'll reconsider.
He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá, and a dozen other cities.
You are a target in every one.
Yes, and... we've done everything your Secret Service and Spain's Civil Guard have recommended.
We also have bomb-sniffing dogs at every campaign stop, so...
I think we're good.
You think the Spaniard doesn't know that?
Yes, I know.
But tell me, Agent Murphy, how do you expect him to win the election if he hides like a scared rabbit behind all this violence?
Tell me, how?
How do you expect him to win if he's dead?
I'm not telling your wife you died on my watch.
This is not your watch, OK?
Thank you, Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.
I'll take my chances.
His name is Steve Murphy.
He's DEA.
I hope you'll pay for this information.
Suárez is talking to the DEA.
You know what you have to do.
He got away.
They killed the goddamn maid.
Colonel!
Colonel...
They called from the road block.
They have a car stopped and they're saying the driver's a senator.
- Does he have his identification?
- Everything checks out.
So what's the problem?
They found a machine gun in the trunk.
Let's go.
Look at my credentials.
No, I don't know this Gacha person you're referring to.
Why do you have a gun in the trunk?
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician in this country carries a weapon?
Please.
- It's my bodyguard's.
- Where's your bodyguard?
You're alone in the car, right?
Listen to me, officers... if you don't let me go immediately, you're going to regret it.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
- Give us a moment.
- Go on.
I don't believe him.
I don't either.
He could have bought his credentials.
What if it turns out he is a senator?
We'll pay for that.
I can't run that risk.
It's true.
You can't.
The next one...
goes in your head!
- All right, all right!
- Talk, bitch!
I'll talk, I'll talk!
I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.
You have a guest.
It's Don Pablo.
Hey, Jaime.
- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?
- Your family?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome.
Tell me about them.
This is my daughter Marcela.
Look at what a cute baby.
- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.
Of course.
Very soon, they will have the money to buy everything they want, Jaime.
Thanks a lot, boss.
- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.
Thank you.
- What about you?
- Good, sir.
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.
Guys.
All right, Jaime.
This is for you to wear during your mission.
Thank you, Ma'am.
Very kind.
Seriously, Pablo?
Thank you very much.
Everything is so beautiful.
You have to be very careful, and get by unnoticed.
For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.
All right, then, son.
Sit down.
These guys are going to give you very specific instructions.
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding the plane that is leaving for Cali.
We want you to record a conversation.
It's very simple, nothing to worry about.
All right.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm...
I'm very happy.
Thank you very much for the opportunity, Don Pablo.
Seriously.
And for the clothes.
Really, for me, it's an honor to work for you.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it.
OK.
Come here, give me a hug.
Thank you, Don Pablo.
Thank you.
- Ma'am, have a good night.
- Take care.
Thank you very much.
See you later, boys.
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.
My love, look!
- Look at this jacket.
Beautiful, right?
- It's beautiful.
What did Pablo say?
You know what?
We're going to get ahead.
You, me and the baby are going to get ahead.
Thank you, my love.
- Look at this.
- Let's go try it on.
I have some news about Gaviria.
They're going to kill him on the way to Cali.
Did you say Cali?
Hey, can I get a translate in here?
Suárez, OK.
I can translate.
Wait a moment.
Someone is at the door.
"Tu puerta"?
- "Door."
- Door.
Suárez!
Suárez.
Pablo doesn't like you talking to the DEA.
Suárez!
Talk to me, you bastard.
Suárez, hello?
Hello?
Hel...
- I want that call.
- Right away, sir.
Carrillo and his men arrived in Tolu to kill Gacha.
And Peña still hoped he could be taken alive.
It was her fault, Dad.
Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.
All she had to do was say yes and I wouldn't have had to shoot her!
Be a man!
Son of a bitch!
They found us!
Come on, son!
- Sir, are you OK?
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- He's trying to get away!
- He won't get away.
Get me a radio, quick!
Correal, bring a radio!
Correal!
A radio!
Dad, let's go!
Hurry, Dad, hurry!
Hurry!
Stop!
Peña!
Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!
What did I tell you?
We got out OK.
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?
You're a wolf, right?
Yes, I am a wolf.
It's a helicopter!
It's a helicopter!
They're going to kill us!
Nobody is going to kill us!
Don't talk like that!
Take this.
Take it!
- I have a Chevy in sight.
- Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
Try and disable the vehicle!
No good.
We're going in again.
Stop him!
Do whatever you have to do!
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- No, no.
Never, son, never!
Breathe!
Breathe!
Do you want this, asshole?
Do you want this?
We're taking fire!
We'll circle around and approach from another direction.
You don't need to worry about anything, my son.
Nothing.
Don't take any chances!
We can't afford to lose him!
Copy.
Look.
Look outside.
Look outside!
What's happening?
Peña, what's happening?
We stopped him.
He's not moving.
Freddy.
Freddy?
Let's go, Freddy.
Freddy?
Freddy?
Son!
You're a wolf.
You're a wolf.
Asshole!
Asshole!
Hey, asshole!
Freddy!
Wake up, Freddy!
Hey, asshole!
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Asshole!
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
He's out of bullets.
We can take him alive.
It's your call.
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
Give him lead.
Affirmative.
Maintain positions and patrol the area again.
Very good.
Are you OK?
I'll sleep tonight.
This was the first successful major operation by the Search Bloc.
It signaled to the country and to the world that the fight against the narcos had moved to a new level.
According to recent polls, we're doing well.
We're gaining points in six districts within Cali.
That's important, because it means we could pull ahead.
- Don't put too much faith in the polls.
- I know.
The last time, we fell five points in one day.
- Yes.
We...
- Dr. Gaviria!
Stop him!
Sir, we can't let you through!
Relax.
Let him through.
- Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?
- No, no.
He can't go, no.
- What?
There's gonna be a bomb waiting.
He goes, he dies.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?
This is your job, your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.
Do you have proof?
I got my gut.
You got your gut.
- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.
What if I'm right?
You nervous?
A little bit, but I'm fine.
Wait here, wait here.
You know what you have to do?
Yes, sir.
Remember, you have to record the entire conversation.
Don't forget.
- No, sir.
- Have a nice flight.
Aren't you coming with me?
No, the boss just told me to bring you here.
Hey, but don't worry.
Tomorrow, I'll come and meet you there.
- All right, then.
- All right.
Don't be nervous.
You'll see how fun it is to fly.
All right?
Go on.
The line is right there.
Good luck, then.
It's up to you, Eduardo.
Whatever you decide, I'll do.
Avianca announces the departure of Flight 203 to Cali, now boarding at Gate 6.
I'll follow your gut this time.
I'll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.
Well... it seems like you and I are not the only ones afraid.
Put on your seatbelt, please.
Stop!
OK!
- How are you?
- Very well.
How are you?
Your ID, please.
Certainly.
Give me that.
How many times have I told you not to throw the ball over there?
Are you trying to scare your sister or what?
- She's crying.
- Of course she's crying.
Don't you see she's just a baby?
You yourself were a baby not too long ago.
Yes, Dad.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What's wrong, Juan Pablo?
- I want her to die.
Never say that.
We are a family and we have to look out for each other, always.
You hear me?
Hello.
Cousin, Poison just took out some cops.
- Yes, go on.
How many?
- Two.
Yeah, but two what?
Sergeants or officers?
Officers.
You know Poison.
- Officers are a million each.
- OK, so two million?
- Yes, I'm writing it down here.
- OK, talk to you later.
All right.
What were you talking about?
Just business.
I want to be a businessman like you.
Pablo's path was total war.
He established a bounty system for killing cops and over 200 were slaughtered.
The police had to build a special morgue just to hold the bodies.
The cops, they took vengeance.
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
OK, try it again and look at me.
I've already done it 17 times.
You got me and my wife into this.
Now sit down and do it again until you get it right.
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
What if they ask me a question about chemistry?
- I hope you're good at bullshitting.
- OK...
Sit down.
Do it again.
It's getting better.
We were protecting Elisa because she could tie Escobar to the Palace of Justice... but by protecting a communist, we were traitors.
Go figure.
Let's go.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Honey, thank you.
- You better help us get Escobar.
- I want him dead, too.
Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?
You clearly don't know your country's history in Latin America.
- Sorry, I didn't hear that...
- Honey, mellow out, OK?
Steve, I know you're mad, but this is the right thing to do.
The right thing to do?
I didn't have a choice in the matter, did I?
This is the only choice.
You should think about going back to Miami.
They're in their car.
Hold on.
Wow.
Maybe I will.
Just get in the car, OK?
OK, OK, they're on the move.
Go.
Go, go, go.
Should've never brought Connie down here.
She's not cut out for it.
- He's got that commie bitch with him.
- Don't do anything stupid.
Just keep your head down and this'll all be over soon enough.
We're gonna cut him off up here on the left.
Get out of the car, Murphy!
Get out!
- Step away from the vehicle.
- You following me?
- Move him away.
- Easy.
- Easy.
- Back!
- Come on.
Move the fuck back!
- Get your hands...
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey!
- You spying on me?
- Relax, Murphy!
Who the fuck were you talking to?
The fuck is she?
Stand down.
Who were you talking to, huh?
Peña.
I got wife troubles.
- Wife troubles.
- Yeah.
Your husband was clever to get them to follow him.
I hope he's OK.
Shit.
Good morning, ladies.
Where are you headed?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm American.
I don't speak Spanish.
You speak Spanish?
Yes.
I asked where you are headed.
- Popayán.
- Popayán?
Your papers, please.
Uh, documents.
Ms. Connie Murphy.
Alba Borraga.
Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
- Be well.
Gracias, señor.
Hello?
OK, yes.
OK, you got her to the orphanage.
Good.
Elisa's fine.
Oh, God.
No, I'm just glad you're OK.
Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?
I want you to call me every other hour from the road.
Actually, call me every hour.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I love you, too.
I'm proud of you.
Bye.
Now that I knew Connie was safe, I could focus on César Gaviria.
At the time, the only thing more dangerous than being a Colombian cop was being a Colombian presidential candidate.
Mm-hm.
Gaviria had come out in favor of extraditing the narcos to the United States, and it was in our best interest that he win the presidency.
- But to win...
- Gracias.
...he had to survive until election day.
Uh, Señor Gaviria?
Through that door.
- You must be Agent Murphy.
- Hola.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
I'm Eduardo Sandoval, head of security of Dr. Gaviria.
What can we do for you?
I'm hoping that our agency can offer some resources to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.
Shouldn't the DEA be out chasing traffickers or is just my thought?
- I think the two coincide.
- Agent Murphy.
- Pleasure, sir.
- The pleasure is mine.
Please, have a seat.
Your Secret Service has briefed us on security measures.
No open-air speaking engagements, different routes home every day.
As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán, we needed an education on these things.
- Come on.
- Exactly.
These men will stop at nothing to kill you.
I'm aware of that.
And we're taking every precaution.
Your government even offers the use of an armored Cadillac limousine, built for your president.
The thing is that driving around in Bogotá with an American-made tank won't exactly endear us to the voters.
And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy, I'd say thank you.
Well, thank you.
And this?
What are we supposed to do with this?
Bullet-proof pants.
I suggest that you wear them.
Thank you, Agent Murphy, for your consideration.
And we'll keep in mind your advice.
Thank you for your time.
WITH GAVIRIA THERE WILL BE A FUTURE
César Gaviria was riding a wave of public support for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.
But we had a target of our own:
José Rodríguez Gacha, who we tracked to Cartagena through one of our informants.
Have you heard of this thing called a computer?
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.
It's a new kind of technology that's coming out.
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.
Hey, honey.
You look very beautiful today.
Relax, baby.
Relax.
We don't bite.
- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.
- Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.
I want to fuck her.
We have more important things to worry about right now, my son.
Understood?
Talk to me.
What do you know?
Don Gonzalo, we have people all over the property.
It's secure.
We've got a few men in town as well.
Now, what can you tell me about Medellín?
The same, boss.
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc is out looking for Pablo.
Thank you, Navegante.
- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.
Don Freddy.
Son... a question.
Are we sheep or are we wolves?
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves!
Right.
I like it.
They're in a house outside of Cartagena, right here.
Just know there are a lot of people guarding him.
Navegante, you've been working for Gacha for many years.
I'm sure in that time you've earned way more than we are giving you.
So tell me, why do you want to betray him?
That fucker's crazy.
He's gonna get us all killed.
I don't believe him one bit.
What do you care why he's doing it?
Because we have 23 agents with outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.
And he has twice as many men with brand new weapons.
And frankly...
I'm tired of sending young men to face certain death.
So then we have to be smart.
We have to create a trap.
If we catch him alive, he'll give us Escobar.
And the Ochoas.
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.
I want him dead.
He doesn't care about death.
He only fears rotting in jail.
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?
These aren't your men.
You have no family here to lose.
If this goes badly, there will be more widows and orphans, and I'll have to carry that on my shoulders.
Well...
I trust his information.
And I trust you.
But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.
What do we got?
Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.
Who's this guy?
I don't know, but if Poison showed his face to pick him up, he must be really important.
Here's your payment, sir.
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain on a cargo ship.
From there, our trucks will take it to the Basque country.
It's all set up.
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain on the first flight.
What's that?
As far as I know, you and my cousin have an agreement.
The agreement is for this amount.
What kind of bullshit is this?
5,000 kilos or no deal.
Then there is no deal.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Forgive my cousin, sir.
5,000 it is, then.
We shouldn't go.
I want you in the US.
You'll be safe there, far from all of this.
- What if something happens...
- Nothing is going to happen to me.
Let's go.
Please, protect him.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Come on, I'll walk you.
Bye, Daddy, I love you!
Gaviria's life was on the line... my wife was with Colombia's most wanted fugitive, and my partner was in Cartagena.
He had his own mission, with a group of cops who had seen their friends and relatives die at the hands of Gacha.
Like Trujillo, whose father and two brothers, all cops, had died in gun battles with the cartel.
As hard as we were going after Gacha, the narcos wanted Gaviria.
It killed me to ask for help from this guy.
Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish, with none of the charm.
- Hello, Suárez.
- Look who's here.
The Golden Gringo.
You don't call, you don't write.
I called your office.
I only speak to Peña.
I need to know who this is.
I need...
I need...
I need to know who he is.
"I need to know who he is."
Don't make me laugh, faggot.
"I need to know who he is."
The fuck back!
Fuck back.
OK.
You work for me, asshole!
Right?
Clear?
Is that clear?
You know who he is?
Gonna tell me?
Gonna speak?
Yeah...
Suárez knew exactly who this guy was, and he wasn't the only one.
- Jesus Christ.
- Next time you wanna fuck somebody, take 'em on a date.
What's going on?
I have reason to believe the Medellín cartel is planning an imminent attack against Gaviria.
We have no intel to that effect.
Maybe you should do your job instead of spying on other agency personnel.
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing, Ambassador.
CIA's been so kind to give us these documents, but 90 percent of them are too classified for us to read.
I need to get into the White Room.
What's that?
Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.
You've been reading too many spy novels.
Spy novels...
Have you read The Spaniard?
Where the hell did you get that?
Ma'am, he has been in the country for several days.
He's been escorted by one of Pablo's top sicarios.
Let me see this.
I know the CIA has intel on this man.
Now, are you going to give me access or not?
Technically, the room isn't white.
It's more of a... burgundy.
- Agent Schroeder, will you join us?
- Mm-hm.
The White Room was a top secret repository for the CIA's deepest, darkest secrets.
So secret, in fact, that its very existence was never acknowledged.
Sit here.
Agent Schroeder will watch you the entire time.
Where are the files?
I feel like he's still too soft.
He'll be fine.
I don't know, Pablo.
I feel like we need to suspend the operation.
- It's too delicate.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.
That's the reason your hair is falling out.
Very funny, motherfucker.
Keep laughing.
How's our boy doing, Mom?
He's learning, with a little tough love.
- What's up, Aunt?
- What's new?
That's so he can mix with the sons of the oligarchs, right?
- Yes, sir.
- So he can get us some information.
What about these clowns?
Are they treating you right?
More or less.
What do you mean "more or less"?
We treat you good.
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?
- Some rice?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Jaime.
Welcome to the family.
Thank you, boss.
Can't you do anything?
No.
While we're at war, we can't do anything.
This is bullshit.
People are turning up dead every day and my friends think my brothers are responsible.
Let's talk about something else, baby.
Yes.
All right, let's talk about running away together.
Let's get away while we can.
"Let's get away." Listen to this.
Why would you run away with a criminal like me?
And why not?
I wish it was that easy.
- Ah.
- I can't just leave like that.
I know.
You say that because of your wife.
I don't give a shit about my wife.
I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.
Who is the woman in that relationship?
You?
Gacha was always paranoid when things were quiet.
And now, he began to wonder about Navegante.
Hey, doll.
What are you doing?
I'm married, sir.
That's no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me.
Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.
What's up?
The Search Bloc is here, not in Medellín.
But Navegante said they were over there.
Navegante...
Navegante is a liar.
He wouldn't betray you.
Freddy... think, think.
Everyone in the world has a price.
All right, let's go!
They want war, we'll give them war!
The Spaniard was a name that got everyone's attention.
He was a member of Eta.
Never heard of 'em?
They made bomb-making a goddamn art form.
They were a group of supposed freedom fighters from the Basque country, trying to secede from Spain.
Their specialty was targeted assassinations of public figures.
Eta was responsible for the assassination of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco, returning home from Christmas Mass... and a remote-controlled car bomb that killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.
The man behind those bombs?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.
Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez, a celebrity now, for hire.
Expensive, but the best.
'Cause Pablo only hires the best.
That was Pablo's plan, to blow up Gaviria.
The question was, where, when and how?
I appreciate your concern, Madam Ambassador, but canceling our campaign travel is not an option.
Well, given the new information that Agent Murphy has uncovered,
I hope you'll reconsider.
He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá, and a dozen other cities.
You are a target in every one.
Yes, and... we've done everything your Secret Service and Spain's Civil Guard have recommended.
We also have bomb-sniffing dogs at every campaign stop, so...
I think we're good.
You think the Spaniard doesn't know that?
Yes, I know.
But tell me, Agent Murphy, how do you expect him to win the election if he hides like a scared rabbit behind all this violence?
Tell me, how?
How do you expect him to win if he's dead?
I'm not telling your wife you died on my watch.
This is not your watch, OK?
Thank you, Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.
I'll take my chances.
His name is Steve Murphy.
He's DEA.
I hope you'll pay for this information.
Suárez is talking to the DEA.
You know what you have to do.
He got away.
They killed the goddamn maid.
Colonel!
Colonel...
They called from the road block.
They have a car stopped and they're saying the driver's a senator.
- Does he have his identification?
- Everything checks out.
So what's the problem?
They found a machine gun in the trunk.
Let's go.
Look at my credentials.
No, I don't know this Gacha person you're referring to.
Why do you have a gun in the trunk?
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician in this country carries a weapon?
Please.
- It's my bodyguard's.
- Where's your bodyguard?
You're alone in the car, right?
Listen to me, officers... if you don't let me go immediately, you're going to regret it.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
- Give us a moment.
- Go on.
I don't believe him.
I don't either.
He could have bought his credentials.
What if it turns out he is a senator?
We'll pay for that.
I can't run that risk.
It's true.
You can't.
The next one...
goes in your head!
- All right, all right!
- Talk, bitch!
I'll talk, I'll talk!
I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.
You have a guest.
It's Don Pablo.
Hey, Jaime.
- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?
- Your family?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome.
Tell me about them.
This is my daughter Marcela.
Look at what a cute baby.
- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.
Of course.
Very soon, they will have the money to buy everything they want, Jaime.
Thanks a lot, boss.
- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.
Thank you.
- What about you?
- Good, sir.
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.
Guys.
All right, Jaime.
This is for you to wear during your mission.
Thank you, Ma'am.
Very kind.
Seriously, Pablo?
Thank you very much.
Everything is so beautiful.
You have to be very careful, and get by unnoticed.
For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.
All right, then, son.
Sit down.
These guys are going to give you very specific instructions.
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding the plane that is leaving for Cali.
We want you to record a conversation.
It's very simple, nothing to worry about.
All right.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm...
I'm very happy.
Thank you very much for the opportunity, Don Pablo.
Seriously.
And for the clothes.
Really, for me, it's an honor to work for you.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it.
OK.
Come here, give me a hug.
Thank you, Don Pablo.
Thank you.
- Ma'am, have a good night.
- Take care.
Thank you very much.
See you later, boys.
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.
My love, look!
- Look at this jacket.
Beautiful, right?
- It's beautiful.
What did Pablo say?
You know what?
We're going to get ahead.
You, me and the baby are going to get ahead.
Thank you, my love.
- Look at this.
- Let's go try it on.
I have some news about Gaviria.
They're going to kill him on the way to Cali.
Did you say Cali?
Hey, can I get a translate in here?
Suárez, OK.
I can translate.
Wait a moment.
Someone is at the door.
"Tu puerta"?
- "Door."
- Door.
Suárez!
Suárez.
Pablo doesn't like you talking to the DEA.
Suárez!
Talk to me, you bastard.
Suárez, hello?
Hello?
Hel...
- I want that call.
- Right away, sir.
Carrillo and his men arrived in Tolu to kill Gacha.
And Peña still hoped he could be taken alive.
It was her fault, Dad.
Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.
All she had to do was say yes and I wouldn't have had to shoot her!
Be a man!
Son of a bitch!
They found us!
Come on, son!
- Sir, are you OK?
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- He's trying to get away!
- He won't get away.
Get me a radio, quick!
Correal, bring a radio!
Correal!
A radio!
Dad, let's go!
Hurry, Dad, hurry!
Hurry!
Stop!
Peña!
Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!
What did I tell you?
We got out OK.
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?
You're a wolf, right?
Yes, I am a wolf.
It's a helicopter!
It's a helicopter!
They're going to kill us!
Nobody is going to kill us!
Don't talk like that!
Take this.
Take it!
- I have a Chevy in sight.
- Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
Try and disable the vehicle!
No good.
We're going in again.
Stop him!
Do whatever you have to do!
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- No, no.
Never, son, never!
Breathe!
Breathe!
Do you want this, asshole?
Do you want this?
We're taking fire!
We'll circle around and approach from another direction.
You don't need to worry about anything, my son.
Nothing.
Don't take any chances!
We can't afford to lose him!
Copy.
Look.
Look outside.
Look outside!
What's happening?
Peña, what's happening?
We stopped him.
He's not moving.
Freddy.
Freddy?
Let's go, Freddy.
Freddy?
Freddy?
Son!
You're a wolf.
You're a wolf.
Asshole!
Asshole!
Hey, asshole!
Freddy!
Wake up, Freddy!
Hey, asshole!
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Asshole!
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
He's out of bullets.
We can take him alive.
It's your call.
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
Give him lead.
Affirmative.
Maintain positions and patrol the area again.
Very good.
Are you OK?
I'll sleep tonight.
This was the first successful major operation by the Search Bloc.
It signaled to the country and to the world that the fight against the narcos had moved to a new level.
According to recent polls, we're doing well.
We're gaining points in six districts within Cali.
That's important, because it means we could pull ahead.
- Don't put too much faith in the polls.
- I know.
The last time, we fell five points in one day.
- Yes.
We...
- Dr. Gaviria!
Stop him!
Sir, we can't let you through!
Relax.
Let him through.
- Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?
- No, no.
He can't go, no.
- What?
There's gonna be a bomb waiting.
He goes, he dies.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?
This is your job, your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.
Do you have proof?
I got my gut.
You got your gut.
- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.
What if I'm right?
You nervous?
A little bit, but I'm fine.
Wait here, wait here.
You know what you have to do?
Yes, sir.
Remember, you have to record the entire conversation.
Don't forget.
- No, sir.
- Have a nice flight.
Aren't you coming with me?
No, the boss just told me to bring you here.
Hey, but don't worry.
Tomorrow, I'll come and meet you there.
- All right, then.
- All right.
Don't be nervous.
You'll see how fun it is to fly.
All right?
Go on.
The line is right there.
Good luck, then.
It's up to you, Eduardo.
Whatever you decide, I'll do.
Avianca announces the departure of Flight 203 to Cali, now boarding at Gate 6.
I'll follow your gut this time.
I'll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.
Well... it seems like you and I are not the only ones afraid.
Put on your seatbelt, please.
Stop!
OK!
- How are you?
- Very well.
How are you?
Your ID, please.
Certainly.
Give me that.
How many times have I told you not to throw the ball over there?
Are you trying to scare your sister or what?
- She's crying.
- Of course she's crying.
Don't you see she's just a baby?
You yourself were a baby not too long ago.
Yes, Dad.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What's wrong, Juan Pablo?
- I want her to die.
Never say that.
We are a family and we have to look out for each other, always.
- You hear me?
Hello.
Cousin, Poison just took out some cops.
- Yes, go on.
How many?
- Two.
Yeah, but two what?
Sergeants or officers?
Officers.
You know Poison.
- Officers are a million each.
- OK, so two million?
- Yes, I'm writing it down here.
- OK, talk to you later.
All right.
What were you talking about?
Just business.
I want to be a businessman like you.
Pablo's path was total war.
He established a bounty system for killing cops and over 200 were slaughtered.

The cops, they took vengeance.
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
OK, try it again and look at me.
I've already done it 17 times.
You got me and my wife into this.
Now sit down and do it again until you get it right.
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
What if they ask me a question about chemistry?
- I hope you're good at bullshitting.
- OK--
Sit down.
Do it again.
It's getting better.
We were protecting Elisa because she could tie Escobar to the Palace of Justice... but by protecting a communist, we were traitors.
Go figure.
Let's go.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Honey, thank you.
- You better help us get Escobar.
- I want him dead, too.
Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?
You clearly don't know your country's history in Latin America.
- Sorry, I didn't hear that--
- Honey, mellow out, OK?
Steve, I know you're mad, but this is the right thing to do.
The right thing to do?
I didn't have a choice in the matter, did I?
This is the only choice.
You should think about going back to Miami.
They're in their car.
Hold on.
Wow.
Maybe I will.
Just get in the car, OK?
OK, OK, they're on the move.
- Go.
Go, go, go.
Should've never brought Connie down here.
She's not cut out for it.
- He's got that commie bitch with him.
- Don't do anything stupid.
Just keep your head down and this'll all be over soon enough.
We're gonna cut him off up here on the left.
Get out of the car, Murphy!
Get out!
- Step away from the vehicle.
- You following me?
- Move him away.
- Easy.
- Easy.
- Back!
- Come on.
Move the fuck back!
- Get your hands--
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey!
- You spying on me?
- Relax, Murphy!
Who the fuck were you talking to?
The fuck is she?
Stand down.
Who were you talking to, huh?
Peña.
I got wife troubles.
- Wife troubles.
- Yeah.
Your husband was clever to get them to follow him.
I hope he's OK.
Shit.
Good morning, ladies.
Where are you headed?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm American.
I don't speak Spanish.
You speak Spanish?
Yes.
I asked where you are headed.
- Popayán.
- Popayán?
Your papers, please.
Uh, documents.
Ms. Connie Murphy.
Alba Borraga.
Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
- Be well.
Gracias, señor.
Hello?
OK, yes.
OK, you got her to the orphanage.
Good.
Elisa's fine.
Oh, God.
No, I'm just glad you're OK.
Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?
I want you to call me every other hour from the road.
Actually, call me every hour.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I love you, too.
I'm proud of you.
Bye.
Now that I knew Connie was safe, I could focus on César Gaviria.
At the time, the only thing more dangerous than being a Colombian cop was being a Colombian presidential candidate.
Mm-hm.
Gaviria had come out in favor of extraditing the narcos to the United States, and it was in our best interest that he win the presidency.
- But to win...
- Gracias.
...he had to survive until election day.
Uh, Señor Gaviria?
Through that door.
- You must be Agent Murphy.
- Hola.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
I'm Eduardo Sandoval, head of security of Dr. Gaviria.
What can we do for you?
I'm hoping that our agency can offer some resources to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.
Shouldn't the DEA be out chasing traffickers or is just my thought?
- I think the two coincide.
- Agent Murphy.
- Pleasure, sir.
- The pleasure is mine.
Please, have a seat.
Your Secret Service has briefed us on security measures.
No open-air speaking engagements, different routes home every day.
As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán, we needed an education on these things.
- Come on.
- Exactly.
These men will stop at nothing to kill you.
I'm aware of that.
And we're taking every precaution.
Your government even offers the use of an armored Cadillac limousine, built for your president.
The thing is that driving around in Bogotá with an American-made tank won't exactly endear us to the voters.
And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy, I'd say thank you.
Well, thank you.
And this?
What are we supposed to do with this?
Bullet-proof pants.
I suggest that you wear them.
Thank you, Agent Murphy, for your consideration.
And we'll keep in mind your advice.
Thank you for your time.
WITH GAVIRIA THERE WILL BE A FUTURE
César Gaviria was riding a wave of public support for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.
But we had a target of our own:
José Rodríguez Gacha, who we tracked to Cartagena through one of our informants.
Have you heard of this thing called a computer?
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.
It's a new kind of technology that's coming out.
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.
Hey, honey.
You look very beautiful today.
Relax, baby.
Relax.
We don't bite.
- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.
- Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.
I want to fuck her.
We have more important things to worry about right now, my son.
Understood?
Talk to me.
What do you know?
Don Gonzalo, we have people all over the property.
It's secure.
- We've got a few men in town as well.
Now, what can you tell me about Medellín?
The same, boss.
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc is out looking for Pablo.
Thank you, Navegante.
- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.
Don Freddy.
Son... a question.
Are we sheep or are we wolves?
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves!
Right.
I like it.
They're in a house outside of Cartagena, right here.
Just know there are a lot of people guarding him.
Navegante, you've been working for Gacha for many years.
I'm sure in that time you've earned way more than we are giving you.
So tell me, why do you want to betray him?
That fucker's crazy.
He's gonna get us all killed.
I don't believe him one bit.
What do you care why he's doing it?
Because we have 23 agents with outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.
And he has twice as many men with brand new weapons.
And frankly...
I'm tired of sending young men to face certain death.
So then we have to be smart.
We have to create a trap.
If we catch him alive, he'll give us Escobar.
And the Ochoas.
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.
I want him dead.
He doesn't care about death.
He only fears rotting in jail.
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?
These aren't your men.
You have no family here to lose.
If this goes badly, there will be more widows and orphans, and I'll have to carry that on my shoulders.
Well...
I trust his information.
And I trust you.
But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.
What do we got?
Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.
Who's this guy?
I don't know, but if Poison showed his face to pick him up, he must be really important.
Here's your payment, sir.
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain on a cargo ship.
From there, our trucks will take it to the Basque country.
It's all set up.
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain on the first flight.
What's that?
As far as I know, you and my cousin have an agreement.
The agreement is for this amount.
What kind of bullshit is this?
5,000 kilos or no deal.
Then there is no deal.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Forgive my cousin, sir.
5,000 it is, then.
We shouldn't go.
I want you in the US.
You'll be safe there, far from all of this.
- What if something happens--
- Nothing is going to happen to me.
Let's go.
Please, protect him.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Come on, I'll walk you.
Bye, Daddy, I love you!
Gaviria's life was on the line... my wife was with Colombia's most wanted fugitive, and my partner was in Cartagena.
He had his own mission, with a group of cops who had seen their friends and relatives die at the hands of Gacha.
Like Trujillo, whose father and two brothers, all cops, had died in gun battles with the cartel.
As hard as we were going after Gacha, the narcos wanted Gaviria.
It killed me to ask for help from this guy.
Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish, with none of the charm.
- Hello, Suárez.
- Look who's here.
The Golden Gringo.
You don't call, you don't write.
I called your office.
I only speak to Peña.
I need to know who this is.
I need...
I need...
I need to know who he is.
"I need to know who he is."
Don't make me laugh, faggot.
"I need to know who he is."
The fuck back!
Fuck back.
OK.
- You work for me, asshole!
- Right?
Clear?
Is that clear?
You know who he is?
Gonna tell me?
Gonna speak?
Yeah...
Suárez knew exactly who this guy was, and he wasn't the only one.
- Jesus Christ.
- Next time you wanna fuck somebody, take 'em on a date.
What's going on?
I have reason to believe the Medellín cartel is planning an imminent attack against Gaviria.
We have no intel to that effect.
Maybe you should do your job instead of spying on other agency personnel.
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing, Ambassador.
CIA's been so kind to give us these documents, but 90 percent of them are too classified for us to read.
I need to get into the White Room.
What's that?
Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.
You've been reading too many spy novels.
Spy novels...
Have you read The Spaniard?
Where the hell did you get that?
Ma'am, he has been in the country for several days.
He's been escorted by one of Pablo's top sicarios.
Let me see this.
I know the CIA has intel on this man.
Now, are you going to give me access or not?
Technically, the room isn't white.
It's more of a... burgundy.
- Agent Schroeder, will you join us?
- Mm-hm.
The White Room was a top secret repository for the CIA's deepest, darkest secrets.
So secret, in fact, that its very existence was never acknowledged.
Sit here.
Agent Schroeder will watch you the entire time.
Where are the files?
I feel like he's still too soft.
He'll be fine.
I don't know, Pablo.
I feel like we need to suspend the operation.
- It's too delicate.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.
That's the reason your hair is falling out.
- Very funny, motherfucker.
Keep laughing.
How's our boy doing, Mom?
He's learning, with a little tough love.
- What's up, Aunt?
- What's new?
That's so he can mix with the sons of the oligarchs, right?
- Yes, sir.
- So he can get us some information.
What about these clowns?
Are they treating you right?
More or less.
What do you mean "more or less"?
We treat you good.
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?
- Some rice?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Jaime.
Welcome to the family.
Thank you,boss.
Can't you do anything?
No.
While we're at war, we can't do anything.
This is bullshit.
People are turning up dead every day and my friends think my brothers are responsible.
Let's talk about something else, baby.
Yes.
All right, let's talk about running away together.
Let's get away while we can.
"Let's get away." Listen to this.
Why would you run away with a criminal like me?
And why not?
I wish it was that easy.
- Ah.
- I can't just leave like that.
I know.
- You say that because of your wife.
I don't give a shit about my wife.
I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.
Who is the woman in that relationship?
You?
Gacha was always paranoid when things were quiet.
And now, he began to wonder about Navegante.
Hey, doll.
What are you doing?
I'm married, sir.
That's no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me.
Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.
What's up?
The Search Bloc is here, not in Medellín.
But Navegante said they were over there.
Navegante...
Navegante is a liar.
He wouldn't betray you.
Freddy... think, think.
Everyone in the world has a price.
All right, let's go!
They want war, we'll give them war!
The Spaniard was a name that got everyone's attention.
He was a member of Eta.
Never heard of 'em?
They made bomb-making a goddamn art form.
They were a group of supposed freedom fighters from the Basque country, trying to secede from Spain.
Their specialty was targeted assassinations of public figures.
Eta was responsible for the assassination of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco, returning home from Christmas Mass... and a remote-controlled car bomb that killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.
The man behind those bombs?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.
Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez, a celebrity now, for hire.
Expensive, but the best.
'Cause Pablo only hires the best.
That was Pablo's plan, to blow up Gaviria.
The question was, where, when and how?
I appreciate your concern, Madam Ambassador, but canceling our campaign travel is not an option.
Well, given the new information that Agent Murphy has uncovered,
I hope you'll reconsider.
He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá, and a dozen other cities.
You are a target in every one.
Yes, and... we've done everything your Secret Service and Spain's Civil Guard have recommended.
We also have bomb-sniffing dogs at every campaign stop, so...
I think we're good.
You think the Spaniard doesn't know that?
Yes, I know.
But tell me, Agent Murphy, how do you expect him to win the election if he hides like a scared rabbit behind all this violence?
Tell me, how?
How do you expect him to win if he's dead?
I'm not telling your wife you died on my watch.
This is not your watch, OK?
Thank you, Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.
I'll take my chances.
His name is Steve Murphy.
He's DEA.
I hope you'll pay for this information.
Suárez is talking to the DEA.
You know what you have to do.
He got away.
They killed the goddamn maid.
Colonel!
Colonel...
They called from the road block.
They have a car stopped and they're saying the driver's a senator.
- Does he have his identification?
- Everything checks out.
So what's the problem?
They found a machine gun in the trunk.
Let's go.
Look at my credentials.
No, I don't know this Gacha person you're referring to.
Why do you have a gun in the trunk?
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician in this country carries a weapon?
Please.
- It's my bodyguard's.
- Where's your bodyguard?
You're alone in the car, right?
Listen to me, officers... if you don't let me go immediately, you're going to regret it.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
- Give us a moment.
- Go on.
I don't believe him.
I don't either.
He could have bought his credentials.
What if it turns out he is a senator?
We'll pay for that.
I can't run that risk.
It's true.
- You can't.
The next one...
goes in your head!
- All right, all right!
- Talk, bitch!
I'll talk, I'll talk!
I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.
You have a guest.
It's Don Pablo.
Hey, Jaime.
- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?
- Your family?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome.
Tell me about them.
This is my daughter Marcela.
- Look at what a cute baby.
- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.
Of course.
Very soon, they will have the money to buy everything they want, Jaime.
Thanks a lot, boss.
- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.
Thank you.
- What about you?
- Good, sir.
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.
Guys.
All right, Jaime.
This is for you to wear during your mission.
Thank you, Ma'am.
Very kind.
Seriously, Pablo?
Thank you very much.
Everything is so beautiful.
You have to be very careful, and get by unnoticed.
For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.
All right, then, son.
Sit down.
These guys are going to give you very specific instructions.
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding the plane that is leaving for Cali.
We want you to record a conversation.
It's very simple, nothing to worry about.
All right.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm...
I'm very happy.
Thank you very much for the opportunity, Don Pablo.
Seriously.
And for the clothes.
Really, for me, it's an honor to work for you.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it.
OK.
Come here, give me a hug.
Thank you, Don Pablo.
Thank you.
- Ma'am, have a good night.
- Take care.
Thank you very much.
See you later, boys.
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.
My love, look!
- Look at this jacket.
Beautiful, right?
- It's beautiful.
What did Pablo say?
You know what?
We're going to get ahead.
You, me and the baby are going to get ahead.
Thank you, my love.
- Look at this.
- Let's go try it on.
I have some news about Gaviria.
They're going to kill him on the way to Cali.
Did you say Cali?
Hey, can I get a translate in here?
Suárez, OK.
I can translate.
Wait a moment.
Someone is at the door.
"Tu puerta"?
- "Door."
- Door.
Suárez!
Suárez.
Pablo doesn't like you talking to the DEA.
Suárez!
Talk to me, you bastard.
Suárez, hello?
Hello?
Hel--
- I want that call.
- Right away, sir.
Carrillo and his men arrived in Tolu to kill Gacha.
And Peña still hoped he could be taken alive.
It was her fault, Dad.
Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.
All she had to do was say yes and I wouldn't have had to shoot her!
Be a man!
Son of a bitch!
They found us!
- Come on, son!
- Sir, are you OK?
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- He's trying to get away!
- He won't get away.
Get me a radio, quick!
Correal, bring a radio!
Correal!
A radio!
Dad, let's go!
Hurry, Dad, hurry!
Hurry!
Stop!
Peña!
Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!
What did I tell you?
We got out OK.
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?
You're a wolf, right?
Yes, I am a wolf.
It's a helicopter!
It's a helicopter!
They're going to kill us!
Nobody is going to kill us!
Don't talk like that!
Take this.
Take it!
- I have a Chevy in sight.
- Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
Try and disable the vehicle!
No good.
We're going in again.
Stop him!
Do whatever you have to do!
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- No, no.
Never, son, never!
Breathe!
Breathe!
Do you want this, asshole?
- Do you want this?
We're taking fire!
We'll circle around and approach from another direction.
You don't need to worry about anything, my son.
Nothing.
Don't take any chances!
We can't afford to lose him!
Copy.
Look.
Look outside.
Look outside!
What's happening?
Peña, what's happening?
We stopped him.
He's not moving.
Freddy.
Freddy?
Let's go, Freddy.
Freddy?
Freddy?
Son!
You're a wolf.
You're a wolf.
Asshole!
Asshole!
Hey, asshole!
Freddy!
Wake up, Freddy!
- Hey, asshole!
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Asshole!
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
He's out of bullets.
We can take him alive.
It's your call.
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
Give him lead.
Affirmative.
Maintain positions and patrol the area again.
Very good.
Are you OK?
I'll sleep tonight.
This was the first successful major operation by the Search Bloc.
It signaled to the country and to the world that the fight against the narcos had moved to a new level.
According to recent polls, we're doing well.
We're gaining points in six districts within Cali.
That's important, because it means we could pull ahead.
- Don't put too much faith in the polls.
- I know.
The last time, we fell five points in one day.
- Yes.
We--
- Dr. Gaviria!
Stop him!
Sir, we can't let you through!
Relax.
Let him through.
- Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?
- No, no.
He can't go, no.
- What?
There's gonna be a bomb waiting.
He goes, he dies.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?
This is your job, your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.
Do you have proof?
- I got my gut.
You got your gut.
- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.
What if I'm right?
You nervous?
A little bit, but I'm fine.
Wait here, wait here.
You know what you have to do?
Yes, sir.
Remember, you have to record the entire conversation.
Don't forget.
- No, sir.
- Have a nice flight.
Aren't you coming with me?
No, the boss just told me to bring you here.
Hey, but don't worry.
Tomorrow, I'll come and meet you there.
- All right, then.
- All right.
Don't be nervous.
You'll see how fun it is to fly.
All right?
Go on.
The line is right there.
Good luck, then.
It's up to you, Eduardo.
Whatever you decide, I'll do.
Avianca announces the departure of Flight 203 to Cali, now boarding at Gate 6.
I'll follow your gut this time.
I'll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.
Well... it seems like you and I are not the only ones afraid.
Put on your seatbelt, please.
[guard in Spanish] Stop!
[chatter in Spanish]
OK!
- How are you?
- Very well.
How are you?
Your ID, please.
Certainly.
[indistinct radio chatter] [baby crying nearby] [in Spanish] Give me that.
How many times have I told you not to throw the ball over there?
Are you trying to scare your sister or what?
- She's crying.
- Of course she's crying.
Don't you see she's just a baby?
You yourself were a baby not too long ago.
Yes, Dad.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What's wrong, Juan Pablo?
- I want her to die.
Never say that.
We are a family and we have to look out for each other, always.
- You hear me?
- [phone ringing]
Hello.
[Gustavo] Cousin, Poison just took out some cops.
- Yes, go on.
How many?
- Two.
Yeah, but two what?
Sergeants or officers?
Officers.
You know Poison.
- Officers are a million each.
- OK, so two million?
- Yes, I'm writing it down here.
- OK, talk to you later.
All right.
What were you talking about?
Just business.
I want to be a businessman like you.
[sighs]
[Latin guitar theme music plays]
[Steve] Pablo's path was total war.
He established a bounty system for killing cops and over 200 were slaughtered.
The police had to build a special morgue just to hold the bodies.
The cops, they took vengeance.
[in English] My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
OK, try it again and look at me.
I've already done it 17 times.
You got me and my wife into this.
Now sit down and do it again until you get it right.
[Elisa sighs]
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
What if they ask me a question about chemistry?
- I hope you're good at bullshitting.
- OK...
Sit down.
Do it again.
It's getting better.
[Steve] We were protecting Elisa because she could tie Escobar to the Palace of Justice... but by protecting a communist, we were traitors.
Go figure.
Let's go.
- [Connie] Are you ready?
- [Elisa] Yes.
[Steve sighs]
Honey, thank you.
- You better help us get Escobar.
- I want him dead, too.
Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?
You clearly don't know your country's history in Latin America.
- Sorry, I didn't hear that...
- Honey, mellow out, OK?
Steve, I know you're mad, but this is the right thing to do.
The right thing to do?
I didn't have a choice in the matter, did I?
[Connie] This is the only choice.
[Steve sighs] You should think about going back to Miami.
They're in their car.
Hold on.
Wow.
Maybe I will.
Just get in the car, OK?
[car door slams, engine starts over radio]
OK, OK, they're on the move.
- Go.
Go, go, go.
- [engine starting]
Should've never brought Connie down here.
She's not cut out for it.
- He's got that commie bitch with him.
- [Steve] Don't do anything stupid.
Just keep your head down and this'll all be over soon enough.
We're gonna cut him off up here on the left.
[tires screeching]
Get out of the car, Murphy!
Get out!
- Step away from the vehicle.
- You following me?
- Move him away.
- [Steve] Easy.
- Easy.
- Back!
- Come on.
Move the fuck back!
- Get your hands...
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- [Lou] Hey!
- You spying on me?
- Relax, Murphy!
Who the fuck were you talking to?
The fuck is she?
Stand down.
Who were you talking to, huh?
Peña.
I got wife troubles.
- Wife troubles.
- Yeah.
[Elisa] Your husband was clever to get them to follow him.
I hope he's OK.
Shit.
[in Spanish] Good morning, ladies.
Where are you headed?
[in English] I'm sorry, sir.
I'm American.
I don't speak Spanish.
[in Spanish] You speak Spanish?
Yes.
I asked where you are headed.
- Popayán.
- Popayán?
Your papers, please.
[in English] Uh, documents.
[in Spanish] Ms. Connie Murphy.
Alba Borraga.
Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
- Be well.
Gracias, señor.
[starts engine] [indistinct chatter in Spanish]
[phone ringing]
Hello?
[sighing]
OK, yes.
OK, you got her to the orphanage.
Good.
Elisa's fine.
Oh, God.
No, I'm just glad you're OK.
Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?
I want you to call me every other hour from the road.
Actually, call me every hour.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I love you, too.
I'm proud of you.
Bye.
[Steve] Now that I knew Connie was safe, I could focus on César Gaviria.
At the time, the only thing more dangerous than being a Colombian cop was being a Colombian presidential candidate.
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]
- [metal detector beeps] - [overlapping chatter in Spanish]
Mm-hm.
[Steve] Gaviria had come out in favor of extraditing the narcos to the United States, and it was in our best interest that he win the presidency.
- But to win...
- Gracias.
...he had to survive until election day.
Uh, Señor Gaviria?
[woman in English] Through that door.
- [in English] You must be Agent Murphy.
- Hola.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
I'm Eduardo Sandoval, head of security of Dr. Gaviria.
What can we do for you?
I'm hoping that our agency can offer some resources to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.
Shouldn't the DEA be out chasing traffickers or is just my thought?
- I think the two coincide.
- Agent Murphy.
- Pleasure, sir.
- The pleasure is mine.
Please, have a seat.
Your Secret Service has briefed us on security measures.
No open-air speaking engagements, different routes home every day.
As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán, we needed an education on these things.
- Come on.
- Exactly.
These men will stop at nothing to kill you.
I'm aware of that.
And we're taking every precaution.
Your government even offers the use of an armored Cadillac limousine, built for your president.
The thing is that driving around in Bogotá with an American-made tank won't exactly endear us to the voters.
And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy, I'd say thank you.
Well, thank you.
And this?
What are we supposed to do with this?
Bullet-proof pants.
I suggest that you wear them.
Thank you, Agent Murphy, for your consideration.
And we'll keep in mind your advice.
Thank you for your time.
WITH GAVIRIA THERE WILL BE A FUTURE
[Steve] César Gaviria was riding a wave of public support for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.
But we had a target of our own:
José Rodríguez Gacha, who we tracked to Cartagena through one of our informants.
[Gacha in Spanish] Have you heard of this thing called a computer?
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.
[boy] It's a new kind of technology that's coming out.
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.
Hey, honey.
You look very beautiful today.
Relax, baby.
Relax.
We don't bite. [chuckles]
- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.
- [Gacha] Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.
I want to fuck her.
We have more important things to worry about right now, my son.
Understood?
Talk to me.
What do you know?
Don Gonzalo, we have people all over the property.
It's secure.
- We've got a few men in town as well.
- [grunts]
Now, what can you tell me about Medellín?
The same, boss.
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc is out looking for Pablo.
[Gacha] Thank you, Navegante.
- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.
Don Freddy.
Son... a question.
Are we sheep or are we wolves?
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves!
Right.
I like it.
[Navegante in Spanish] They're in a house outside of Cartagena, right here.
Just know there are a lot of people guarding him.
Navegante, you've been working for Gacha for many years.
I'm sure in that time you've earned way more than we are giving you.
So tell me, why do you want to betray him?
That fucker's crazy.
He's gonna get us all killed.
I don't believe him one bit.
What do you care why he's doing it?
Because we have 23 agents with outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.
And he has twice as many men with brand new weapons.
And frankly...
I'm tired of sending young men to face certain death.
So then we have to be smart.
We have to create a trap.
If we catch him alive, he'll give us Escobar.
And the Ochoas.
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.
I want him dead.
He doesn't care about death.
He only fears rotting in jail.
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?
These aren't your men.
You have no family here to lose.
If this goes badly, there will be more widows and orphans, and I'll have to carry that on my shoulders.
Well...
I trust his information.
And I trust you.
But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.
[in English] What do we got?
Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.
Who's this guy?
I don't know, but if Poison showed his face to pick him up, he must be really important.
[Gustavo in Spanish] Here's your payment, sir.
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain on a cargo ship.
From there, our trucks will take it to the Basque country.
It's all set up.
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain on the first flight.
[Gustavo] What's that?
As far as I know, you and my cousin have an agreement.
The agreement is for this amount.
What kind of bullshit is this?
5,000 kilos or no deal.
Then there is no deal.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Forgive my cousin, sir.
5,000 it is, then.
[Ana] We shouldn't go.
I want you in the US.
You'll be safe there, far from all of this.
- What if something happens...
- Nothing is going to happen to me.
Let's go.
Please, protect him.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Come on, I'll walk you.
- [engine starting] - [indistinct chatter in Spanish] [boy] Bye, Daddy, I love you!
[chatter in Spanish]
[Steve] Gaviria's life was on the line... my wife was with Colombia's most wanted fugitive, and my partner was in Cartagena.
He had his own mission, with a group of cops who had seen their friends and relatives die at the hands of Gacha.
Like Trujillo, whose father and two brothers, all cops, had died in gun battles with the cartel.
As hard as we were going after Gacha, the narcos wanted Gaviria.
- [up-tempo Latin music playing] - [indistinct chatter in Spanish]
It killed me to ask for help from this guy.
Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish, with none of the charm.
- [in Spanish] Hello, Suárez.
- Look who's here.
The Golden Gringo.
[in English] You don't call, you don't write.
[in Spanish] I called your office.
I only speak to Peña.
[in English] I need to know who this is.
[in Spanish] I need...
I need...
I need to know who he is.
[laughing] [mocking in Spanish] "I need to know who he is."
Don't make me laugh, faggot.
"I need to know who he is."
[in English] The fuck back!
Fuck back.
[man in Spanish] OK.
- [in Spanish] You work for me, asshole!
- [grunting]
- Right?
Clear?
Is that clear?
- [loud whimpering] [in English] You know who he is?
Gonna tell me?
Gonna speak?
Yeah...
[Steve] Suárez knew exactly who this guy was, and he wasn't the only one.
- Jesus Christ.
- Next time you wanna fuck somebody, take 'em on a date.
What's going on?
I have reason to believe the Medellín cartel is planning an imminent attack against Gaviria.
We have no intel to that effect.
Maybe you should do your job instead of spying on other agency personnel.
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing, Ambassador.
CIA's been so kind to give us these documents, but 90 percent of them are too classified for us to read.
I need to get into the White Room.
What's that?
Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.
[chuckling] You've been reading too many spy novels.
Spy novels...
Have you read The Spaniard?
[Lou] Where the hell did you get that?
Ma'am, he has been in the country for several days.
He's been escorted by one of Pablo's top sicarios.
Let me see this.
[Steve] I know the CIA has intel on this man.
Now, are you going to give me access or not?
Technically, the room isn't white.
It's more of a... burgundy.
[indistinct radio chatter]
- Agent Schroeder, will you join us?
- Mm-hm.
[Steve] The White Room was a top secret repository for the CIA's deepest, darkest secrets.
So secret, in fact, that its very existence was never acknowledged.
[lock clicks]
Sit here.
Agent Schroeder will watch you the entire time.
Where are the files?
[door buzzes]
[Latin music plays on radio]
[Gustavo in Spanish] I feel like he's still too soft.
[Pablo] He'll be fine.
I don't know, Pablo.
I feel like we need to suspend the operation.
- It's too delicate.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.
That's the reason your hair is falling out. [chuckles]
- Very funny, motherfucker.
- [laughing]
[Gustavo scoffs]
Keep laughing.
How's our boy doing, Mom?
He's learning, with a little tough love.
- What's up, Aunt?
- What's new?
That's so he can mix with the sons of the oligarchs, right?
- Yes, sir.
- So he can get us some information.
What about these clowns?
Are they treating you right?
More or less.
What do you mean "more or less"?
We treat you good.
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?
- Some rice?
- [Gustavo] Yes.
[sighs]
Thank you.
Jaime.
Welcome to the family.
Thank you, boss.
Can't you do anything?
[Gustavo] No.
While we're at war, we can't do anything.
This is bullshit.
People are turning up dead every day and my friends think my brothers are responsible.
Let's talk about something else, baby.
Yes.
All right, let's talk about running away together.
Let's get away while we can.
[chuckles softly]
"Let's get away." Listen to this.
[Marina sighs]
Why would you run away with a criminal like me?
And why not?
[scoffs]
I wish it was that easy.
- Ah.
- I can't just leave like that.
I know.
- You say that because of your wife.
- [sighs]
I don't give a shit about my wife.
I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.
[dry chuckle]
Who is the woman in that relationship?
You?
[Steve] Gacha was always paranoid when things were quiet.
And now, he began to wonder about Navegante.
[in Spanish] Hey, doll.
What are you doing?
I'm married, sir.
That's no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me.
Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.
What's up?
The Search Bloc is here, not in Medellín.
But Navegante said they were over there.
Navegante...
Navegante is a liar.
He wouldn't betray you.
Freddy... think, think.
Everyone in the world has a price.
[shouting] All right, let's go!
They want war, we'll give them war!
[men shouting eagerly in Spanish]
[sighs]
[Steve] The Spaniard was a name that got everyone's attention.
He was a member of Eta.
Never heard of 'em?
They made bomb-making a goddamn art form.
They were a group of supposed freedom fighters from the Basque country, trying to secede from Spain.
Their specialty was targeted assassinations of public figures.
- [indistinct radio chatter] - [sirens wailing]
Eta was responsible for the assassination of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco, returning home from Christmas Mass... and a remote-controlled car bomb that killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.
The man behind those bombs?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.
Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez, a celebrity now, for hire.
Expensive, but the best.
'Cause Pablo only hires the best.
That was Pablo's plan, to blow up Gaviria.
The question was, where, when and how?
[in English] I appreciate your concern, Madam Ambassador, but canceling our campaign travel is not an option.
Well, given the new information that Agent Murphy has uncovered,
I hope you'll reconsider.
He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá, and a dozen other cities.
You are a target in every one.
Yes, and... we've done everything your Secret Service and Spain's Civil Guard have recommended.
We also have bomb-sniffing dogs at every campaign stop, so...
I think we're good.
You think the Spaniard doesn't know that?
Yes, I know.
But tell me, Agent Murphy, how do you expect him to win the election if he hides like a scared rabbit behind all this violence?
Tell me, how?
How do you expect him to win if he's dead?
I'm not telling your wife you died on my watch.
This is not your watch, OK?
Thank you, Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.
I'll take my chances.
[in Spanish] His name is Steve Murphy.
He's DEA.
I hope you'll pay for this information.
[slow Latin music playing] [sighs]
Suárez is talking to the DEA.
You know what you have to do.
[in Spanish] He got away.
They killed the goddamn maid.
[man] Colonel!
Colonel...
They called from the road block.
They have a car stopped and they're saying the driver's a senator.
- Does he have his identification?
- Everything checks out.
So what's the problem?
They found a machine gun in the trunk.
Let's go.
Look at my credentials.
No, I don't know this Gacha person you're referring to.
Why do you have a gun in the trunk?
[chuckles]
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician in this country carries a weapon?
Please.
- It's my bodyguard's.
- Where's your bodyguard?
You're alone in the car, right?
Listen to me, officers... if you don't let me go immediately, you're going to regret it.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
- Give us a moment.
- Go on.
[softly] I don't believe him.
I don't either.
He could have bought his credentials.
What if it turns out he is a senator?
We'll pay for that.
I can't run that risk.
It's true.
- You can't.
- [chambers round, fires] [screams]
The next one...
goes in your head!
- All right, all right!
- Talk, bitch!
I'll talk, I'll talk!
[in Spanish] I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.
You have a guest.
It's Don Pablo.
[knocking]
Hey, Jaime.
- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?
- Your family?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome.
Tell me about them.
This is my daughter Marcela.
- Look at what a cute baby.
- [chuckles]
- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.
Of course.
Very soon, they will have the money to buy everything they want, Jaime.
Thanks a lot, boss.
- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.
Thank you.
- What about you?
- Good, sir.
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.
Guys.
All right, Jaime.
This is for you to wear during your mission.
Thank you, Ma'am.
Very kind.
Seriously, Pablo?
Thank you very much.
Everything is so beautiful.
You have to be very careful, and get by unnoticed.
For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.
All right, then, son.
Sit down.
These guys are going to give you very specific instructions.
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding the plane that is leaving for Cali.
We want you to record a conversation.
It's very simple, nothing to worry about.
All right.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm...
I'm very happy.
Thank you very much for the opportunity, Don Pablo.
Seriously.
And for the clothes.
Really, for me, it's an honor to work for you.
Thank you very much.
[softly] Don't mention it.
OK.
Come here, give me a hug.
Thank you, Don Pablo.
Thank you.
- Ma'am, have a good night.
- [woman] Take care.
Thank you very much.
See you later, boys.
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.
My love, look!
- Look at this jacket.
Beautiful, right?
- It's beautiful.
What did Pablo say?
You know what?
We're going to get ahead.
You, me and the baby are going to get ahead.
Thank you, my love.
- Look at this.
- Let's go try it on.
[in Spanish] I have some news about Gaviria.
They're going to kill him on the way to Cali.
[in English] Did you say Cali?
Hey, can I get a translate in here?
Suárez, OK.
I can translate.
[knocking at door] [in Spanish] Wait a moment.
Someone is at the door.
[stammers] "Tu puerta"?
- "Door."
- Door.
Suárez!
Suárez.
- [gunshot] - [screaming] [in Spanish] Pablo doesn't like you talking to the DEA.
[Steve over phone] Suárez!
Talk to me, you bastard.
Suárez, hello?
Hello?
Hel...
- I want that call.
- Right away, sir.
[Steve] Carrillo and his men arrived in Tolu to kill Gacha.
And Peña still hoped he could be taken alive.
[in Spanish] It was her fault, Dad.
Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.
All she had to do was say yes and I wouldn't have had to shoot her!
Be a man!
[man zips pants] [grunts] [shouts] Son of a bitch!
They found us!
- [automatic gunfire] - [overlapping shouts in Spanish]
[screams]
- Come on, son!
- [overlapping gunfire continues]
[men shouting]
[gunfire continues]
- [battle sounds muted] - [high-pitched tone] [grunts]
[sounds returning] [indistinct shouts in Spanish]
- Sir, are you OK?
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- He's trying to get away!
- He won't get away.
Get me a radio, quick!
Correal, bring a radio!
Correal!
A radio!
Dad, let's go!
Hurry, Dad, hurry!
Hurry!
[gunfire continues]
[man in Spanish] Stop!
[grunts]
Peña!
Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!
[chuckles]
What did I tell you?
We got out OK.
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?
You're a wolf, right?
Yes, I am a wolf.
[Freddy] It's a helicopter!
It's a helicopter!
They're going to kill us!
Nobody is going to kill us!
Don't talk like that!
Take this.
Take it!
- I have a Chevy in sight.
- Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
Try and disable the vehicle!
- [indistinct chatter over radio] - [man readies weapon]
[Javier] No good.
We're going in again.
Stop him!
Do whatever you have to do!
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- No, no.
Never, son, never!
Breathe!
Breathe!
Do you want this, asshole?
- Do you want this?
- [gunshots]
[Javier] We're taking fire!
We'll circle around and approach from another direction.
You don't need to worry about anything, my son.
Nothing.
[Carrillo] Don't take any chances!
We can't afford to lose him!
Copy.
Look.
Look outside.
Look outside!
[Carrillo] What's happening?
Peña, what's happening?
[Javier] We stopped him.
He's not moving.
Freddy.
Freddy?
Let's go, Freddy.
Freddy?
Freddy?
Son!
[soft whimper] [helicopter blades thumping above] [whispers] You're a wolf.
You're a wolf.
Asshole!
Asshole!
Hey, asshole!
Freddy!
Wake up, Freddy!
- Hey, asshole!
What are you gonna do?
- [gun clicks]
What are you gonna do?
Asshole!
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
[indistinct radio chatter]
[Javier] He's out of bullets.
We can take him alive.
[Carrillo] It's your call.
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
Give him lead.
[screams]
- [gunfire continues] - [shell casings clinking] [gunfire ceases]
Affirmative.
Maintain positions and patrol the area again.
Very good.
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]
Are you OK?
[in English] I'll sleep tonight.
[Steve] This was the first successful major operation by the Search Bloc.
It signaled to the country and to the world that the fight against the narcos had moved to a new level.
[in Spanish] According to recent polls, we're doing well.
We're gaining points in six districts within Cali.
That's important, because it means we could pull ahead.
- Don't put too much faith in the polls.
- I know.
The last time, we fell five points in one day.
- Yes.
We...
- [Steve] Dr. Gaviria!
Stop him!
Sir, we can't let you through!
[Eduardo] Relax.
Let him through.
- [in English] Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?
- [panting] No, no.
He can't go, no.
- What?
There's gonna be a bomb waiting.
He goes, he dies.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?
This is your job, your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.
Do you have proof?
- I got my gut.
- [scoffs]
You got your gut.
- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.
What if I'm right?
[in Spanish] You nervous?
[Jaime] A little bit, but I'm fine.
[softly] Wait here, wait here.
You know what you have to do?
Yes, sir.
Remember, you have to record the entire conversation.
Don't forget.
- No, sir.
- Have a nice flight.
Aren't you coming with me?
No, the boss just told me to bring you here.
Hey, but don't worry.
Tomorrow, I'll come and meet you there.
- All right, then.
- All right.
Don't be nervous.
You'll see how fun it is to fly.
All right?
Go on.
The line is right there.
Good luck, then.
[in Spanish] It's up to you, Eduardo.
Whatever you decide, I'll do.
[woman over PA] Avianca announces the departure of Flight 203 to Cali, now boarding at Gate 6.
[in English] I'll follow your gut this time.
[in Spanish] I'll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.
[in English] Well... it seems like you and I are not the only ones afraid.
[sighs] [in Spanish] Put on your seatbelt, please.
[seatbelt clicks]
[indistinct announcements over PA]
[indistinct conversation in Spanish]
[guard in Spanish] Stop!
[chatter in Spanish]
OK!
- How are you?
- Very well.
How are you?
Your ID, please.
Certainly.
[indistinct radio chatter] [baby crying nearby] [in Spanish] Give me that.
How many times have I told you not to throw the ball over there?
Are you trying to scare your sister or what?
- She's crying.
- Of course she's crying.
Don't you see she's just a baby?
You yourself were a baby not too long ago.
Yes, Dad.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What's wrong, Juan Pablo?
- I want her to die.
Never say that.
We are a family and we have to look out for each other, always.
- You hear me?
- [phone ringing]
Hello.
[Gustavo] Cousin, Poison just took out some cops.
- Yes, go on.
How many?
- Two.
Yeah, but two what?
Sergeants or officers?
Officers.
You know Poison.
- Officers are a million each.
- OK, so two million?
- Yes, I'm writing it down here.
- OK, talk to you later.
All right.
What were you talking about?
Just business.
I want to be a businessman like you.
[sighs]
[Latin guitar theme music plays]
[Steve] Pablo's path was total war.
He established a bounty system for killing cops and over 200 were slaughtered.
The police had to build a special morgue just to hold the bodies.
The cops, they took vengeance.
[in English] My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
OK, try it again and look at me.
I've already done it 17 times.
You got me and my wife into this.
Now sit down and do it again until you get it right.
[Elisa sighs]
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
What if they ask me a question about chemistry?
- I hope you're good at bullshitting.
- OK--
Sit down.
Do it again.
It's getting better.
[Steve] We were protecting Elisa because she could tie Escobar to the Palace of Justice... but by protecting a communist, we were traitors.
Go figure.
Let's go.
- [Connie] Are you ready?
- [Elisa] Yes.
[Steve sighs]
Honey, thank you.
- You better help us get Escobar.
- I want him dead, too.
Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?
You clearly don't know your country's history in Latin America.
- Sorry, I didn't hear that--
- Honey, mellow out, OK?
Steve, I know you're mad, but this is the right thing to do.
The right thing to do?
I didn't have a choice in the matter, did I?
[Connie] This is the only choice.
[Steve sighs] You should think about going back to Miami.
They're in their car.
Hold on.
Wow.
Maybe I will.
Just get in the car, OK?
[car door slams, engine starts over radio]
OK, OK, they're on the move.
- Go.
Go, go, go.
- [engine starting]
Should've never brought Connie down here.
She's not cut out for it.
- He's got that commie bitch with him.
- [Steve] Don't do anything stupid.
Just keep your head down and this'll all be over soon enough.
We're gonna cut him off up here on the left.
[tires screeching]
Get out of the car, Murphy!
Get out!
- Step away from the vehicle.
- You following me?
- Move him away.
- [Steve] Easy.
- Easy.
- Back!
- Come on.
Move the fuck back!
- Get your hands--
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- [Lou] Hey!
- You spying on me?
- Relax, Murphy!
Who the fuck were you talking to?
The fuck is she?
Stand down.
Who were you talking to, huh?
Peña.
I got wife troubles.
- Wife troubles.
- Yeah.
[Elisa] Your husband was clever to get them to follow him.
I hope he's OK.
Shit.
[in Spanish] Good morning, ladies.
Where are you headed?
[in English] I'm sorry, sir.
I'm American.
I don't speak Spanish.
[in Spanish] You speak Spanish?
Yes.
I asked where you are headed.
- Popayán.
- Popayán?
Your papers, please.
[in English] Uh, documents.
[in Spanish] Ms. Connie Murphy.
Alba Borraga.
Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
- Be well.
Gracias, señor.
[starts engine] [indistinct chatter in Spanish]
[phone ringing]
Hello?
[sighing]
OK, yes.
OK, you got her to the orphanage.
Good.
Elisa's fine.
Oh, God.
No, I'm just glad you're OK.
Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?
I want you to call me every other hour from the road.
Actually, call me every hour.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I love you, too.
I'm proud of you.
Bye.
[Steve] Now that I knew Connie was safe, I could focus on César Gaviria.
At the time, the only thing more dangerous than being a Colombian cop was being a Colombian presidential candidate.
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]
- [metal detector beeps] - [overlapping chatter in Spanish]
Mm-hm.
[Steve] Gaviria had come out in favor of extraditing the narcos to the United States, and it was in our best interest that he win the presidency.
- But to win...
- Gracias.
...he had to survive until election day.
Uh, Señor Gaviria?
[woman in English] Through that door.
- [in English] You must be Agent Murphy.
- Hola.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
I'm Eduardo Sandoval, head of security of Dr. Gaviria.
What can we do for you?
I'm hoping that our agency can offer some resources to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.
Shouldn't the DEA be out chasing traffickers or is just my thought?
- I think the two coincide.
- Agent Murphy.
- Pleasure, sir.
- The pleasure is mine.
Please, have a seat.
Your Secret Service has briefed us on security measures.
No open-air speaking engagements, different routes home every day.
As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán, we needed an education on these things.
- Come on.
- Exactly.
These men will stop at nothing to kill you.
I'm aware of that.
And we're taking every precaution.
Your government even offers the use of an armored Cadillac limousine, built for your president.
The thing is that driving around in Bogotá with an American-made tank won't exactly endear us to the voters.
And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy, I'd say thank you.
Well, thank you.
And this?
What are we supposed to do with this?
Bullet-proof pants.
I suggest that you wear them.
Thank you, Agent Murphy, for your consideration.
And we'll keep in mind your advice.
Thank you for your time.
WITH GAVIRIA THERE WILL BE A FUTURE
[Steve] César Gaviria was riding a wave of public support for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.
But we had a target of our own:
José Rodríguez Gacha, who we tracked to Cartagena through one of our informants.
[Gacha in Spanish] Have you heard of this thing called a computer?
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.
[boy] It's a new kind of technology that's coming out.
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.
Hey, honey.
You look very beautiful today.
Relax, baby.
Relax.
We don't bite. [chuckles]
- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.
- [Gacha] Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.
I want to fuck her.
We have more important things to worry about right now, my son.
Understood?
Talk to me.
What do you know?
Don Gonzalo, we have people all over the property.
It's secure.
- We've got a few men in town as well.
- [grunts]
Now, what can you tell me about Medellín?
The same, boss.
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc is out looking for Pablo.
[Gacha] Thank you, Navegante.
- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.
Don Freddy.
Son... a question.
Are we sheep or are we wolves?
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves!
Right.
I like it.
[Navegante in Spanish] They're in a house outside of Cartagena, right here.
Just know there are a lot of people guarding him.
Navegante, you've been working for Gacha for many years.
I'm sure in that time you've earned way more than we are giving you.
So tell me, why do you want to betray him?
That fucker's crazy.
He's gonna get us all killed.
I don't believe him one bit.
What do you care why he's doing it?
Because we have 23 agents with outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.
And he has twice as many men with brand new weapons.
And frankly...
I'm tired of sending young men to face certain death.
So then we have to be smart.
We have to create a trap.
If we catch him alive, he'll give us Escobar.
And the Ochoas.
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.
I want him dead.
He doesn't care about death.
He only fears rotting in jail.
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?
These aren't your men.
You have no family here to lose.
If this goes badly, there will be more widows and orphans, and I'll have to carry that on my shoulders.
Well...
I trust his information.
And I trust you.
But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.
[in English] What do we got?
Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.
Who's this guy?
I don't know, but if Poison showed his face to pick him up, he must be really important.
[Gustavo in Spanish] Here's your payment, sir.
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain on a cargo ship.
From there, our trucks will take it to the Basque country.
It's all set up.
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain on the first flight.
[Gustavo] What's that?
As far as I know, you and my cousin have an agreement.
The agreement is for this amount.
What kind of bullshit is this?
5,000 kilos or no deal.
Then there is no deal.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Forgive my cousin, sir.
5,000 it is, then.
[Ana] We shouldn't go.
I want you in the US.
You'll be safe there, far from all of this.
- What if something happens--
- Nothing is going to happen to me.
Let's go.
Please, protect him.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Come on, I'll walk you.
- [engine starting] - [indistinct chatter in Spanish] [boy] Bye, Daddy, I love you!
[chatter in Spanish]
[Steve] Gaviria's life was on the line... my wife was with Colombia's most wanted fugitive, and my partner was in Cartagena.
He had his own mission, with a group of cops who had seen their friends and relatives die at the hands of Gacha.
Like Trujillo, whose father and two brothers, all cops, had died in gun battles with the cartel.
As hard as we were going after Gacha, the narcos wanted Gaviria.
- [up-tempo Latin music playing] - [indistinct chatter in Spanish]
It killed me to ask for help from this guy.
Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish, with none of the charm.
- [in Spanish] Hello, Suárez.
- Look who's here.
The Golden Gringo.
[in English] You don't call, you don't write.
[in Spanish] I called your office.
I only speak to Peña.
[in English] I need to know who this is.
[in Spanish] I need...
I need...
I need to know who he is.
[laughing] [mocking in Spanish] "I need to know who he is."
Don't make me laugh, faggot.
"I need to know who he is."
[in English] The fuck back!
Fuck back.
[man in Spanish] OK.
- [in Spanish] You work for me, asshole!
- [grunting]
- Right?
Clear?
Is that clear?
- [loud whimpering] [in English] You know who he is?
Gonna tell me?
Gonna speak?
Yeah...
[Steve] Suárez knew exactly who this guy was, and he wasn't the only one.
- Jesus Christ.
- Next time you wanna fuck somebody, take 'em on a date.
What's going on?
I have reason to believe the Medellín cartel is planning an imminent attack against Gaviria.
We have no intel to that effect.
Maybe you should do your job instead of spying on other agency personnel.
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing, Ambassador.
CIA's been so kind to give us these documents, but 90 percent of them are too classified for us to read.
I need to get into the White Room.
What's that?
Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.
[chuckling] You've been reading too many spy novels.
Spy novels...
Have you read The Spaniard?
[Lou] Where the hell did you get that?
Ma'am, he has been in the country for several days.
He's been escorted by one of Pablo's top sicarios.
Let me see this.
[Steve] I know the CIA has intel on this man.
Now, are you going to give me access or not?
Technically, the room isn't white.
It's more of a... burgundy.
[indistinct radio chatter]
- Agent Schroeder, will you join us?
- Mm-hm.
[Steve] The White Room was a top secret repository for the CIA's deepest, darkest secrets.
So secret, in fact, that its very existence was never acknowledged.
[lock clicks]
Sit here.
Agent Schroeder will watch you the entire time.
Where are the files?
[door buzzes]
[Latin music plays on radio]
[Gustavo in Spanish] I feel like he's still too soft.
[Pablo] He'll be fine.
I don't know, Pablo.
I feel like we need to suspend the operation.
- It's too delicate.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.
That's the reason your hair is falling out. [chuckles]
- Very funny, motherfucker.
- [laughing]
[Gustavo scoffs]
Keep laughing.
How's our boy doing, Mom?
He's learning, with a little tough love.
- What's up, Aunt?
- What's new?
That's so he can mix with the sons of the oligarchs, right?
- Yes, sir.
- So he can get us some information.
What about these clowns?
Are they treating you right?
More or less.
What do you mean "more or less"?
We treat you good.
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?
- Some rice?
- [Gustavo] Yes.
[sighs]
Thank you.
Jaime.
Welcome to the family.
Thank you,boss.
Can't you do anything?
[Gustavo] No.
While we're at war, we can't do anything.
This is bullshit.
People are turning up dead every day and my friends think my brothers are responsible.
Let's talk about something else, baby.
Yes.
All right, let's talk about running away together.
Let's get away while we can.
[chuckles softly]
"Let's get away." Listen to this.
[Marina sighs]
Why would you run away with a criminal like me?
And why not?
[scoffs]
I wish it was that easy.
- Ah.
- I can't just leave like that.
I know.
- You say that because of your wife.
- [sighs]
I don't give a shit about my wife.
I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.
[dry chuckle]
Who is the woman in that relationship?
You?
[Steve] Gacha was always paranoid when things were quiet.
And now, he began to wonder about Navegante.
[in Spanish] Hey, doll.
What are you doing?
I'm married, sir.
That's no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me.
Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.
What's up?
The Search Bloc is here, not in Medellín.
But Navegante said they were over there.
Navegante...
Navegante is a liar.
He wouldn't betray you.
Freddy... think, think.
Everyone in the world has a price.
[shouting] All right, let's go!
They want war, we'll give them war!
[men shouting eagerly in Spanish]
[sighs]
[Steve] The Spaniard was a name that got everyone's attention.
He was a member of Eta.
Never heard of 'em?
They made bomb-making a goddamn art form.
They were a group of supposed freedom fighters from the Basque country, trying to secede from Spain.
Their specialty was targeted assassinations of public figures.
- [indistinct radio chatter] - [sirens wailing]
Eta was responsible for the assassination of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco, returning home from Christmas Mass... and a remote-controlled car bomb that killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.
The man behind those bombs?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.
Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez, a celebrity now, for hire.
Expensive, but the best.
'Cause Pablo only hires the best.
That was Pablo's plan, to blow up Gaviria.
The question was, where, when and how?
[in English] I appreciate your concern, Madam Ambassador, but canceling our campaign travel is not an option.
Well, given the new information that Agent Murphy has uncovered,
I hope you'll reconsider.
He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá, and a dozen other cities.
You are a target in every one.
Yes, and... we've done everything your Secret Service and Spain's Civil Guard have recommended.
We also have bomb-sniffing dogs at every campaign stop, so...
I think we're good.
You think the Spaniard doesn't know that?
Yes, I know.
But tell me, Agent Murphy, how do you expect him to win the election if he hides like a scared rabbit behind all this violence?
Tell me, how?
How do you expect him to win if he's dead?
I'm not telling your wife you died on my watch.
This is not your watch, OK?
Thank you, Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.
I'll take my chances.
[in Spanish] His name is Steve Murphy.
He's DEA.
I hope you'll pay for this information.
[slow Latin music playing] [sighs]
Suárez is talking to the DEA.
You know what you have to do.
[in Spanish] He got away.
They killed the goddamn maid.
[man] Colonel!
Colonel...
They called from the road block.
They have a car stopped and they're saying the driver's a senator.
- Does he have his identification?
- Everything checks out.
So what's the problem?
They found a machine gun in the trunk.
Let's go.
Look at my credentials.
No, I don't know this Gacha person you're referring to.
Why do you have a gun in the trunk?
[chuckles]
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician in this country carries a weapon?
Please.
- It's my bodyguard's.
- Where's your bodyguard?
You're alone in the car, right?
Listen to me, officers... if you don't let me go immediately, you're going to regret it.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
- Give us a moment.
- Go on.
[softly] I don't believe him.
I don't either.
He could have bought his credentials.
What if it turns out he is a senator?
We'll pay for that.
I can't run that risk.
It's true.
- You can't.
- [chambers round, fires] [screams]
The next one...
goes in your head!
- All right, all right!
- Talk, bitch!
I'll talk, I'll talk!
[in Spanish] I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.
You have a guest.
It's Don Pablo.
[knocking]
Hey, Jaime.
- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?
- Your family?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome.
Tell me about them.
This is my daughter Marcela.
- Look at what a cute baby.
- [chuckles]
- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.
Of course.
Very soon, they will have the money to buy everything they want, Jaime.
Thanks a lot, boss.
- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.
Thank you.
- What about you?
- Good, sir.
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.
Guys.
All right, Jaime.
This is for you to wear during your mission.
Thank you, Ma'am.
Very kind.
Seriously, Pablo?
Thank you very much.
Everything is so beautiful.
You have to be very careful, and get by unnoticed.
For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.
All right, then, son.
Sit down.
These guys are going to give you very specific instructions.
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding the plane that is leaving for Cali.
We want you to record a conversation.
It's very simple, nothing to worry about.
All right.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm...
I'm very happy.
Thank you very much for the opportunity, Don Pablo.
Seriously.
And for the clothes.
Really, for me, it's an honor to work for you.
Thank you very much.
[softly] Don't mention it.
OK.
Come here, give me a hug.
Thank you, Don Pablo.
Thank you.
- Ma'am, have a good night.
- [woman] Take care.
Thank you very much.
See you later, boys.
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.
My love, look!
- Look at this jacket.
Beautiful, right?
- It's beautiful.
What did Pablo say?
You know what?
We're going to get ahead.
You, me and the baby are going to get ahead.
Thank you, my love.
- Look at this.
- Let's go try it on.
[in Spanish] I have some news about Gaviria.
They're going to kill him on the way to Cali.
[in English] Did you say Cali?
Hey, can I get a translate in here?
Suárez, OK.
I can translate.
[knocking at door] [in Spanish] Wait a moment.
Someone is at the door.
[stammers] "Tu puerta"?
- "Door."
- Door.
Suárez!
Suárez.
- [gunshot] - [screaming] [in Spanish] Pablo doesn't like you talking to the DEA.
[Steve over phone] Suárez!
Talk to me, you bastard.
Suárez, hello?
Hello?
Hel--
- I want that call.
- Right away, sir.
[Steve] Carrillo and his men arrived in Tolu to kill Gacha.
And Peña still hoped he could be taken alive.
[in Spanish] It was her fault, Dad.
Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.
All she had to do was say yes and I wouldn't have had to shoot her!
Be a man!
[man zips pants] [grunts] [shouts] Son of a bitch!
They found us!
- [automatic gunfire] - [overlapping shouts in Spanish]
[screams]
- Come on, son!
- [overlapping gunfire continues]
[men shouting]
[gunfire continues]
- [battle sounds muted] - [high-pitched tone] [grunts]
[sounds returning] [indistinct shouts in Spanish]
- Sir, are you OK?
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- He's trying to get away!
- He won't get away.
Get me a radio, quick!
Correal, bring a radio!
Correal!
A radio!
Dad, let's go!
Hurry, Dad, hurry!
Hurry!
[gunfire continues]
[man in Spanish] Stop!
[grunts]
Peña!
Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!
[chuckles]
What did I tell you?
We got out OK.
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?
You're a wolf, right?
Yes, I am a wolf.
[Freddy] It's a helicopter!
It's a helicopter!
They're going to kill us!
Nobody is going to kill us!
Don't talk like that!
Take this.
Take it!
- I have a Chevy in sight.
- Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
Try and disable the vehicle!
- [indistinct chatter over radio] - [man readies weapon]
[Javier] No good.
We're going in again.
Stop him!
Do whatever you have to do!
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- No, no.
Never, son, never!
Breathe!
Breathe!
Do you want this, asshole?
- Do you want this?
- [gunshots]
[Javier] We're taking fire!
We'll circle around and approach from another direction.
You don't need to worry about anything, my son.
Nothing.
[Carrillo] Don't take any chances!
We can't afford to lose him!
Copy.
Look.
Look outside.
Look outside!
[Carrillo] What's happening?
Peña, what's happening?
[Javier] We stopped him.
He's not moving.
Freddy.
Freddy?
Let's go, Freddy.
Freddy?
Freddy?
Son!
[soft whimper] [helicopter blades thumping above] [whispers] You're a wolf.
You're a wolf.
Asshole!
Asshole!
Hey, asshole!
Freddy!
Wake up, Freddy!
- Hey, asshole!
What are you gonna do?
- [gun clicks]
What are you gonna do?
Asshole!
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
[indistinct radio chatter]
[Javier] He's out of bullets.
We can take him alive.
[Carrillo] It's your call.
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
Give him lead.
[screams]
- [gunfire continues] - [shell casings clinking] [gunfire ceases]
Affirmative.
Maintain positions and patrol the area again.
Very good.
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]
Are you OK?
[in English] I'll sleep tonight.
[Steve] This was the first successful major operation by the Search Bloc.
It signaled to the country and to the world that the fight against the narcos had moved to a new level.
[in Spanish] According to recent polls, we're doing well.
We're gaining points in six districts within Cali.
That's important, because it means we could pull ahead.
- Don't put too much faith in the polls.
- I know.
The last time, we fell five points in one day.
- Yes.
We-- - [Steve] Dr. Gaviria!
Stop him!
Sir, we can't let you through!
[Eduardo] Relax.
Let him through.
- [in English] Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?
- [panting] No, no.
He can't go, no.
- What?
There's gonna be a bomb waiting.
He goes, he dies.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?
This is your job, your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.
Do you have proof?
- I got my gut.
- [scoffs]
You got your gut.
- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.
What if I'm right?
[in Spanish] You nervous?
[Jaime] A little bit, but I'm fine.
[softly] Wait here, wait here.
You know what you have to do?
Yes, sir.
Remember, you have to record the entire conversation.
Don't forget.
- No, sir.
- Have a nice flight.
Aren't you coming with me?
No, the boss just told me to bring you here.
Hey, but don't worry.
Tomorrow, I'll come and meet you there.
- All right, then.
- All right.
Don't be nervous.
You'll see how fun it is to fly.
All right?
Go on.
The line is right there.
Good luck, then.
[in Spanish] It's up to you, Eduardo.
Whatever you decide, I'll do.
[woman over PA] Avianca announces the departure of Flight 203 to Cali, now boarding at Gate 6.
[in English] I'll follow your gut this time.
[in Spanish] I'll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.
[in English] Well... it seems like you and I are not the only ones afraid.
[sighs] [in Spanish] Put on your seatbelt, please.
[seatbelt clicks]
[indistinct announcements over PA]
[indistinct conversation in Spanish]
Stop!
OK!
- How are you?
- Very well.
How are you?
Your ID, please.
Certainly.
Give me that.
How many times have I told you not to throw the ball over there?
Are you trying to scare your sister or what?
- She's crying.
- Of course she's crying.
Don't you see she's just a baby?
You yourself were a baby not too long ago.
Yes, Dad.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What's wrong, Juan Pablo?
- I want her to die.
Never say that.
We are a family and we have to look out for each other, always.
- You hear me?
Hello.
Cousin, Poison just took out some cops.
- Yes, go on.
How many?
- Two.
Yeah, but two what?
Sergeants or officers?
Officers.
You know Poison.
- Officers are a million each.
- OK, so two million?
- Yes, I'm writing it down here.
- OK, talk to you later.
All right.
What were you talking about?
Just business.
I want to be a businessman like you.
Pablo's path was total war.
He established a bounty system for killing cops and over 200 were slaughtered.
The police had to build a special morgue just to hold the bodies.
The cops, they took vengeance.
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
OK, try it again and look at me.
I've already done it 17 times.
You got me and my wife into this.
Now sit down and do it again until you get it right.
My name is Alba Borraga, born 1962 in Popayán.
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.
I graduated Universidad del Cauca with an emphasis in chemical engineering.
What if they ask me a question about chemistry?
- I hope you're good at bullshitting.
- OK--
Sit down.
Do it again.
It's getting better.
We were protecting Elisa because she could tie Escobar to the Palace of Justice... but by protecting a communist, we were traitors.
Go figure.
Let's go.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Honey, thank you.
- You better help us get Escobar.
- I want him dead, too.
Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?
You clearly don't know your country's history in Latin America.
- Sorry, I didn't hear that--
- Honey, mellow out, OK?
Steve, I know you're mad, but this is the right thing to do.
The right thing to do?
I didn't have a choice in the matter, did I?
This is the only choice.
You should think about going back to Miami.
They're in their car.
Hold on.
Wow.
Maybe I will.
Just get in the car, OK?
OK, OK, they're on the move.
- Go.
Go, go, go.
Should've never brought Connie down here.
She's not cut out for it.
- He's got that commie bitch with him.
- Don't do anything stupid.
Just keep your head down and this'll all be over soon enough.
We're gonna cut him off up here on the left.
Get out of the car, Murphy!
Get out!
- Step away from the vehicle.
- You following me?
- Move him away.
- Easy.
- Easy.
- Back!
- Come on.
Move the fuck back!
- Get your hands--
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey!
- You spying on me?
- Relax, Murphy!
Who the fuck were you talking to?
The fuck is she?
Stand down.
Who were you talking to, huh?
Peña.
I got wife troubles.
- Wife troubles.
- Yeah.
Your husband was clever to get them to follow him.
I hope he's OK.
Shit.
Good morning, ladies.
Where are you headed?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm American.
I don't speak Spanish.
You speak Spanish?
Yes.
I asked where you are headed.
- Popayán.
- Popayán?
Your papers, please.
Uh, documents.
Ms. Connie Murphy.
Alba Borraga.
Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
- Be well.
Gracias, señor.
Hello?
OK, yes.
OK, you got her to the orphanage.
Good.
Elisa's fine.
Oh, God.
No, I'm just glad you're OK.
Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?
I want you to call me every other hour from the road.
Actually, call me every hour.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I love you, too.
I'm proud of you.
Bye.
Now that I knew Connie was safe, I could focus on César Gaviria.
At the time, the only thing more dangerous than being a Colombian cop was being a Colombian presidential candidate.
Mm-hm.
Gaviria had come out in favor of extraditing the narcos to the United States, and it was in our best interest that he win the presidency.
- But to win...
- Gracias.
...he had to survive until election day.
Uh, Señor Gaviria?
Through that door.
- You must be Agent Murphy.
- Hola.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
I'm Eduardo Sandoval, head of security of Dr. Gaviria.
What can we do for you?
I'm hoping that our agency can offer some resources to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.
Shouldn't the DEA be out chasing traffickers or is just my thought?
- I think the two coincide.
- Agent Murphy.
- Pleasure, sir.
- The pleasure is mine.
Please, have a seat.
Your Secret Service has briefed us on security measures.
No open-air speaking engagements, different routes home every day.
As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán, we needed an education on these things.
- Come on.
- Exactly.
These men will stop at nothing to kill you.
I'm aware of that.
And we're taking every precaution.
Your government even offers the use of an armored Cadillac limousine, built for your president.
The thing is that driving around in Bogotá with an American-made tank won't exactly endear us to the voters.
And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy, I'd say thank you.
Well, thank you.
And this?
What are we supposed to do with this?
Bullet-proof pants.
I suggest that you wear them.
Thank you, Agent Murphy, for your consideration.
And we'll keep in mind your advice.
Thank you for your time.
WITH GAVIRIA THERE WILL BE A FUTURE
César Gaviria was riding a wave of public support for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.
But we had a target of our own:
José Rodríguez Gacha, who we tracked to Cartagena through one of our informants.
Have you heard of this thing called a computer?
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.
It's a new kind of technology that's coming out.
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.
Hey, honey.
You look very beautiful today.
Relax, baby.
Relax.
We don't bite.
- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.
- Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.
I want to fuck her.
We have more important things to worry about right now, my son.
Understood?
Talk to me.
What do you know?
Don Gonzalo, we have people all over the property.
It's secure.
- We've got a few men in town as well.
Now, what can you tell me about Medellín?
The same, boss.
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc is out looking for Pablo.
Thank you, Navegante.
- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.
Don Freddy.
Son... a question.
Are we sheep or are we wolves?
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves!
Right.
I like it.
They're in a house outside of Cartagena, right here.
Just know there are a lot of people guarding him.
Navegante, you've been working for Gacha for many years.
I'm sure in that time you've earned way more than we are giving you.
So tell me, why do you want to betray him?
That fucker's crazy.
He's gonna get us all killed.
I don't believe him one bit.
What do you care why he's doing it?
Because we have 23 agents with outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.
And he has twice as many men with brand new weapons.
And frankly...
I'm tired of sending young men to face certain death.
So then we have to be smart.
We have to create a trap.
If we catch him alive, he'll give us Escobar.
And the Ochoas.
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.
I want him dead.
He doesn't care about death.
He only fears rotting in jail.
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?
These aren't your men.
You have no family here to lose.
If this goes badly, there will be more widows and orphans, and I'll have to carry that on my shoulders.
Well...
I trust his information.
And I trust you.
But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.
What do we got?
Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.
Who's this guy?
I don't know, but if Poison showed his face to pick him up, he must be really important.
Here's your payment, sir.
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain on a cargo ship.
From there, our trucks will take it to the Basque country.
It's all set up.
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain on the first flight.
What's that?
As far as I know, you and my cousin have an agreement.
The agreement is for this amount.
What kind of bullshit is this?
5,000 kilos or no deal.
Then there is no deal.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Forgive my cousin, sir.
5,000 it is, then.
We shouldn't go.
I want you in the US.
You'll be safe there, far from all of this.
- What if something happens--
- Nothing is going to happen to me.
Let's go.
Please, protect him.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Come on, I'll walk you.
Bye, Daddy, I love you!
Gaviria's life was on the line... my wife was with Colombia's most wanted fugitive, and my partner was in Cartagena.
He had his own mission, with a group of cops who had seen their friends and relatives die at the hands of Gacha.
Like Trujillo, whose father and two brothers, all cops, had died in gun battles with the cartel.
As hard as we were going after Gacha, the narcos wanted Gaviria.
It killed me to ask for help from this guy.
Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish, with none of the charm.
- Hello, Suárez.
- Look who's here.
The Golden Gringo.
You don't call, you don't write.
I called your office.
I only speak to Peña.
I need to know who this is.
I need...
I need...
I need to know who he is.
"I need to know who he is."
Don't make me laugh, faggot.
"I need to know who he is."
The fuck back!
Fuck back.
OK.
- You work for me, asshole!
- Right?
Clear?
Is that clear?
You know who he is?
Gonna tell me?
Gonna speak?
Yeah...
Suárez knew exactly who this guy was, and he wasn't the only one.
- Jesus Christ.
- Next time you wanna fuck somebody, take 'em on a date.
What's going on?
I have reason to believe the Medellín cartel is planning an imminent attack against Gaviria.
We have no intel to that effect.
Maybe you should do your job instead of spying on other agency personnel.
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing, Ambassador.
CIA's been so kind to give us these documents, but 90 percent of them are too classified for us to read.
I need to get into the White Room.
What's that?
Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.
You've been reading too many spy novels.
Spy novels...
Have you read The Spaniard?
Where the hell did you get that?
Ma'am, he has been in the country for several days.
He's been escorted by one of Pablo's top sicarios.
Let me see this.
I know the CIA has intel on this man.
Now, are you going to give me access or not?
Technically, the room isn't white.
It's more of a... burgundy.
- Agent Schroeder, will you join us?
- Mm-hm.
The White Room was a top secret repository for the CIA's deepest, darkest secrets.
So secret, in fact, that its very existence was never acknowledged.
Sit here.
Agent Schroeder will watch you the entire time.
Where are the files?
I feel like he's still too soft.
He'll be fine.
I don't know, Pablo.
I feel like we need to suspend the operation.
- It's too delicate.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.
That's the reason your hair is falling out.
- Very funny, motherfucker.
Keep laughing.
How's our boy doing, Mom?
He's learning, with a little tough love.
- What's up, Aunt?
- What's new?
That's so he can mix with the sons of the oligarchs, right?
- Yes, sir.
- So he can get us some information.
What about these clowns?
Are they treating you right?
More or less.
What do you mean "more or less"?
We treat you good.
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?
- Some rice?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Jaime.
Welcome to the family.
Thank you,boss.
Can't you do anything?
No.
While we're at war, we can't do anything.
This is bullshit.
People are turning up dead every day and my friends think my brothers are responsible.
Let's talk about something else, baby.
Yes.
All right, let's talk about running away together.
Let's get away while we can.
"Let's get away." Listen to this.
Why would you run away with a criminal like me?
And why not?
I wish it was that easy.
- Ah.
- I can't just leave like that.
I know.
- You say that because of your wife.
I don't give a shit about my wife.
I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.
Who is the woman in that relationship?
You?
Gacha was always paranoid when things were quiet.
And now, he began to wonder about Navegante.
Hey, doll.
What are you doing?
I'm married, sir.
That's no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me.
Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.
What's up?
The Search Bloc is here, not in Medellín.
But Navegante said they were over there.
Navegante...
Navegante is a liar.
He wouldn't betray you.
Freddy... think, think.
Everyone in the world has a price.
All right, let's go!
They want war, we'll give them war!
The Spaniard was a name that got everyone's attention.
He was a member of Eta.
Never heard of 'em?
They made bomb-making a goddamn art form.
They were a group of supposed freedom fighters from the Basque country, trying to secede from Spain.
Their specialty was targeted assassinations of public figures.
Eta was responsible for the assassination of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco, returning home from Christmas Mass... and a remote-controlled car bomb that killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.
The man behind those bombs?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.
Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez, a celebrity now, for hire.
Expensive, but the best.
'Cause Pablo only hires the best.
That was Pablo's plan, to blow up Gaviria.
The question was, where, when and how?
I appreciate your concern, Madam Ambassador, but canceling our campaign travel is not an option.
Well, given the new information that Agent Murphy has uncovered,
I hope you'll reconsider.
He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá, and a dozen other cities.
You are a target in every one.
Yes, and... we've done everything your Secret Service and Spain's Civil Guard have recommended.
We also have bomb-sniffing dogs at every campaign stop, so...
I think we're good.
You think the Spaniard doesn't know that?
Yes, I know.
But tell me, Agent Murphy, how do you expect him to win the election if he hides like a scared rabbit behind all this violence?
Tell me, how?
How do you expect him to win if he's dead?
I'm not telling your wife you died on my watch.
This is not your watch, OK?
Thank you, Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.
I'll take my chances.
His name is Steve Murphy.
He's DEA.
I hope you'll pay for this information.
Suárez is talking to the DEA.
You know what you have to do.
He got away.
They killed the goddamn maid.
Colonel!
Colonel...
They called from the road block.
They have a car stopped and they're saying the driver's a senator.
- Does he have his identification?
- Everything checks out.
So what's the problem?
They found a machine gun in the trunk.
Let's go.
Look at my credentials.
No, I don't know this Gacha person you're referring to.
Why do you have a gun in the trunk?
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician in this country carries a weapon?
Please.
- It's my bodyguard's.
- Where's your bodyguard?
You're alone in the car, right?
Listen to me, officers... if you don't let me go immediately, you're going to regret it.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
- Give us a moment.
- Go on.
I don't believe him.
I don't either.
He could have bought his credentials.
What if it turns out he is a senator?
We'll pay for that.
I can't run that risk.
It's true.
- You can't.
The next one...
goes in your head!
- All right, all right!
- Talk, bitch!
I'll talk, I'll talk!
I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.
You have a guest.
It's Don Pablo.
Hey, Jaime.
- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?
- Your family?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome.
Tell me about them.
This is my daughter Marcela.
- Look at what a cute baby.
- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.
Of course.
Very soon, they will have the money to buy everything they want, Jaime.
Thanks a lot, boss.
- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.
Thank you.
- What about you?
- Good, sir.
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.
Guys.
All right, Jaime.
This is for you to wear during your mission.
Thank you, Ma'am.
Very kind.
Seriously, Pablo?
Thank you very much.
Everything is so beautiful.
You have to be very careful, and get by unnoticed.
For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.
All right, then, son.
Sit down.
These guys are going to give you very specific instructions.
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding the plane that is leaving for Cali.
We want you to record a conversation.
It's very simple, nothing to worry about.
All right.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm...
I'm very happy.
Thank you very much for the opportunity, Don Pablo.
Seriously.
And for the clothes.
Really, for me, it's an honor to work for you.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it.
OK.
Come here, give me a hug.
Thank you, Don Pablo.
Thank you.
- Ma'am, have a good night.
- Take care.
Thank you very much.
See you later, boys.
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.
My love, look!
- Look at this jacket.
Beautiful, right?
- It's beautiful.
What did Pablo say?
You know what?
We're going to get ahead.
You, me and the baby are going to get ahead.
Thank you, my love.
- Look at this.
- Let's go try it on.
I have some news about Gaviria.
They're going to kill him on the way to Cali.
Did you say Cali?
Hey, can I get a translate in here?
Suárez, OK.
I can translate.
Wait a moment.
Someone is at the door.
"Tu puerta"?
- "Door."
- Door.
Suárez!
Suárez.
Pablo doesn't like you talking to the DEA.
Suárez!
Talk to me, you bastard.
Suárez, hello?
Hello?
Hel--
- I want that call.
- Right away, sir.
Carrillo and his men arrived in Tolu to kill Gacha.
And Peña still hoped he could be taken alive.
It was her fault, Dad.
Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.
All she had to do was say yes and I wouldn't have had to shoot her!
Be a man!
Son of a bitch!
They found us!
- Come on, son!
- Sir, are you OK?
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- He's trying to get away!
- He won't get away.
Get me a radio, quick!
Correal, bring a radio!
Correal!
A radio!
Dad, let's go!
Hurry, Dad, hurry!
Hurry!
Stop!
Peña!
Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!
What did I tell you?
We got out OK.
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?
You're a wolf, right?
Yes, I am a wolf.
It's a helicopter!
It's a helicopter!
They're going to kill us!
Nobody is going to kill us!
Don't talk like that!
Take this.
Take it!
- I have a Chevy in sight.
- Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
Try and disable the vehicle!
No good.
We're going in again.
Stop him!
Do whatever you have to do!
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- No, no.
Never, son, never!
Breathe!
Breathe!
Do you want this, asshole?
- Do you want this?
We're taking fire!
We'll circle around and approach from another direction.
You don't need to worry about anything, my son.
Nothing.
Don't take any chances!
We can't afford to lose him!
Copy.
Look.
Look outside.
Look outside!
What's happening?
Peña, what's happening?
We stopped him.
He's not moving.
Freddy.
Freddy?
Let's go, Freddy.
Freddy?
Freddy?
Son!
You're a wolf.
You're a wolf.
Asshole!
Asshole!
Hey, asshole!
Freddy!
Wake up, Freddy!
- Hey, asshole!
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Asshole!
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
He's out of bullets.
We can take him alive.
It's your call.
What are you gonna do?
!
Asshole!
Give him lead.
Affirmative.
Maintain positions and patrol the area again.
Very good.
Are you OK?
I'll sleep tonight.
This was the first successful major operation by the Search Bloc.
It signaled to the country and to the world that the fight against the narcos had moved to a new level.
According to recent polls, we're doing well.
We're gaining points in six districts within Cali.
That's important, because it means we could pull ahead.
- Don't put too much faith in the polls.
- I know.
The last time, we fell five points in one day.
- Yes.
We--
- Dr. Gaviria!
Stop him!
Sir, we can't let you through!
Relax.
Let him through.
- Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?
- No, no.
He can't go, no.
- What?
There's gonna be a bomb waiting.
He goes, he dies.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?
This is your job, your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.
Do you have proof?
- I got my gut.
You got your gut.
- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.
What if I'm right?
You nervous?
A little bit, but I'm fine.
Wait here, wait here.
You know what you have to do?
Yes, sir.
Remember, you have to record the entire conversation.
Don't forget.
- No, sir.
- Have a nice flight.
Aren't you coming with me?
No, the boss just told me to bring you here.
Hey, but don't worry.
Tomorrow, I'll come and meet you there.
- All right, then.
- All right.
Don't be nervous.
You'll see how fun it is to fly.
All right?
Go on.
The line is right there.
Good luck, then.
It's up to you, Eduardo.
Whatever you decide, I'll do.
Avianca announces the departure of Flight 203 to Cali, now boarding at Gate 6.
I'll follow your gut this time.
I'll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.
Well... it seems like you and I are not the only ones afraid.
Put on your seatbelt, please.
Ragnar:
Previously on vikings...
Ragnar:
Tell me about paris.
It has these walls all around.
This city is impregnable.
Give us the name of the father of your child?
Athelstan.
(screaming loudly) athelstan.
Ragnar:
Then you're a christian again?
With all my heart.
It is better that I leave kattegat now.
What do you mean?
You cannot leave!
You're the only one I can trust so you must stay.
Floki:
Blood must be spilled.
A sacrifice be made.
My purpose is clear.
Lord, receive my soul.
There is nothing that can console me now.
Forgive me, my friend, not for what I have done.
But for what I am about to do.
(if I had a heart playing)
Boater:
Lord ragnar.
(in native tongue)
It is all very well to criticize others.
The progress of the northmen would have been frustrated
At every reach of the river.
But while others have neglected their responsibilities,
I have not been idle.
Paris has been prepared for this attack.
We are well-provisioned with food and water,
Enough to last the whole summer.
I am relieved to hear it.
To some extent,
We are at your mercy, count odo,
For you must protect us against these pagans.
Your highness, it is still not too late for you to leave the city.
Many here would urge you to save yourself.
Surely,
They would blame me for abandoning
Our capital at such a time?
Perhaps they would think it is a sensible precaution.
Allow me a moment to reflect, count odo.
Gisla:
Father?
Count odo thinks it might be a good idea for me to leave.
You must tell count odo that you have no intention of abandoning your people.
That whatever happens,
You will stay with them,
Be with them,
Protect them.
I am sure, father, that that was always your intention.
Count odo,
I am determined not to quit the city.
Not in its most urgent hour of need.
These next few days and weeks
Will test the faith of all of us.
I pray to god almighty that not one of us
Is found wanting
In either courage
Or belief.
Yours is a heavy burden,
Count odo.
You have many christian souls in your care.
I carry this burden with a light heart,
Knowing I share it with our lord, and with your highness.
But I must ask your highness if you have appealed to
Your brother, the eastern emperor, for help?
He could surely provide an army for our relief.
I will not ask either of my brothers for help.
I must prove myself better than my brothers, count odo,
And these northmen have provided the opportunity.
Defeat them,
And I will be seen as a worthy successor
To my grandfather,
To the great charlemagne.
So you see, count odo,
That your burden is...
Really much heavier than you imagined.
(man shouting war cry)
Raise shields!
(man shouting orders)
Rollo:
Climb!
Climb aboard!
Row!
Row!
King ecbert:
Mmm.
Forgive me
For asking, my son, but how is your marriage?
It's a marriage.
It is hard to forget what happened, and...
I try hard to forgive,
As our lord requires us to do.
"even those who trespass against us."
I'm glad to hear it.
There is something I wanted to ask you.
Judith is king aelle's daughter.
What does she think of her father?
And...
What would she think if we decided to overthrow him?
You would really do that?
Of course.
How else would I become bretwalda, king of kings?
King of all England.
Of course I must overthrow him.
I just wondered how upset your wife would be.
From what judith has told me, there is no love lost between them.
That is what I thought.
Do you plan to invade?
Not initially.
I have certain plans in place.
Various suggestions to invite chaos.
Including, perhaps, assassination.
My god!
Father, aelle is your ally and your friend.
Oh, no.
Not my friend.
I don't have any friends.
It's better that way.
(baby crying)
Come here, alfred.
Come to your grandfather.
A magnificent boy!
Ecbert:
I wonder how he is?
Judith:
Who?
Athelstan.
It's that name again.
Why must you forever bring him to mind?
For when I think of that filthy apostate,
It reminds me of how my wife whored with him.
-And how much more she should have suffered for it.
-Ecbert:
Aethelwulf!
This is not to do with you, father!
This is between me and this jezebel!
This harlot!
(baby crying)
Leave.
Now.
Here.
(snake hissing)
(hissing)
You wanted to talk to me, ragnar?
I miss him.
Athelstan.
I wish he was here with us.
Since you carry his cross, he still is here with us.
He would have been useful.
We will manage without him.
Well.
We have no choice now.
(grunts)
Father, forgive me.
(cries out in pain)
Holy father, forgive me.
For behold, I am a miserable sinner.
(sniffing)
Messenger:
I must speak with the prince.
Prince aethelwulf!
Prince aethelwulf!
You have interrupted the sacred.
There is no excuse.
There is one, my lord.
Death waits for no man!
You sent nobles with queen kwenthrith, to look after our interests in mercia.
What happened to you?
Repudiated the contract she signed with us.
She wants to rule alone.
(groans)
She tried to kill all of us that were sent to safeguard the interests of wessex.
She is quite mad.
Speak no more.
Rest, my lord.
I know we have had our differences of late.
Perhaps it is my fault, I have not been myself.
I want you to know, floki,
That I need you.
Now more than ever.
I've always
Believed in you.
That is why
I want you to be in command of this raid.
Me?
Sit, sit.
It's okay, sit.
King ragnar, we have reached paris.
-Now, we all want to know...
-Puh, puh, puh, puh...
The king...
My oldest friend has asked me to take command.
So...
How do we best attack the city?
(clears throat)
Have taken a closer look at the city from further up the bank.
And we suggest a plan.
To mount simultaneous attacks both from the water and from the land.
Lagertha:
I will lead an assault on the tower and the gates of the city.
We will attack the gates together.
Lagertha:
I said I would lead the assault.
I will make that decision, if and when we need to make it.
I trust earl kalf to make it.
I don't think you were listening.
At the same time as the attack at the gates,
There will also be
A river-borne attack.
The ships will be filled with warriors and means of scaling,
We will climb up and gain entry to the city that way as well.
In which case, floki, you will be responsible for constructing
Whatever it is we need to scale these walls.
(snickers) oh, don't you worry about me, rollo.
I will make something truly astonishing.
Just wait and see.
All those who agree with the plan, say aye.
All:
Aye!
Aye.
Let's hope the gods bless your efforts.
(snickers)
(aslaug speaking in native tongue)
Please take her.
Take my baby.
What are you talking about?
I cannot care for her.
Of course you can.
I can't.
I want her to be like your sons.
I want her to be viking.
What does it matter what you call someone?
Whether she's viking or not viking is not important.
What is important is that you love and nurture her.
For if you are fortunate, she will grow up healthy.
And give you grandchildren to be proud of.
Think of bjorn.
I am...
This is why I want you to raise his daughter.
Bjorn loves you.
Bjorn will be much happier
And better off without me.
That is not true.
It is a very selfish thing to believe.
(sniffling) I cannot help it.
Your daughter needs you.
She needs her mother.
You must not talk this way.
Pray to freya.
Freya will comfort you as she comforts me.
We women bear heavy burdens.
But it is not to be helped.
And even when we are dealt with harshly,
Remember, it is the gods who have woven our destinies.
Not ourselves.
My son.
I have another mission for you on our behalf.
You must go to mercia and persuade queen kwenthrith
That her interests and ours are one and the same.
She has killed six of our nobles.
Yes.
That is certainly...
Unfortunate.
And she ought to be punished.
So much for gratitude.
What kind of a world do we live in,
When the friends of our friends, kill our friends?
But still, there is a way for this deluded queen to find some redemption.
There is?
My son,
Mercia has been weakened by years of civil wars.
She is no longer what she was, and must acknowledge the power of wessex.
Without wessex, mercia is now more than ever
At the mercy of the northmen.
As well as other saxon neighbors.
Like northumbria?
Precisely.
Like northumbria.
Yes.
Those closest, but unexpected, can sow a terrible harvest.
I charge you to go to mercia.
And tell the queen that she may be forgiven for slaughtering our nobles
But only if she begs mercy and reconfirms her subjugation to wessex.
If not,
We will show her the iron fist.
We will invade and we will destroy her,
And her limbs being fastened to four horses, her body will be torn apart.
Or something of that sort.
But also tell her that we have a repugnance for such measures,
Being christians.
Torvi...
Torvi, I should have spoken before.
Why?
You know why.
It doesn't matter.
I am not with child, neither am I a child.
I took advantage.
So did I.
Uh...
This is for you.
What's that?
Nothing.
-Let me see!
-No.
You are hurting me.
It's far too good for you.
Whore.
Odo:
The northmen have been scouting the countryside, and our defenses.
We must expect an attack any day now.
I regret not sending you to safety in time.
It is much on my mind.
I did not want to be sent away.
I wanted to stay here with you.
There is nowhere I would rather be than here in paris,
Beside you, in your hour of need.
But I must tell you both,
I have been much about the city.
The people of paris are frightened to death by this pagan army.
So far, only their firm belief in god's grace and protection,
Prevents them from becoming hysterical and violent.
I am aware of the need to pacify and control the population.
Thank you, princess gisla.
Perhaps you yourself might help to reassure them
That we are well-protected, and have enough supplies to withstand a long siege.
Though, god willing, it will not come to that.
You may rely upon me to do everything possible to
Persuade the people of our ultimate victory.
Even your presence in the city, princess,
Helps them to believe in that.
Yet it is for my father to lead us to that victory.
Is it not, father?
I must to bed.
I am tired.
But I am glad we have had this conversation,
And I am also very glad that I have placed my faith in you, count odo,
As well as in god almighty,
For the successful outcome of this matter.
I must too go to bed.
Of course.
And yet I beg you to stay a moment and listen to me.
You once refused my offer of marriage.
What had I achieved?
What could I offer you?
But then I heard how many other offers of marriage you had declined,
From men far richer, far grander than me, and...
So, it gave me hope.
And my hope is that once I have successfully managed the defense of paris,
And the defeat of the northmen, and...
Gained a new and high reputation,
You will look again at my proposal?
If you save paris,
I will forever be in your debt.
But your first duty, count odo,
Is to concentrate on the defeat of the northmen.
On that, I am sure we both agree.
Floki:
Higher up.
Floki:
Pull again, pull again.
It needs to be more at an angle.
You must be hungry.
I have brought you something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
My work nourishes me.
I have so many responsibilities now, helga.
Everyone is depending on me.
My inventions will allow us to enter paris.
You will see, helga.
Our warriors will storm the walls
And we will all win the greatest renown.
Especially me.
Floki, the boat builder.
Floki, the tower maker.
But, of course...
It's not me making these towers.
It's the gods
Using my poor hands.
Do you know why they are helping me, helga?
Do you know why?
It's because I gave them a great sacrifice.
I appeased them.
I delighted them.
I filled them with joy.
Do you know what I did, helga?
Do you know what I did?
I killed athelstan!
(horses galloping)
Whoa!
Whoa.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Not until you tell me the purpose of your visit, the queen will need to know.
Queen kwenthrith knows perfectly well, that the son
Of king ecbert of wessex wishes to speak to her.
She would certainly be ill-advised if she refused to meet me.
Look!
You...
Do as you're told.
If you want to spare your life.
Judith...
You spoke before in the baths of the romans.
I was surprised.
Most of our people know nothing about them.
I still know very little, but I was always curious.
I have some words, here...
From the romans themselves.
Athelstan helped me to translate them.
Athelstan?
(reading in latin)
"don't ask, we may never know, leuconoe, what the gods plan for you and me.
"leave the chaldees to parse
"the sentence of the stars."
So strange.
As though he is here, talking to us now.
"of expectation.
Life's short.
"even while we talk, time, hateful, runs a mile.
"don't trust tomorrow's bough for fruit,
"pluck this, here, now."
Well, whoever wrote those words must be very wise.
Judith.
As long as there is breath in my body, I will protect you
And your son, alfred.
Believe me.
Hm.
(woman moaning)
(birds chirping wildly)
(athelwulf grunting angrily)
Kwenthrith:
Prince athelwulf.
Do forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Queen kwenthrith, I bring a message from my father.
He condemns the murder of our nobles, who accompanied you here in good faith.
He insists that you reaffirm the status of mercia as a client state of wessex.
Ah, so much talk of business.
Come, now.
May I offer you a cup of wine?
To our alliance.
(tuts)
There.
Now, come.
Sit.
(sighs) so...
I'm quite happy to discuss these matters further.
What is there to discuss?
My father insists that...
My father, my father!
How old are you, aethelwulf?
Do you always do what your father tells you?
Don't you have your own thoughts and your own feelings?
I have feelings of duty.
I try to do what is right.
For my country and for my god.
(laughing)
Oh.
Do you know what I wonder?
I wonder what your father threatened to do to me.
Hm...
Let's see.
Did he want to tear me apart?
Violate me?
Whip me?
Oh, whip?
Would you like to whip me?
Would it excite you?
Oh...
Come to my bed.
After all, why not enjoy what your father enjoyed?
Lead me not into temptation,
But deliver me from evil.
Goodnight.
Sweet dreams.
Come.
Prince aethelwulf?
May I present to you, my son,
Prince magnus.
Hello darling.
That is a northern name, that is not one of ours.
Oh, clever you.
Yes, he's named after his father.
His father?
I think you may know him.
Ragnar lothbrok.
Our nobles...
Before you killed them...
Never reported that you were with child,
Still less that the father was ragnar lothbrok.
Nevertheless, he is ragnar's son.
And nothing will stop him from returning to these shores
Both for magnus and for his settlement.
We have destroyed his settlement.
Then he will return
With vengeance upon you.
In which case, it will inconvenience us a great deal
If he were to find a ready ally here in mercia.
So whether or not this poor child is ragnar's son,
Makes no difference.
He cannot help you.
And you can't threaten us with him.
Guards!
(chuckling)
Queen kwenthrith,
You would be unwise to kill us.
It would give my father the very pretext he needs.
A pretext to invade mercia
And become its king.
He may even have been prepared to sacrifice me
To attain his ends.
So, if you value your life,
Then I suggest you sign the documents we have brought with us,
Reaffirming the fact that mercia is a vassal state of wessex,
And must, in future, pay not only homage, but also taxes to wessex
For the privilege.
Everything ready, floki?
Yes.
Everything is ready.
Tomorrow we attack paris.
(giggles)
(bell tolling)
(in native tongue)
(repeating with crowd as chant)
Previously on Vikings...
RAGNAR:
Tell me about Paris.
It has these walls all around.
This city is impregnable.
Give us the name of the father of your child?
Athelstan.
(SCREAMING LOUDLY) Athelstan.
ATHELSTAN:
The Lord has come to me.
RAGNAR:
Then you're a Christian again?
With all my heart.
It is better that I leave Kattegat now.
What do you mean?
You cannot leave!
You're the only one I can trust so you must stay.
FLOKI:
Blood must be spilled.
A sacrifice be made.
My purpose is clear.
Lord, receive my soul.
There is nothing that can console me now.
Forgive me, my friend, not for what I have done.
But for what I am about to do.
(IF I HAD A HEART PLAYING)
BOATER:
Lord Ragnar.
It is all very well to criticize others.
If they had agreed to act, the progress of the Northmen would have been frustrated at every reach of the river.
But while others have neglected their responsibilities, I have not been idle.
Paris has been prepared for this attack.
We are well-provisioned with food and water, enough to last the whole summer.
I am relieved to hear it.
To some extent, we are at your mercy, Count Odo, for you must protect us against these pagans.
Your Highness, it is still not too late for you to leave the city.
Many here would urge you to save yourself.
Surely, they would blame me for abandoning our capital at such a time?
Perhaps they would think it is a sensible precaution.
Allow me a moment to reflect, Count Odo.
GISLA:
Father?
Count Odo thinks it might be a good idea for me to leave.
You must tell Count Odo that you have no intention of abandoning your people.
That whatever happens, you will stay with them, be with them, protect them.
I am sure, father, that that was always your intention.
Count Odo,
I am determined not to quit the city.
Not in its most urgent hour of need.
The next few days and weeks will test the faith of all of us.
I pray to God Almighty that not one of us is found wanting in either courage
or belief.
Yours is a heavy burden,
Count Odo.
You have many Christian souls in your care.
I carry this burden with a light heart, knowing I share it with our Lord, and with your Highness.
But I must ask your Highness if you have appealed to your brother, the Eastern Emperor, for help?
He could surely provide an army for our relief.
I will not ask either of my brothers for help.
I must prove myself better than my brothers, Count Odo, and these Northmen have provided the opportunity.
Defeat them, and I will be seen as a worthy successor to my grandfather, to the great Charlemagne.
So you see, Count Odo, that your burden is... really much heavier than you imagined.
(MAN SHOUTING WAR CRY)
Raise shields!
(MAN SHOUTING ORDERS)
ROLLO:
Climb!
Climb aboard!
Row!

KING ECBERT:
Mmm.
Forgive me for asking, my son, but how is your marriage?
It's a marriage.
It is hard to forget what happened, and...
I try hard to forgive, as our Lord requires us to do.
"Even those who trespass against us."
I'm glad to hear it.
There is something I wanted to ask you.
Judith is King Aelle's daughter.
What does she think of her father?
And... what would she think if we decided to overthrow him?
- You would really do that?
- Of course.
How else would I become Bretwalda, King of Kings?
King of all England.
Of course I must overthrow him.
I just wondered how upset your wife would be.
From what Judith has told me, there is no love lost between them.
That is what I thought.
Do you plan to invade?
Not initially.
I have certain plans in place.
Various suggestions to invite chaos.
Including, perhaps, assassination.
My god!
Father,
- Aelle is your ally and your friend.
- Oh, no.
Not my friend.
I don't have any friends.
It's better that way.
(BABY CRYING)
Come here, Alfred.
Come to your grandfather.
A magnificent boy!
ECBERT:
I wonder how he is?
JUDITH:
Who?
- Athelstan.
- It's that name again.
Why must you forever bring him to mind?
For when I think of that filthy apostate, it reminds me of how my wife whored with him.
And how much more she should have suffered for it.
- ECBERT:
Aethelwulf!
- This is not to do with you, father!
This is between me and this Jezebel!
This harlot!
(BABY CRYING)
Leave.
Now.
Here.
(SNAKE HISSING)
(HISSING)
You wanted to talk to me, Ragnar?
I miss him.
Athelstan.
I wish he was here with us.
Since you carry his cross, he still is here with us.
He would have been useful.
We will manage without him.
Well.
We have no choice now.
(GRUNTS)
Father, forgive me.
(CRIES OUT IN PAIN)
Holy Father, forgive me.
For behold, I am a miserable sinner.
(SNIFFING)
MESSENGER:
I must speak with the prince.
Prince Aethelwulf!
Prince Aethelwulf!
You have interrupted the sacred.
- There is no excuse.
- There is one, my Lord.
Death waits for no man!
Who is this?
You sent nobles with Queen Kwenthrith, to look after our interests in Mercia.
What happened to you?
The Queen repudiated the contract she signed with us.
She wants to rule alone.
(GROANS)
She tried to kill all of us that were sent to safeguard the interests of Wessex.
- She is quite mad.
- Speak no more.
Rest, my Lord.
I know we have had our differences of late.
Perhaps it is my fault, I have not been myself.
I want you to know, Floki, that I need you.
Now more than ever.
I've always believed in you.
Right this way.
I want you to be in command of this raid.
Me?
Sit, sit.
It's okay, sit.
King Ragnar, we have reached Paris.
- Now, we all want to know...
- Puh, puh, puh, puh...
The king... my oldest friend has asked me to take command.
So...
How do we best attack the city?
(CLEARS THROAT)
Some of us... have taken a closer look at the city from further up the bank.
And we suggest a plan.
To mount simultaneous attacks both from the water and from the land.
LAGERTHA:
I will lead an assault on the tower and the gates of the city.
We will attack the gates together.
LAGERTHA:
I said I would lead the assault.
We may need the tools Erlendur made.
I will make that decision, if and when we need to make it.
- I trust Earl Kalf to make it.
- I don't think you were listening.
At the same time as the attack at the gates, there will also be a river-borne attack.
The ships will be filled with warriors and means of scaling, we will beach beneath the walls.
We will climb up and gain entry to the city that way as well.
In which case, Floki, you will be responsible for constructing whatever it is we need to scale these walls.
(SNICKERS)
Oh, don't you worry about me, Rollo.
I will make something truly astonishing.
Just wait and see.
All those who agree with the plan, say aye.
ALL:
Aye!
Aye.
Let's hope the gods bless your efforts.
(SNICKERS)
(ASLAUG SPEAKING IN NATIVE TONGUE)
Please take her.
Take my baby.
What are you talking about?
I cannot care for her.
Of course you can.
I can't.
I want her to be like your sons.
I want her to be Viking.
What does it matter what you call someone?
Whether she's Viking or not Viking is not important.
What is important is that you love and nurture her.
For if you are fortunate, she will grow up healthy.
And give you grandchildren to be proud of.
Think of Bjorn.
I am...
This is why I want you to raise his daughter.
Bjorn loves you.
Bjorn will be much happier and better off without me.
- That is not true.
- It is what I believe.
It is a very selfish thing to believe.
(SNIFFLING)
I cannot help it.
Your daughter needs you.
She needs her mother.
You must not talk this way.
Pray to Freya.
Freya will comfort you as she comforts me.
We women bear heavy burdens.
But it is not to be helped.
And even when we are dealt with harshly, remember, it is the gods who have woven our destinies.
Not ourselves.
My son.
I have another mission for you on our behalf.
You must go to Mercia and persuade Queen Kwenthrith that her interests and ours are one and the same.
She has killed six of our nobles.
Yes.
That is certainly... unfortunate.
And she ought to be punished.
So much for gratitude.
What kind of a world do we live in, when the friends of our friends, kill our friends?
But still, there is a way for this deluded Queen to find some redemption.
There is?
My son,
Mercia has been weakened by years of civil wars.
She is no longer what she was, and must acknowledge the power of Wessex.
Without Wessex, Mercia is now more than ever at the mercy of the Northmen.
As well as other Saxon neighbors.
Like Northumbria?
Precisely.
Like Northumbria.
Yes.
Those closest, but unexpected, can sow a terrible harvest.
I charge you to go to Mercia.
And tell the Queen that she may be forgiven for slaughtering our nobles but only if she begs mercy and reconfirms her subjugation to Wessex.
If not, we will show her the iron fist.
We will invade and we will destroy her, and her limbs being fastened to four horses, her body will be torn apart.
Or something of that sort.
But also tell her that we have a repugnance for such measures, being Christians.
Torvi...
Torvi, I should have spoken before.
Why?
You know why.
It doesn't matter.
I am not with child, neither am I a child.
I took advantage.
So did I.
Uh...
This is for you.
- What's that?
- Nothing.
- Let me see!
- No.
You are hurting me.
It's far too good for you.
Whore.

And yet I beg you to stay a moment and listen to me.
You once refused my offer of marriage.

How old are you, Aethelwulf?

Do you always do what your father tells you?
Don't you have your own thoughts and your own feelings?
I have feelings of duty.
I try to do what is right.
For my country and for my god.
(LAUGHING)

Prince Magnus.
Hello darling.
That is a Northern name, that is not one of ours.
Oh, clever you.
Yes, he's named after his father.
His father?
I think you may know him.
Ragnar Lothbrok.
Our nobles... before you killed them... never reported that you were with child, still less that the father was Ragnar Lothbrok.
Nevertheless, he is Ragnar's son.
And nothing will stop him from returning to these shores both for Magnus and for his settlement.
We have destroyed his settlement.
Then he will return with vengeance upon you.
In which case, it will inconvenience us a great deal if he were to find a ready ally here in Mercia.
So whether or not this poor child is Ragnar's son, makes no difference.
He cannot help you.
And you can't threaten us with him.

Queen Kwenthrith,
You would be unwise to kill us.

(SNIFFLING)
MAN:
I must speak with the prince.
Prince Aethelwulf!
Prince Aethelwulf!
You have interrupted the sacred.
There is no excuse.
There is one, My Lord.
Death waits for no man.
Who is this?
You sent nobles with Queen Kwenthrith, to look after our interests in Mercia.
What happened to you?
The Queen repudiated the contract she signed with us.
She wants to rule alone.
(GROANS)
She tried to kill all of us that were sent to safeguard the interests of Wessex.
She is quite mad.
Speak no more.
Rest, My Lord.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
I know we have had our differences of late.
Perhaps it is my fault, I have not been myself.
I want you to know, Floki, that I need you.
Now, more than ever.
And I've always believed in you.
That is why
I want you to be in command of this raid.
Me?
Sit, sit.
Take it.
Sit.
King Ragnar, we have reached Paris.
Now, we all want to know...
(GIBBERISH)
The king, my oldest friend, has asked me to take command.
So, uh...
How do we best attack the city?
(CLEARS THROAT)
Some of us have taken a closer look at the city from further up the bank.
And we suggest a plan.
To mount simultaneous attacks both from the water and from the land.
I will lead an assault on the tower and the gates of the city.
We will attack the gates together.
LAGERTHA:
I said I would lead the assault.
We may need the tools Erlendur made.
I will make that decision, if and when we need to make it.
I trust Earl Kalf to make it.
I don't think you were listening.
At the same time as the attack at the gates, there will also be a river borne attack.
The ships will be filled with warriors and means of scaling, we will beach beneath the walls.
We will climb up and gain entry to the city that way as well.
In which case, Floki, you will be responsible for constructing whatever it is we need to scale these walls.
(SNICKERS) Don't you worry about me, Rollo.
I will make something truly astonishing.
Just wait and see.
All those who agree with the plan, say aye.
ALL:
Aye!
Aye.
Let's hope the gods bless your efforts.
(LAUGHS)
(ASLAUG SPEAKING IN NATIVE TONGUE)
Please take her.
Take my baby.
What are you talking about?
I cannot care for her.
Of course you can.
I can't.
I want her to be like your sons.
I want her to be Viking.
What does it matter what you call someone?
Whether she's Viking or not Viking is not important.
What is important is that you love and nurture her.
For if you are fortunate, she will grow up healthy, and give you grandchildren to be proud of.
Think of Bjorn.
I am.
This is why I want you to raise his daughter.
Bjorn loves you.
Bjorn will be much happier and better off without me.
That is not true.
It is what I believe.
It is a very selfish thing to believe.
I cannot help it.
Your daughter needs you.
She needs her mother.
You must not talk this way.
Pray to Freya.
Freya will comfort you as she comforts me.
We women bear heavy burdens.
But it is not to be helped.
And even when we are dealt with harshly, remember, it is the gods who have woven our destinies.
Not ourselves.
ECBERT:
My son,
I have another mission for you on our behalf.
You must go to Mercia and persuade Queen Kwenthrith that her interests and ours are one and the same.
She has killed six of our nobles.
Yes.
That is certainly unfortunate.
And she ought to be punished.
So much for gratitude.
What kind of a world do we live in, when the friends of our friends, kill our friends?
But, still, there is a way for this deluded Queen to find some redemption.
There is?
My son,
Mercia has been weakened by years of civil wars.
She is no longer what she was, and must acknowledge the power of Wessex.
Without Wessex, Mercia is now more than ever at the mercy of the Northmen.
As well as other Saxon neighbors.
Like Northumbria?
ECBERT:
Precisely.
Like Northumbria.
Yes.
Those closest, but unexpected, can sow a terrible harvest.
ECBERT:
I charge you to go to Mercia and tell the Queen that she may be forgiven for slaughtering our nobles, but only if she begs mercy and reconfirms her subjugation to Wessex.
If not, we will show her the iron fist.
We will invade and we will destroy her, and her limbs being fastened to four horses, her body will be torn apart.
Or something of that sort.
But, also, tell her that we have a repugnance for such measures, being Christians.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
BJORN:
Torvi.
Torvi, I should have spoken before.
Why?
You know why.
It doesn't matter.
I am not with child, neither am I a child.
I took advantage.
So did I.
Uh...
This is for you.
What's that?
Nothing.
Let me see!
No.
You are hurting me.
It's far too good for you.
Whore!
(BELLS TOLLING)
ODO:
The Northmen have been scouting the countryside, and our defenses.
We must expect an attack any day now.
EMPEROR CHARLES:
Gisla, I regret not sending you to safety in time.
It is much on my mind.
I did not want to be sent away.
I wanted to stay here with you.
There is nowhere I would rather be than here in Paris, beside you, in your hour of need.
But I must tell you both,
I have been much about the city.
The people of Paris are frightened to death by this pagan army.
So far, only their firm belief in God's grace and protection, prevents them from becoming hysterical and violent.
I am aware of the need to pacify and control the population.
Thank you, Princess Gisla.
Perhaps you yourself might have to reassure them that we are well protected, and have enough supplies to withstand a long siege.
Though, God willing, it will not come to that.
You may rely upon me to do everything possible to persuade the people of our ultimate victory.
Even your presence in the city, Princess, helps them to believe in that.
Yet it is for my father to lead us to that victory.
Is it not, Father?
I must to bed.
I am tired.
But I am glad we have had this conversation.
And I am also very glad that I have placed my faith in you, Count Odo, as well as in God Almighty, for the successful outcome of this matter.
I must, too, go to bed.
Of course.
And yet, I beg you to stay a moment and listen to me.
You once refused my offer of marriage.
What did I achieve?
What could I offer you?
But then, I heard how many other offers of marriage you had declined, from men far richer, far grander than me, and...
So, it gave me hope.
And my hope is that once I have successfully managed the defense of Paris, and the defeat of the Northmen, and gained a new and high reputation, you will look again at my proposal.
If you save Paris,
I will forever be in your debt.
But your first duty, Count Odo, is to concentrate on the defeat of the Northmen.
On that, I am sure we both agree.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
FLOKI:
Higher up.
Pull again, pull again.
It needs to be more on an angle.
MAN:
Lend me a hand.
You must be hungry.
I have brought you something to eat.
FLOKI:
I'm not hungry.
My work nourishes me.
I have so many responsibilities now, Helga.
Everyone is depending on me.
My inventions will allow us to enter Paris.
You will see, Helga.
Our warriors will storm the walls and we will all win the greatest renown.
Especially me.
Floki, the boat builder.
Floki, the tower maker.
But, of course, it's not me making these towers.
It's the gods using my poor hands.
Do you know why they are helping me, Helga?
Do you know why?
It's because I gave them a great sacrifice.
I appeased them.
I delighted them.
I filled them with joy.
Do you know what I did, Helga?
Do you know what I did?
I killed Athelstan!
(HORSES GALLOPING)
Whoa!
Whoa.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Now take me to her.
Not until you tell me the purpose of your visit, the Queen will need to know.
Queen Kwenthrith knows perfectly well that the son of King Ecbert of Wessex wishes to speak to her.
She would certainly be ill-advised if she refused to meet me.
Look, you!
Do as you're told.
We might spare your life.
(URGES HORSE)
(DOOR OPENS)
ECBERT:
Judith.
You spoke before in the baths of the Romans.
I was surprised.
Most of our people know nothing about them.
I still know very little, but I was always curious.
I have some words here from the Romans themselves.
Athelstan helped me to translate them.
Athelstan?
(READING IN LATIN)
"Don't ask, we may never know, Leuconoe,
"what the gods plan for you and me.
"Leave the Chaldees to parse

So strange.

"Of expectation.
Life's short.
"Even while we talk, time, hateful, runs a mile.
"Don't trust tomorrow's bough for fruit,
"Pluck this, here, now."
Well, whoever wrote those words must be very wise.

As long as there is breath in my body, I will protect you and your son, Alfred.
Believe me.
Hmm.

KWENTHRITH:
Prince Aethelwulf.
Do forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I was bathing.
Queen Kwenthrith, I bring a message from my father.
He condemns the murder of our nobles, who accompanied you here in good faith.
He insists that you reaffirm the status of Mercia as a client state of Wessex.
(GRUNTS) So much talk of business.
Come, now.
May I offer you a cup of wine?
To our alliance.
Oh.
There.
Now, come.
Sit.
(SIGHS)
So...
I'm quite happy to discuss these matters further.
What is there to discuss?
My father insists that...
My father, my father!
How old are you, Aethelwulf?
Mmm?
Do you always do what your father tells you?
Don't you have your own thoughts and your own feelings?
I have feelings of duty.
I try to do what is right for my country and for my God.
(LAUGHING)
Oh.
Do you know what I wonder?
I wonder what your father threatened to do to me.
Hmm.
Let's see.
Did he want to tear me apart?
Violate me?
Whip me?
Oh.
Whip?
Would you like to whip me?
Would it excite you?
Oh...
Come to my bed.
After all, why not enjoy what your father enjoyed?
Princess!
Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil.
Goodnight.
Sweet dreams.
Carry on!
Everything ready, Floki?
Yes.
Everything is ready.
Tomorrow we attack Paris.
SOLDIER:
Come.
KWENTHRITH:
Prince Aethelwulf?
May I present to you, my son,
Prince Magnus.
Hello, darling.
That is a Northern name, that is not one of ours.
Oh, clever you.
Yes, he's named after his father.
His father?
I think you may know him.
Ragnar Lothbrok.
Our nobles, before you killed them, never reported that you were with child, still less that the father was Ragnar Lothbrok.
Nevertheless, he is Ragnar's son.
And nothing will stop him from returning to these shores, both for Magnus and for his settlement.
We have destroyed his settlement.
Then he will return with vengeance upon you.
In which case, it will inconvenience us a great deal if he were to find a ready ally here in Mercia.
So whether or not this poor child is Ragnar's son, makes no difference.
He cannot help you.
And you can't threaten us with him.
(LAUGHS)
Guards.
(LAUGHING)
Queen Kwenthrith, you would be unwise to kill us.
It would give my father the very pretext he needs.
A pretext to invade Mercia and become its king.
He may even have been prepared to sacrifice me to attain his ends.
So, if you value your life, and that of your son, then I suggest you sign the documents we have brought with us, reaffirming the fact that Mercia is a vassal state of Wessex and must, in future, pay not only homage, but also taxes to Wessex
for the privilege.
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

(FLOKI SPEAKING IN NATIVE TONGUE)
(CROWD CHANTING IN NATIVE TONGUE)
Previously on Vikings...
Tell me about Paris.
It has these walls all around.
This city is impregnable.
Give us the name of the father of your child?
Athelstan.
Athelstan.
The Lord has come to me.
Then you're a Christian again?
With all my heart.
It is better that I leave Kattegat now.
What do you mean?
You cannot leave!
You're the only one I can trust so you must stay.
Blood must be spilled.
A sacrifice be made.
My purpose is clear.
Lord, receive my soul.
There is nothing that can console me now.
Forgive me, my friend, not for what I have done.
But for what I am about to do.
Lord Ragnar.
It is all very well to criticize others.
If they had agreed to act, the progress of the Northmen would have been frustrated at every reach of the river.
But while others have neglected their responsibilities,
I have not been idle.
Paris has been prepared for this attack.
We are well-provisioned with food and water, enough to last the whole summer.
I am relieved to hear it.
To some extent, we are at your mercy, Count Odo, for you must protect us against these pagans.
Your Highness, it is still not too late for you to leave the city.
Many here would urge you to save yourself.
Surely, they would blame me for abandoning our capital at such a time?
Perhaps they would think it is a sensible precaution.
Allow me a moment to reflect, Count Odo.
Father?
Count Odo thinks it might be a good idea for me to leave.
You must tell Count Odo that you have no intention of abandoning your people.
That whatever happens, you will stay with them, be with them, protect them.
I am sure, father, that that was always your intention.
Count Odo,
I am determined not to quit the city.
Not in its most urgent hour of need.
These next few days and weeks will test the faith of all of us.
I pray to God Almighty that not one of us is found wanting in either courage
or belief.
Yours is a heavy burden,
Count Odo.
You have many Christian souls in your care.
I carry this burden with a light heart, knowing I share it with our Lord, and with your Highness.
But I must ask your Highness if you have appealed to your brother, the Eastern Emperor, for help?
He could surely provide an army for our relief.
I will not ask either of my brothers for help.
I must prove myself better than my brothers, Count Odo, and these Northmen have provided the opportunity.
Defeat them, and I will be seen as a worthy successor to my grandfather, to the great Charlemagne.
So you see, Count Odo, that your burden is...
Really much heavier than you imagined.
Raise shields!
Climb!
Climb aboard!
Row!
Row!
Forgive me for asking, my son, but how is your marriage?
It's a marriage.
It is hard to forget what happened, and...
I try hard to forgive, as our Lord requires us to do.
"Even those who trespass against us."
I'm glad to hear it.
There is something I wanted to ask you.
Judith is King Aelle's daughter.
What does she think of her father?
And...
What would she think if we decided to overthrow him?
You would really do that?
Of course.
How else would I become Bretwalda, King of Kings?
King of all England.
Of course I must overthrow him.
I just wondered how upset your wife would be.
From what Judith has told me, there is no love lost between them.
That is what I thought.
Do you plan to invade?
Not initially.
I have certain plans in place.
Various suggestions to invite chaos.
Including, perhaps, assassination.
My god!
Father, Aelle is your ally and your friend.
Oh, no.
Not my friend.
I don't have any friends.
It's better that way.
Come here, Alfred.
Come to your grandfather.
A magnificent boy!
I wonder how he is?
Who?
Athelstan.
It's that name again.
Why must you forever bring him to mind?
For when I think of that filthy apostate, it reminds me of how my wife whored with him.
-And how much more she should have suffered for it.
-ECBERT:
Aethelwulf!
This is not to do with you, father!
This is between me and this Jezebel!
This harlot!
Leave.
Now.
Here.
You wanted to talk to me, Ragnar?
I miss him.
Athelstan.
I wish he was here with us.
Since you carry his cross, he still is here with us.
He would have been useful.
We will manage without him.
Well.
We have no choice now.
Father, forgive me.
Holy Father, forgive me.
For behold, I am a miserable sinner.
I must speak with the prince.
Prince Aethelwulf!

It is better that I leave Kattegat now.
What do you mean?
You cannot leave!
You're the only one I can trust so you must stay.
FLOKI:
Blood must be spilled.
A sacrifice be made.
My purpose is clear.
Lord, receive my soul.
There is nothing that can console me now.
Forgive me, my friend, not for what I have done.
But for what I am about to do.
(IF I HAD A HEART PLAYING)
BOATER:
Lord Ragnar.

It is all very well to criticize others.
If they had agreed to act, the progress of the Northmen would have been frustrated at every reach of the river.
But while others have neglected their responsibilities,
I have not been idle.
Paris has been prepared for this attack.
We are well-provisioned with food and water, enough to last the whole summer.
I am relieved to hear it.
To some extent, we are at your mercy, Count Odo,
for you must protect us against these pagans.
Your Highness, it is still not too late for you to leave the city.
Many here would urge you to save yourself.
Surely, they would blame me for abandoning our capital at such a time?
Perhaps they would think it is a sensible precaution.
Allow me a moment to reflect, Count Odo.
GISLA:
Father?
Count Odo thinks it might be a good idea for me to leave.
You must tell Count Odo that you have no intention of abandoning your people.
That whatever happens, you will stay with them, be with them, protect them.
I am sure, father, that that was always your intention.
Count Odo,
I am determined not to quit the city.
Not in its most urgent hour of need.
These next few days and weeks will test the faith of all of us.
I pray to God Almighty that not one of us is found wanting in either courage
or belief.
Yours is a heavy burden,
Count Odo.
You have many Christian souls in your care.
I carry this burden with a light heart, knowing I share it with our Lord, and with your Highness.
But I must ask your Highness if you have appealed to your brother, the Eastern Emperor, for help?
He could surely provide an army for our relief.
I will not ask either of my brothers for help.
I must prove myself better than my brothers, Count Odo, and these Northmen have provided the opportunity.
Defeat them, and I will be seen as a worthy successor to my grandfather, to the great Charlemagne.
So you see, Count Odo, that your burden is... really much heavier than you imagined.
(MAN SHOUTING WAR CRY)
Raise shields!

ROLLO:
Climb!
Climb aboard!
Row!
Row!
KING ECBERT:
Mmm.
Forgive me for asking, my son, but how is your marriage?
It's a marriage.
It is hard to forget what happened, and...
I try hard to forgive, as our Lord requires us to do.
"Even those who trespass against us."
I'm glad to hear it.
There is something I wanted to ask you.
Judith is King Aelle's daughter.
What does she think of her father?
And...
What would she think if we decided to overthrow him?
You would really do that?
Of course.
How else would I become Bretwalda, King of Kings?
King of all England.
Of course I must overthrow him.
I just wondered how upset your wife would be.
From what Judith has told me, there is no love lost between them.
That is what I thought.
Do you plan to invade?
Not initially.
I have certain plans in place.
Various suggestions to invite chaos.
Including, perhaps, assassination.
My god!
Father, Aelle is your ally and your friend.
Oh, no.
Not my friend.
I don't have any friends.
It's better that way.
(BABY CRYING)
Come here, Alfred.
Come to your grandfather.
A magnificent boy!
ECBERT:
I wonder how he is?
JUDITH:
Who?
Athelstan.
It's that name again.
Why must you forever bring him to mind?
For when I think of that filthy apostate, it reminds me of how my wife whored with him.
And how much more she should have suffered for it.
- ECBERT:
Aethelwulf!
- This is not to do with you, father!
This is between me and this Jezebel!
This harlot!
(BABY CRYING)
Leave.
Now.
Here.
(SNAKE HISSING)
(HISSING)
You wanted to talk to me, Ragnar?
I miss him.
Athelstan.
I wish he was here with us.
Since you carry his cross, he still is here with us.
He would have been useful.
We will manage without him.
Well.
We have no choice now.
(GRUNTS)
Father, forgive me.
(CRIES OUT IN PAIN)
Holy Father, forgive me.
For behold, I am a miserable sinner.
(SNIFFING)
MESSENGER:
I must speak with the prince.
Prince Aethelwulf!
Prince Aethelwulf!
You have interrupted the sacred.
There is no excuse.
There is one, my Lord.
Death waits for no man!
Who is this?
You sent nobles with Queen Kwenthrith, to look after our interests in Mercia.
What happened to you?
The Queen repudiated the contract she signed with us.
She wants to rule alone.
(GROANS)
She tried to kill all of us that were sent to safeguard the interests of Wessex.
She is quite mad.
Speak no more.
Rest, my Lord.
I know we have had our differences of late.
Perhaps it is my fault, I have not been myself.
I want you to know, Floki, that I need you.
Now more than ever.
I've always believed in you.
Right this way.
I want you to be in command of this raid.
Me?
Sit, sit.
It's okay, sit.
King Ragnar, we have reached Paris.
Now...
- Now, we all want to know...
- Puh, puh, puh, puh...
The king... my oldest friend has asked me to take command.
So...
How do we best attack the city?
(CLEARS THROAT)
Some of us... have taken a closer look at the city from further up the bank.
And we suggest a plan.
To mount simultaneous attacks both from the water and from the land.
LAGERTHA:
I will lead an assault on the tower and the gates of the city.
We will attack the gates together.
LAGERTHA:
I said I would lead the assault.
We may need the tools Erlendur made.
I will make that decision, if and when we need to make it.
I trust Earl Kalf to make it.
I don't think you were listening.
At the same time as the attack at the gates, there will also be a river-borne attack.
The ships will be filled with warriors and means of scaling, we will beach beneath the walls.
We will climb up and gain entry to the city that way as well.
In which case, Floki, you will be responsible for constructing whatever it is we need to scale these walls.
(SNICKERS) Oh, don't you worry about me, Rollo.
I will make something truly astonishing.
Just wait and see.
All those who agree with the plan, say aye.
ALL:
Aye!
Aye.
Let's hope the gods bless your efforts.
(SNICKERS)
(ASLAUG SPEAKING IN NATIVE TONGUE)
Please take her.
Take my baby.
What are you talking about?
I cannot care for her.
Of course you can.
I can't.
I want her to be like your sons.
I want her to be Viking.
What does it matter what you call someone?
Whether she's Viking or not Viking is not important.
What is important is that you love and nurture her.
For if you are fortunate, she will grow up healthy.
And give you grandchildren to be proud of.
Think of Bjorn.
I am...
This is why I want you to raise his daughter.
Bjorn loves you.
Bjorn will be much happier and better off without me.
That is not true.
It is what I believe.
It is a very selfish thing to believe.
(SNIFFLING) I cannot help it.
Your daughter needs you.
She needs her mother.
You must not talk this way.
Pray to Freya.
Freya will comfort you as she comforts me.
We women bear heavy burdens.
But it is not to be helped.
And even when we are dealt with harshly, remember, it is the gods who have woven our destinies.
Not ourselves.
My son.
I have another mission for you on our behalf.
You must go to Mercia and persuade Queen Kwenthrith that her interests and ours are one and the same.
She has killed six of our nobles.
Yes.
That is certainly... unfortunate.
And she ought to be punished.
So much for gratitude.
What kind of a world do we live in, when the friends of our friends, kill our friends?
But still, there is a way for this deluded Queen to find some redemption.
There is?
My son,
Mercia has been weakened by years of civil wars.
She is no longer what she was, and must acknowledge the power of Wessex.
Without Wessex, Mercia is now more than ever at the mercy of the Northmen.
As well as other Saxon neighbors.
Like Northumbria?
Precisely.
Like Northumbria.
Yes.
Those closest, but unexpected, can sow a terrible harvest.
I charge you to go to Mercia.
And tell the Queen that she may be forgiven for slaughtering our nobles but only if she begs mercy and reconfirms her subjugation to Wessex.
If not, we will show her the iron fist.
We will invade and we will destroy her, and her limbs being fastened to four horses, her body will be torn apart.
Or something of that sort.
But also tell her that we have a repugnance for such measures, being Christians.
Torvi...
Torvi, I should have spoken before.
Why?
You know why.
It doesn't matter.
I am not with child, neither am I a child.
I took advantage.
So did I.
Uh...
This is for you.
What's that?
Nothing.
- Let me see!
- No.
You are hurting me.
It's far too good for you.
Whore.
ODO:
The Northmen have been scouting the countryside, and our defenses.
We must expect an attack any day now.
EMPORER CHARLES:
Gisla,
I regret not sending you to safety in time.
It is much on my mind.
I did not want to be sent away.
I wanted to stay here with you.
There is nowhere I would rather be than here in Paris, beside you, in your hour of need.
But I must tell you both,
I have been much about the city.
The people of Paris are frightened to death by this pagan army.
So far, only their firm belief in god's grace and protection, prevents them from becoming hysterical and violent.
I am aware of the need to pacify and control the population.
Thank you, Princess Gisla.
Perhaps you yourself might help to reassure them that we are well-protected, and have enough supplies to withstand a long siege.
Though, god willing, it will not come to that.
You may rely upon me to do everything possible to persuade the people of our ultimate victory.
Even your presence in the city, Princess, helps them to believe in that.
Yet it is for my father to lead us to that victory.
Is it not, father?
I must to bed.
I am tired.
But I am glad we have had this conversation, and I am also very glad that I have placed my faith in you, Count Odo,
as well as in God Almighty, for the successful outcome of this matter.
I must too go to bed.
Of course.
And yet I beg you to stay a moment and listen to me.
You once refused my offer of marriage.
What had I achieved?
What could I offer you?
But then I heard how many other offers of marriage you had declined, from men far richer, far grander than me, and...
So, it gave me hope.
And my hope is that once I have successfully managed the defense of Paris, and the defeat of the Northmen, and... gained a new and high reputation, you will look again at my proposal?
If you save Paris,
I will forever be in your debt.
But your first duty, Count Odo, is to concentrate on the defeat of the Northmen.
On that, I am sure we both agree.
FLOKI:
Higher up.
FLOKI:
Pull again, pull again.
It needs to be more at an angle.
You must be hungry.
I have brought you something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
My work nourishes me.
I have so many responsibilities now, Helga.
Everyone is depending on me.
My inventions will allow us to enter Paris.
You will see, Helga.
Our warriors will storm the walls and we will all win the greatest renown.
Especially me.
Floki, the boat builder.
Floki, the tower maker.
But, of course... it's not me making these towers.
It's the gods using my poor hands.
Do you know why they are helping me, Helga?
Do you know why?
It's because I gave them a great sacrifice.
I appeased them.
I delighted them.
I filled them with joy.
Do you know what I did, Helga?
Do you know what I did?
I killed Athelstan!
(HORSES GALLOPING)
Whoa!
Whoa.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Now take me to her.
Not until you tell me the purpose of your visit, the Queen will need to know.
Queen Kwenthrith knows perfectly well, that the son of King Ecbert of Wessex wishes to speak to her.
She would certainly be ill-advised if she refused to meet me.
Look!
You...
Do as you're told.
If you want to spare your life.
Judith...
You spoke before in the baths of the Romans.
I was surprised.
Most of our people know nothing about them.
I still know very little, but I was always curious.
I have some words, here... from the Romans themselves.
Athelstan helped me to translate them.
Athelstan?
(READING IN LATIN)
"Don't ask, we may never know, Leuconoe, what the gods plan for you and me.
Leave the Chaldees to parse the sentence of the stars."
So strange.
As though he is here, talking to us now.
"Of expectation.
Life's short.
Even while we talk, time, hateful, runs a mile.
Don't trust tomorrow's bough for fruit,
Pluck this, here, now."
Well, whoever wrote those words must be very wise.
Judith.
As long as there is breath in my body, I will protect you and your son, Alfred.
Believe me.
Hm.
(WOMAN MOANING)
(BIRDS CHIRPING WILDLY)
(ATHELWULF GRUNTING ANGRILY)
KWENTHRITH:
Prince Athelwulf.
Do forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I was bathing.
Queen Kwenthrith, I bring a message from my father.
He condemns the murder of our nobles, who accompanied you here in good faith.
He insists that you reaffirm the status of Mercia as a client state of Wessex.
Ah, so much talk of business.
Come, now.
May I offer you a cup of wine?
To our alliance.
(TUTS)
There.
Now, come.
Sit.
(SIGHS) So...
I'm quite happy to discuss these matters further.
What is there to discuss?
My father insists that...
My father, my father!
How old are you, Aethelwulf?
Hm?
Do you always do what your father tells you?
Don't you have your own thoughts and your own feelings?
I have feelings of duty.
I try to do what is right.
For my country and for my god.
(LAUGHING)
Oh.
Do you know what I wonder?
I wonder what your father threatened to do to me.
Hm...
Let's see.
Did he want to tear me apart?
Violate me?
Whip me?
Oh, whip?
Would you like to whip me?
Would it excite you?
Oh...
Come to my bed.
After all, why not enjoy what your father enjoyed?
Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil.
Goodnight.
Sweet dreams.
Come.
Prince Aethelwulf?
May I present to you, my son,
Prince Magnus.
Hello darling.
That is a Northern name, that is not one of ours.
Oh, clever you.
Yes, he's named after his father.
His father?
I think you may know him.
Ragnar Lothbrok.
Our nobles... before you killed them... never reported that you were with child, still less that the father was Ragnar Lothbrok.
Nevertheless, he is Ragnar's son.
And nothing will stop him from returning to these shores both for Magnus and for his settlement.
We have destroyed his settlement.
Then he will return with vengeance upon you.
In which case, it will inconvenience us a great deal if he were to find a ready ally here in Mercia.
So whether or not this poor child is Ragnar's son, makes no difference.
He cannot help you.
And you can't threaten us with him.
Guards!
(CHUCKLING)
Queen Kwenthrith,
You would be unwise to kill us.
It would give my father the very pretext he needs.
A pretext to invade Mercia and become its king.
He may even have been prepared to sacrifice me to attain his ends.
So, if you value your life, and that of your son, then I suggest you sign the documents we have brought with us, reaffirming the fact that Mercia is a vassal state of Wessex, and must, in future, pay not only homage, but also taxes to Wessex
for the privilege.
Everything ready, Floki?
Yes.
Everything is ready.
Tomorrow we attack Paris.

Previously on Vikings...
Tell me about Paris.
It has these walls all around.
This city is impregnable.
Give us the name of the father of your child?
Athelstan.
Athelstan.
The Lord has come to me.
Then you're a Christian again?
With all my heart.
It is better that I leave Kattegat now.
What do you mean?
You cannot leave!
You're the only one I can trust so you must stay.
Blood must be spilled.
A sacrifice be made.
My purpose is clear.

Raise shields!
Climb!

Mmm.
Forgive me for asking, my son, but how is your marriage?
It's a marriage.
It is hard to forget what happened, and...
I try hard to forgive, as our Lord requires us to do.
"Even those who trespass against us."
I'm glad to hear it.
There is something I wanted to ask you.
Judith is King Aelle's daughter.
What does she think of her father?
And... what would she think if we decided to overthrow him?
- You would really do that?
- Of course.
How else would I become Bretwalda, King of Kings?
King of all England.
Of course I must overthrow him.
I just wondered how upset your wife would be.
From what Judith has told me, there is no love lost between them.
That is what I thought.
Do you plan to invade?
Not initially.
I have certain plans in place.
Various suggestions to invite chaos.
Including, perhaps, assassination.
My god!
Father,
- Aelle is your ally and your friend.
- Oh, no.
Not my friend.
I don't have any friends.
It's better that way.
Come here, Alfred.

Queen Kwenthrith knows perfectly well, that the son of King Ecbert of Wessex wishes to speak to her.
She would certainly be ill-advised if she refused to meet me.
Look!
You...
Do as you're told.
If you want to spare your life.
Judith...
You spoke before in the baths of the Romans.
I was surprised.
Most of our people know nothing about them.
I still know very little, but I was always curious.
I have some words, here... from the Romans themselves.
Athelstan helped me to translate them.
Athelstan?
"Don't ask, we may never know, Leuconoe, what the gods plan for you and me.
Leave the Chaldees to parse the sentence of the stars."
So strange.
As though he is here, talking to us now.
"Of expectation.
Life's short.
"Even while we talk, time, hateful, runs a mile.
"Don't trust tomorrow's bough for fruit,
Pluck this, here, now."
Well, whoever wrote those words must be very wise.
Judith.
As long as there is breath in my body,
I will protect you and your son, Alfred.
Believe me.
Hm.
Prince Athelwulf.
Do forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I was bathing.
Queen Kwenthrith,
I bring a message from my father.
He condemns the murder of our nobles, who accompanied you here in good faith.
He insists that you reaffirm the status of Mercia as a client state of Wessex.
Ah, so much talk of business.
Come, now.
May I offer you a cup of wine?
To our alliance.
There.
Now, come.
Sit.
So...
I'm quite happy to discuss these matters further.
What is there to discuss?
- My father insists that...
- My father, my father!
How old are you, Aethelwulf?
Hm?
Do you always do what your father tells you?
Don't you have your own thoughts and your own feelings?
I have feelings of duty.
I try to do what is right.
For my country and for my god.
Oh.
Do you know what I wonder?
I wonder what your father threatened to do to me.
Hm...
Let's see.
Did he want to tear me apart?
Violate me?
Whip me?
Oh, whip?
Would you like to whip me?
Would it excite you?
Oh...
Come to my bed.
After all, why not enjoy what your father enjoyed?
Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil.
Goodnight.
Sweet dreams.
Come.
Prince Aethelwulf?
May I present to you, my son,
Prince Magnus.
Hello darling.
That is a Northern name, that is not one of ours.
Oh, clever you.
Yes, he's named after his father.
His father?
I think you may know him.
Ragnar Lothbrok.
Our nobles... before you killed them... never reported that you were with child, still less that the father was Ragnar Lothbrok.
Nevertheless, he is Ragnar's son.
And nothing will stop him from returning to these shores both for Magnus and for his settlement.
We have destroyed his settlement.
Then he will return with vengeance upon you.
In which case, it will inconvenience us a great deal if he were to find a ready ally here in Mercia.
So whether or not this poor child is Ragnar's son, makes no difference.
He cannot help you.
And you can't threaten us with him.
Guards!
Queen Kwenthrith,
You would be unwise to kill us.
It would give my father the very pretext he needs.
A pretext to invade Mercia and become its king.
He may even have been prepared to sacrifice me to attain his ends.
So, if you value your life, and that of your son, then I suggest you sign the documents we have brought with us, reaffirming the fact that Mercia is a vassal state of Wessex, and must, in future, pay not only homage,
but also taxes to Wessex for the privilege.
Everything ready, Floki?
Yes.
Everything is ready.
Tomorrow we attack Paris.
Previously on Vikings...
Tell me about Paris.
It has these walls all around.
This city is impregnable.
Give us the name of the father of your child?
Athelstan.
Athelstan.
The Lord has come to me.
Then you're a Christian again?
With all my heart.
It is better that I leave Kattegat now.
What do you mean?
You cannot leave!
You're the only one I can trust so you must stay.
Blood must be spilled.
A sacrifice be made.
My purpose is clear.
Lord, receive my soul.
There is nothing that can console me now.
Forgive me, my friend, not for what I have done.
But for what I am about to do.
Lord Ragnar.

It is all very well to criticize others.
If they had agreed to act, the progress of the Northmen would have been frustrated at every reach of the river.
But while others have neglected their responsibilities,
I have not been idle.
Paris has been prepared for this attack.
We are well-provisioned with food and water, enough to last the whole summer.
I am relieved to hear it.
To some extent, we are at your mercy, Count Odo,
for you must protect us against these pagans.
Your Highness, it is still not too late for you to leave the city.
Many here would urge you to save yourself.
Surely, they would blame me for abandoning our capital at such a time?
Perhaps they would think it is a sensible precaution.
Allow me a moment to reflect, Count Odo.
Father?
Count Odo thinks it might be a good idea for me to leave.
You must tell Count Odo that you have no intention of abandoning your people.
That whatever happens, you will stay with them, be with them, protect them.
I am sure, father, that that was always your intention.
Count Odo,
I am determined not to quit the city.
Not in its most urgent hour of need.
These next few days and weeks will test the faith of all of us.
I pray to God Almighty that not one of us is found wanting in either courage
or belief.
Yours is a heavy burden,
Count Odo.
You have many Christian souls in your care.
I carry this burden with a light heart, knowing I share it with our Lord, and with your Highness.
But I must ask your Highness if you have appealed to your brother, the Eastern Emperor, for help?
He could surely provide an army for our relief.
I will not ask either of my brothers for help.
I must prove myself better than my brothers, Count Odo, and these Northmen have provided the opportunity.
Defeat them, and I will be seen as a worthy successor to my grandfather, to the great Charlemagne.
So you see, Count Odo, that your burden is... really much heavier than you imagined.
Raise shields!
Climb!
Climb aboard!
Row!
Row!
Mmm.
Forgive me for asking, my son, but how is your marriage?
It's a marriage.
It is hard to forget what happened, and...
I try hard to forgive, as our Lord requires us to do.
"Even those who trespass against us."
I'm glad to hear it.
There is something I wanted to ask you.
Judith is King Aelle's daughter.
What does she think of her father?
And...
What would she think if we decided to overthrow him?
You would really do that?
Of course.
How else would I become Bretwalda, King of Kings?
King of all England.
Of course I must overthrow him.
I just wondered how upset your wife would be.
From what Judith has told me, there is no love lost between them.
That is what I thought.
Do you plan to invade?
Not initially.
I have certain plans in place.
Various suggestions to invite chaos.
Including, perhaps, assassination.
My god!
Father, Aelle is your ally and your friend.
Oh, no.
Not my friend.
I don't have any friends.
It's better that way.
Come here, Alfred.
Come to your grandfather.
A magnificent boy!
I wonder how he is?
Who?
Athelstan.
It's that name again.
Why must you forever bring him to mind?
For when I think of that filthy apostate, it reminds me of how my wife whored with him.
And how much more she should have suffered for it.
- Aethelwulf!
- This is not to do with you, father!
This is between me and this Jezebel!
This harlot!
Leave.
Now.
Here.
You wanted to talk to me, Ragnar?
I miss him.
Athelstan.
I wish he was here with us.
Since you carry his cross, he still is here with us.
He would have been useful.
We will manage without him.
Well.
We have no choice now.
Father, forgive me.
Holy Father, forgive me.
For behold, I am a miserable sinner.
I must speak with the prince.
Prince Aethelwulf!
Prince Aethelwulf!
You have interrupted the sacred.
There is no excuse.
There is one, my Lord.
Death waits for no man!
Who is this?
You sent nobles with Queen Kwenthrith, to look after our interests in Mercia.
What happened to you?
The Queen repudiated the contract she signed with us.
She wants to rule alone.
She tried to kill all of us that were sent to safeguard the interests of Wessex.
She is quite mad.
Speak no more.
Rest, my Lord.
I know we have had our differences of late.
Perhaps it is my fault, I have not been myself.
I want you to know, Floki, that I need you.
Now more than ever.
I've always believed in you.
Right this way.
I want you to be in command of this raid.
Me?
Sit, sit.
It's okay, sit.
King Ragnar, we have reached Paris.
Now...
- Now, we all want to know...
- Puh, puh, puh, puh...
The king... my oldest friend has asked me to take command.
So...
How do we best attack the city?
Some of us... have taken a closer look at the city from further up the bank.
And we suggest a plan.
To mount simultaneous attacks both from the water and from the land.
I will lead an assault on the tower and the gates of the city.
We will attack the gates together.
I said I would lead the assault.
We may need the tools Erlendur made.
I will make that decision, if and when we need to make it.
I trust Earl Kalf to make it.
I don't think you were listening.
At the same time as the attack at the gates, there will also be a river-borne attack.
The ships will be filled with warriors and means of scaling, we will beach beneath the walls.
We will climb up and gain entry to the city that way as well.
In which case, Floki, you will be responsible for constructing whatever it is we need to scale these walls.
Oh, don't you worry about me, Rollo.
I will make something truly astonishing.
Just wait and see.
All those who agree with the plan, say aye.
Aye!
Aye.
Let's hope the gods bless your efforts.
Please take her.
Take my baby.
What are you talking about?
I cannot care for her.
Of course you can.
I can't.
I want her to be like your sons.
I want her to be Viking.
What does it matter what you call someone?
Whether she's Viking or not Viking is not important.
What is important is that you love and nurture her.
For if you are fortunate, she will grow up healthy.
And give you grandchildren to be proud of.
Think of Bjorn.
I am...
This is why I want you to raise his daughter.
Bjorn loves you.
Bjorn will be much happier and better off without me.
That is not true.
It is what I believe.
It is a very selfish thing to believe.
I cannot help it.
Your daughter needs you.
She needs her mother.
You must not talk this way.
Pray to Freya.
Freya will comfort you as she comforts me.
We women bear heavy burdens.
But it is not to be helped.
And even when we are dealt with harshly, remember, it is the gods who have woven our destinies.
Not ourselves.
My son.
I have another mission for you on our behalf.
You must go to Mercia and persuade Queen Kwenthrith that her interests and ours are one and the same.
She has killed six of our nobles.
Yes.
That is certainly... unfortunate.
And she ought to be punished.
So much for gratitude.
What kind of a world do we live in, when the friends of our friends, kill our friends?
But still, there is a way for this deluded Queen to find some redemption.
There is?
My son,
Mercia has been weakened by years of civil wars.
She is no longer what she was, and must acknowledge the power of Wessex.
Without Wessex, Mercia is now more than ever at the mercy of the Northmen.
As well as other Saxon neighbors.
Like Northumbria?
Precisely.
Like Northumbria.
Yes.
Those closest, but unexpected, can sow a terrible harvest.
I charge you to go to Mercia.
And tell the Queen that she may be forgiven for slaughtering our nobles but only if she begs mercy and reconfirms her subjugation to Wessex.
If not, we will show her the iron fist.
We will invade and we will destroy her, and her limbs being fastened to four horses, her body will be torn apart.
Or something of that sort.
But also tell her that we have a repugnance for such measures, being Christians.
Torvi...
Torvi, I should have spoken before.
Why?
You know why.
It doesn't matter.
I am not with child, neither am I a child.
I took advantage.
So did I.
Uh...
This is for you.
What's that?
Nothing.
- Let me see!
- No.
You are hurting me.
It's far too good for you.
Whore.
The Northmen have been scouting the countryside, and our defenses.
We must expect an attack any day now.
Gisla,
I regret not sending you to safety in time.
It is much on my mind.
I did not want to be sent away.
I wanted to stay here with you.
There is nowhere I would rather be than here in Paris, beside you, in your hour of need.
But I must tell you both,
I have been much about the city.
The people of Paris are frightened to death by this pagan army.
So far, only their firm belief in god's grace and protection, prevents them from becoming hysterical and violent.
I am aware of the need to pacify and control the population.
Thank you, Princess Gisla.
Perhaps you yourself might help to reassure them that we are well-protected, and have enough supplies to withstand a long siege.
Though, god willing, it will not come to that.
You may rely upon me to do everything possible to persuade the people of our ultimate victory.
Even your presence in the city, Princess, helps them to believe in that.
Yet it is for my father to lead us to that victory.
Is it not, father?
I must to bed.
I am tired.
But I am glad we have had this conversation, and I am also very glad that I have placed my faith in you, Count Odo,
as well as in God Almighty, for the successful outcome of this matter.
I must too go to bed.
Of course.
And yet I beg you to stay a moment and listen to me.
You once refused my offer of marriage.
What had I achieved?
What could I offer you?
But then I heard how many other offers of marriage you had declined, from men far richer, far grander than me, and...
So, it gave me hope.
And my hope is that once I have successfully managed the defense of Paris, and the defeat of the Northmen, and... gained a new and high reputation, you will look again at my proposal?
If you save Paris,
I will forever be in your debt.
But your first duty, Count Odo, is to concentrate on the defeat of the Northmen.
On that, I am sure we both agree.
Higher up.
Pull again, pull again.
It needs to be more at an angle.
You must be hungry.
I have brought you something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
My work nourishes me.
I have so many responsibilities now, Helga.
Everyone is depending on me.
My inventions will allow us to enter Paris.
You will see, Helga.
Our warriors will storm the walls and we will all win the greatest renown.
Especially me.
Floki, the boat builder.
Floki, the tower maker.
But, of course... it's not me making these towers.
It's the gods using my poor hands.
Do you know why they are helping me, Helga?
Do you know why?
It's because I gave them a great sacrifice.
I appeased them.
I delighted them.
I filled them with joy.
Do you know what I did, Helga?
Do you know what I did?
I killed Athelstan!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Now take me to her.
Not until you tell me the purpose of your visit, the Queen will need to know.
Queen Kwenthrith knows perfectly well, that the son of King Ecbert of Wessex wishes to speak to her.
She would certainly be ill-advised if she refused to meet me.
Look!
You...

Judith.
As long as there is breath in my body, I will protect you and your son, Alfred.
Believe me.
Hm.

Do forgive me for keeping you waiting.

Do you always do what your father tells you?
Don't you have your own thoughts and your own feelings?
I have feelings of duty.
I try to do what is right.
For my country and for my god.
Oh.
Do you know what I wonder?
I wonder what your father threatened to do to me.
Hm...
Let's see.
Did he want to tear me apart?

Hello darling.
That is a Northern name, that is not one of ours.

Ragnar Lothbrok.

So whether or not this poor child is Ragnar's son, makes no difference.

And you can't threaten us with him.

Queen Kwenthrith,
You would be unwise to kill us.
It would give my father the very pretext he needs.
A pretext to invade Mercia and become its king.
He may even have been prepared to sacrifice me to attain his ends.
So, if you value your life, and that of your son, then I suggest you sign the documents we have brought with us, reaffirming the fact that Mercia is a vassal state of Wessex, and must, in future, pay not only homage, but also taxes to Wessex
for the privilege.

I am not with child, neither am I a child.
I took advantage.
So did I.
Uh...
This is for you.
What's that?
Nothing.
Let me see!
No.
You are hurting me.
It's far too good for you.
Whore!
(BELLS TOLLING)
ODO:
The Northmen have been scouting the countryside, and our defenses.
We must expect an attack any day now.
EMPEROR CHARLES:
Gisla, I regret not sending you to safety in time.
It is much on my mind.
I did not want to be sent away.
I wanted to stay here with you.
There is nowhere I would rather be than here in Paris, beside you, in your hour of need.
But I must tell you both,
I have been much about the city.
The people of Paris are frightened to death by this pagan army.
So far, only their firm belief in God's grace and protection, prevents them from becoming hysterical and violent.
I am aware of the need to pacify and control the population.
Thank you, Princess Gisla.
Perhaps you yourself might have to reassure them that we are well protected, and have enough supplies to withstand a long siege.
Though, God willing, it will not come to that.
You may rely upon me to do everything possible to persuade the people of our ultimate victory.
Even your presence in the city, Princess, helps them to believe in that.
Yet it is for my father to lead us to that victory.
Is it not, Father?
I must to bed.
I am tired.
But I am glad we have had this conversation.
And I am also very glad that I have placed my faith in you, Count Odo, as well as in God Almighty, for the successful outcome of this matter.
I must, too, go to bed.
Of course.
And yet, I beg you to stay a moment and listen to me.
You once refused my offer of marriage.
What did I achieve?
What could I offer you?
But then, I heard how many other offers of marriage you had declined, from men far richer, far grander than me, and...
So, it gave me hope.
And my hope is that once I have successfully managed the defense of Paris, and the defeat of the Northmen, and gained a new and high reputation, you will look again at my proposal.
If you save Paris,
I will forever be in your debt.
But your first duty, Count Odo, is to concentrate on the defeat of the Northmen.
On that, I am sure we both agree.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
FLOKI:
Higher up.
Pull again, pull again.
It needs to be more on an angle.
MAN:
Lend me a hand.
You must be hungry.
I have brought you something to eat.
FLOKI:
I'm not hungry.
My work nourishes me.
I have so many responsibilities now, Helga.
Everyone is depending on me.
My inventions will allow us to enter Paris.
You will see, Helga.
Our warriors will storm the walls and we will all win the greatest renown.
Especially me.
Floki, the boat builder.
Floki, the tower maker.
But, of course, it's not me making these towers.
It's the gods using my poor hands.
Do you know why they are helping me, Helga?
Do you know why?
It's because I gave them a great sacrifice.
I appeased them.
I delighted them.
I filled them with joy.
Do you know what I did, Helga?
Do you know what I did?
I killed Athelstan!
(HORSES GALLOPING)
Whoa!
Whoa.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Now take me to her.
Not until you tell me the purpose of your visit, the Queen will need to know.
Queen Kwenthrith knows perfectly well that the son of King Ecbert of Wessex wishes to speak to her.
She would certainly be ill-advised if she refused to meet me.
Look, you!
Do as you're told.
We might spare your life.
(URGES HORSE)
(DOOR OPENS)
ECBERT:
Judith.
You spoke before in the baths of the Romans.
I was surprised.
Most of our people know nothing about them.
I still know very little, but I was always curious.
I have some words here from the Romans themselves.
Athelstan helped me to translate them.
Athelstan?
(READING IN LATIN)
"Don't ask, we may never know, Leuconoe,
"what the gods plan for you and me.
"Leave the Chaldees to parse
"the sentence of the stars."
So strange.
As though he is here, talking to us now.
"Of expectation.
Life's short.
"Even while we talk, time, hateful, runs a mile.
"Don't trust tomorrow's bough for fruit,
"Pluck this, here, now."
Well, whoever wrote those words must be very wise.
Judith.
As long as there is breath in my body, I will protect you and your son, Alfred.
Believe me.
Hmm.

(AETHELWULF GRUNTS ANGRILY)
KWENTHRITH:
Prince Aethelwulf.
Do forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I was bathing.
Queen Kwenthrith, I bring a message from my father.
He condemns the murder of our nobles, who accompanied you here in good faith.
He insists that you reaffirm the status of Mercia as a client state of Wessex.
(GRUNTS) So much talk of business.
Come, now.
May I offer you a cup of wine?
To our alliance.
Oh.
There.
Now, come.
Sit.
(SIGHS)
So...
I'm quite happy to discuss these matters further.
What is there to discuss?
My father insists that...
My father, my father!
How old are you, Aethelwulf?
Mmm?
Do you always do what your father tells you?
Don't you have your own thoughts and your own feelings?
I have feelings of duty.
I try to do what is right for my country and for my God.
(LAUGHING)
Oh.
Do you know what I wonder?
I wonder what your father threatened to do to me.
Hmm.
Let's see.
Did he want to tear me apart?
Violate me?
Whip me?
Oh.
Whip?
Would you like to whip me?
Would it excite you?
Oh...
Come to my bed.
After all, why not enjoy what your father enjoyed?
Princess!
Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil.
Goodnight.
Sweet dreams.
Carry on!
Everything ready, Floki?
Yes.
Everything is ready.
Tomorrow we attack Paris.
SOLDIER:
Come.
KWENTHRITH:
Prince Aethelwulf?
May I present to you, my son,
Prince Magnus.
Hello, darling.
That is a Northern name, that is not one of ours.
Oh, clever you.
Yes, he's named after his father.
His father?
I think you may know him.
Ragnar Lothbrok.
Our nobles, before you killed them, never reported that you were with child, still less that the father was Ragnar Lothbrok.
Nevertheless, he is Ragnar's son.
And nothing will stop him from returning to these shores, both for Magnus and for his settlement.
We have destroyed his settlement.
Then he will return with vengeance upon you.
In which case, it will inconvenience us a great deal if he were to find a ready ally here in Mercia.
So whether or not this poor child is Ragnar's son, makes no difference.
He cannot help you.
And you can't threaten us with him.
(LAUGHS)
Guards.
(LAUGHING)
Queen Kwenthrith, you would be unwise to kill us.
It would give my father the very pretext he needs.
A pretext to invade Mercia and become its king.
He may even have been prepared to sacrifice me to attain his ends.
So, if you value your life, and that of your son, then I suggest you sign the documents we have brought with us, reaffirming the fact that Mercia is a vassal state of Wessex and must, in future, pay not only homage, but also taxes to Wessex
for the privilege.
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
(BELL TOLLING)
(FLOKI SPEAKING IN NATIVE TONGUE)
(CROWD CHANTING IN NATIVE TONGUE)
Previously on vikings...
Tell me about paris.
It has these walls all around.
This city is impregnable.
Give us the name of the father of your child?
Athelstan.
Athelstan.
Then you're a christian again?
With all my heart.
It is better that I leave kattegat now.
What do you mean?
You cannot leave!
You're the only one I can trust so you must stay.
Blood must be spilled.
A sacrifice be made.
My purpose is clear.
Lord, receive my soul.
There is nothing that can console me now.
Forgive me, my friend, not for what I have done.
But for what I am about to do.
Lord ragnar.
It is all very well to criticize others.
The progress of the northmen would have been frustrated
At every reach of the river.
But while others have neglected their responsibilities,
I have not been idle.
Paris has been prepared for this attack.
We are well-provisioned with food and water,
Enough to last the whole summer.
I am relieved to hear it.
To some extent,
We are at your mercy, count odo,
For you must protect us against these pagans.
Your highness, it is still not too late for you to leave the city.
Many here would urge you to save yourself.
Surely,
They would blame me for abandoning
Our capital at such a time?
Perhaps they would think it is a sensible precaution.
Allow me a moment to reflect, count odo.
Father?
Count odo thinks it might be a good idea for me to leave.
You must tell count odo that you have no intention of abandoning your people.
That whatever happens,
You will stay with them,
Be with them,
Protect them.
I am sure, father, that that was always your intention.
Count odo,
I am determined not to quit the city.
Not in its most urgent hour of need.
These next few days and weeks
Will test the faith of all of us.
I pray to god almighty that not one of us
Is found wanting
In either courage
Or belief.
Yours is a heavy burden,
Count odo.
You have many christian souls in your care.
I carry this burden with a light heart,
Knowing I share it with our lord, and with your highness.
But I must ask your highness if you have appealed to
Your brother, the eastern emperor, for help?
He could surely provide an army for our relief.
I will not ask either of my brothers for help.
I must prove myself better than my brothers, count odo,
And these northmen have provided the opportunity.
Defeat them,
And I will be seen as a worthy successor
To my grandfather,
To the great charlemagne.
So you see, count odo,
That your burden is...
Really much heavier than you imagined.
Raise shields!
Climb!
Climb aboard!
Row!
Row!
Mmm.
Forgive me
For asking, my son, but how is your marriage?
It's a marriage.
It is hard to forget what happened, and...
I try hard to forgive,
As our lord requires us to do.
"even those who trespass against us."
I'm glad to hear it.
There is something I wanted to ask you.
Judith is king aelle's daughter.
What does she think of her father?
And...
What would she think if we decided to overthrow him?
You would really do that?
Of course.
How else would I become bretwalda, king of kings?
King of all England.
Of course I must overthrow him.
I just wondered how upset your wife would be.
From what judith has told me, there is no love lost between them.
That is what I thought.
Do you plan to invade?
Not initially.
I have certain plans in place.
Various suggestions to invite chaos.
Including, perhaps, assassination.
My god!
Father, aelle is your ally and your friend.
Oh, no.
Not my friend.
I don't have any friends.
It's better that way.
Come here, alfred.
Come to your grandfather.
A magnificent boy!
I wonder how he is?
Who?
Athelstan.
It's that name again.
Why must you forever bring him to mind?
For when I think of that filthy apostate,
It reminds me of how my wife whored with him.
-And how much more she should have suffered for it.
-Aethelwulf!
This is not to do with you, father!
This is between me and this jezebel!
This harlot!
Leave.
Now.
Here.
You wanted to talk to me, ragnar?
I miss him.
Athelstan.
I wish he was here with us.
Since you carry his cross, he still is here with us.
He would have been useful.
We will manage without him.
Well.
We have no choice now.
Father, forgive me.
Holy father, forgive me.
For behold, I am a miserable sinner.
I must speak with the prince.
Prince aethelwulf!
Prince aethelwulf!
You have interrupted the sacred.
There is no excuse.
There is one, my lord.
Death waits for no man!
You sent nobles with queen kwenthrith, to look after our interests in mercia.
What happened to you?
Repudiated the contract she signed with us.
She wants to rule alone.
She tried to kill all of us that were sent to safeguard the interests of wessex.
She is quite mad.
Speak no more.
Rest, my lord.
I know we have had our differences of late.
Perhaps it is my fault, I have not been myself.
I want you to know, floki,
That I need you.
Now more than ever.
I've always
Believed in you.
That is why
I want you to be in command of this raid.
Me?
Sit, sit.
It's okay, sit.
King ragnar, we have reached paris.
-Now, we all want to know...
-Puh, puh, puh, puh...
The king...
My oldest friend has asked me to take command.
So...
How do we best attack the city?
Have taken a closer look at the city from further up the bank.
And we suggest a plan.
To mount simultaneous attacks both from the water and from the land.
I will lead an assault on the tower and the gates of the city.
We will attack the gates together.
I said I would lead the assault.
I will make that decision, if and when we need to make it.
I trust earl kalf to make it.
I don't think you were listening.
At the same time as the attack at the gates,
There will also be
A river-borne attack.
The ships will be filled with warriors and means of scaling,
We will climb up and gain entry to the city that way as well.
In which case, floki, you will be responsible for constructing
Whatever it is we need to scale these walls.
Oh, don't you worry about me, rollo.
I will make something truly astonishing.
Just wait and see.
All those who agree with the plan, say aye.
Aye!
Aye.
Let's hope the gods bless your efforts.
Please take her.
Take my baby.
What are you talking about?
I cannot care for her.
Of course you can.
I can't.
I want her to be like your sons.
I want her to be viking.
What does it matter what you call someone?
Whether she's viking or not viking is not important.
What is important is that you love and nurture her.
For if you are fortunate, she will grow up healthy.
And give you grandchildren to be proud of.
Think of bjorn.
I am...
This is why I want you to raise his daughter.
Bjorn loves you.
Bjorn will be much happier
And better off without me.
That is not true.
It is a very selfish thing to believe.
I cannot help it.
Your daughter needs you.
She needs her mother.
You must not talk this way.
Pray to freya.
Freya will comfort you as she comforts me.
We women bear heavy burdens.
But it is not to be helped.
And even when we are dealt with harshly,
Remember, it is the gods who have woven our destinies.
Not ourselves.
My son.
I have another mission for you on our behalf.
You must go to mercia and persuade queen kwenthrith
That her interests and ours are one and the same.
She has killed six of our nobles.
Yes.
That is certainly...
Unfortunate.
And she ought to be punished.
So much for gratitude.
What kind of a world do we live in,
When the friends of our friends, kill our friends?
But still, there is a way for this deluded queen to find some redemption.
There is?
My son,
Mercia has been weakened by years of civil wars.
She is no longer what she was, and must acknowledge the power of wessex.
Without wessex, mercia is now more than ever
At the mercy of the northmen.
As well as other saxon neighbors.
Like northumbria?
Precisely.
Like northumbria.
Yes.
Those closest, but unexpected, can sow a terrible harvest.
I charge you to go to mercia.
And tell the queen that she may be forgiven for slaughtering our nobles
But only if she begs mercy and reconfirms her subjugation to wessex.
If not,
We will show her the iron fist.
We will invade and we will destroy her,
And her limbs being fastened to four horses, her body will be torn apart.
Or something of that sort.
But also tell her that we have a repugnance for such measures,
Being christians.
Torvi...
Torvi, I should have spoken before.
Why?
You know why.
It doesn't matter.
I am not with child, neither am I a child.
I took advantage.
So did I.
Uh...
This is for you.
What's that?
Nothing.
-Let me see!
-No.
You are hurting me.
It's far too good for you.
Whore.
The northmen have been scouting the countryside, and our defenses.
We must expect an attack any day now.
I regret not sending you to safety in time.
It is much on my mind.
I did not want to be sent away.
I wanted to stay here with you.
There is nowhere I would rather be than here in paris,
Beside you, in your hour of need.
But I must tell you both,
I have been much about the city.
The people of paris are frightened to death by this pagan army.
So far, only their firm belief in god's grace and protection,
Prevents them from becoming hysterical and violent.
I am aware of the need to pacify and control the population.
Thank you, princess gisla.
Perhaps you yourself might help to reassure them
That we are well-protected, and have enough supplies to withstand a long siege.
Though, god willing, it will not come to that.
You may rely upon me to do everything possible to
Persuade the people of our ultimate victory.
Even your presence in the city, princess,
Helps them to believe in that.
Yet it is for my father to lead us to that victory.
Is it not, father?
I must to bed.
I am tired.
But I am glad we have had this conversation,
And I am also very glad that I have placed my faith in you, count odo,
As well as in god almighty,
For the successful outcome of this matter.
I must too go to bed.
Of course.
And yet I beg you to stay a moment and listen to me.
You once refused my offer of marriage.
What had I achieved?
What could I offer you?
But then I heard how many other offers of marriage you had declined,
From men far richer, far grander than me, and...
So, it gave me hope.
And my hope is that once I have successfully managed the defense of paris,
And the defeat of the northmen, and...
Gained a new and high reputation,
You will look again at my proposal?
If you save paris,
I will forever be in your debt.
But your first duty, count odo,
Is to concentrate on the defeat of the northmen.
On that, I am sure we both agree.
Higher up.
Pull again, pull again.
It needs to be more at an angle.
You must be hungry.
I have brought you something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
My work nourishes me.
I have so many responsibilities now, helga.
Everyone is depending on me.
My inventions will allow us to enter paris.
You will see, helga.
Our warriors will storm the walls
And we will all win the greatest renown.
Especially me.
Floki, the boat builder.
Floki, the tower maker.
But, of course...
It's not me making these towers.
It's the gods
Using my poor hands.
Do you know why they are helping me, helga?
Do you know why?
It's because I gave them a great sacrifice.
I appeased them.
I delighted them.
I filled them with joy.
Do you know what I did, helga?
Do you know what I did?
I killed athelstan!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Not until you tell me the purpose of your visit, the queen will need to know.
Queen kwenthrith knows perfectly well, that the son
Of king ecbert of wessex wishes to speak to her.

Do you always do what your father tells you?
Don't you have your own thoughts and your own feelings?
I have feelings of duty.
I try to do what is right.
For my country and for my god.
Oh.
Do you know what I wonder?
I wonder what your father threatened to do to me.
Hm...
Let's see.
Did he want to tear me apart?
Violate me?
Whip me?
Oh, whip?
Would you like to whip me?
Would it excite you?

Lead me not into temptation,
But deliver me from evil.
Goodnight.

Come.

May I present to you, my son,
Prince magnus.
Hello darling.
That is a northern name, that is not one of ours.
Oh, clever you.
Yes, he's named after his father.
His father?
I think you may know him.
Ragnar lothbrok.
Our nobles...
Before you killed them...
Never reported that you were with child,
Still less that the father was ragnar lothbrok.
Nevertheless, he is ragnar's son.
And nothing will stop him from returning to these shores
Both for magnus and for his settlement.
We have destroyed his settlement.
Then he will return
With vengeance upon you.
In which case, it will inconvenience us a great deal
If he were to find a ready ally here in mercia.
So whether or not this poor child is ragnar's son,
Makes no difference.
He cannot help you.
And you can't threaten us with him.
Guards!
Queen kwenthrith,
You would be unwise to kill us.
It would give my father the very pretext he needs.
A pretext to invade mercia
And become its king.
He may even have been prepared to sacrifice me
To attain his ends.
So, if you value your life,
Then I suggest you sign the documents we have brought with us,
Reaffirming the fact that mercia is a vassal state of wessex,
And must, in future, pay not only homage, but also taxes to wessex
For the privilege.
Everything ready, floki?
Yes.
Everything is ready.
Tomorrow we attack paris.

If they had agreed to act, the progress of the Northmen would have been frustrated at every reach of the river.
But, while others have neglected their responsibilities,

Not in its most urgent hour of need.
The next few days and weeks will test the faith of all of us.

And we suggest a plan.
To mount simultaneous attacks both from the water and from the land.
I will lead an assault on the tower and the gates of the city.
We will attack the gates together.
I said I would lead the assault.
We may need the tools Erlendur made.
I will make that decision, if and when we need to make it.
I trust Earl Kalf to make it.
I don't think you were listening.
At the same time as the attack at the gates, there will also be a river borne attack.
The ships will be filled with warriors and means of scaling, we will beach beneath the walls.
We will climb up and gain entry to the city that way as well.
In which case, Floki, you will be responsible for constructing whatever it is we need to scale these walls.
Don't you worry about me, Rollo.
I will make something truly astonishing.
Just wait and see.
All those who agree with the plan, say aye.
Aye!
Aye.
Let's hope the gods bless your efforts.
Please take her.
Take my baby.
What are you talking about?
I cannot care for her.
Of course you can.
I can't.
I want her to be like your sons.
I want her to be Viking.
What does it matter what you call someone?
Whether she's Viking or not Viking is not important.
What is important is that you love and nurture her.
For if you are fortunate, she will grow up healthy, and give you grandchildren to be proud of.
Think of Bjorn.
I am.
This is why I want you to raise his daughter.
Bjorn loves you.
Bjorn will be much happier and better off without me.
That is not true.
It is what I believe.
It is a very selfish thing to believe.
I cannot help it.
Your daughter needs you.
She needs her mother.
You must not talk this way.
Pray to Freya.
Freya will comfort you as she comforts me.
We women bear heavy burdens.
But it is not to be helped.
And even when we are dealt with harshly, remember, it is the gods who have woven our destinies.
Not ourselves.
My son,
I have another mission for you on our behalf.
You must go to Mercia and persuade Queen Kwenthrith that her interests and ours are one and the same.
She has killed six of our nobles.
Yes.
That is certainly unfortunate.
And she ought to be punished.
So much for gratitude.
What kind of a world do we live in, when the friends of our friends, kill our friends?
But, still, there is a way for this deluded Queen to find some redemption.
There is?
My son,
Mercia has been weakened by years of civil wars.
She is no longer what she was, and must acknowledge the power of Wessex.
Without Wessex, Mercia is now more than ever at the mercy of the Northmen.
As well as other Saxon neighbors.
Like Northumbria?
Precisely.
Like Northumbria.
Yes.
Those closest, but unexpected, can sow a terrible harvest.
I charge you to go to Mercia and tell the Queen that she may be forgiven for slaughtering our nobles, but only if she begs mercy and reconfirms her subjugation to Wessex.
If not, we will show her the iron fist.
We will invade and we will destroy her, and her limbs being fastened to four horses, her body will be torn apart.
Or something of that sort.
But, also, tell her that we have a repugnance for such measures, being Christians.
Torvi.
Torvi, I should have spoken before.
Why?
You know why.
It doesn't matter.
I am not with child, neither am I a child.
I took advantage.
So did I.
Uh...
This is for you.
What's that?
Nothing.
Let me see!
No.
You are hurting me.
It's far too good for you.
Whore!
The Northmen have been scouting the countryside, and our defenses.
We must expect an attack any day now.
Gisla, I regret not sending you to safety in time.
It is much on my mind.
I did not want to be sent away.
I wanted to stay here with you.
There is nowhere I would rather be than here in Paris, beside you, in your hour of need.
But I must tell you both,
I have been much about the city.
The people of Paris are frightened to death by this pagan army.
So far, only their firm belief in God's grace and protection, prevents them from becoming hysterical and violent.
I am aware of the need to pacify and control the population.
Thank you, Princess Gisla.
Perhaps you yourself might have to reassure them that we are well protected, and have enough supplies to withstand a long siege.
Though, God willing, it will not come to that.
You may rely upon me to do everything possible to persuade the people of our ultimate victory.
Even your presence in the city, Princess, helps them to believe in that.
Yet it is for my father to lead us to that victory.
Is it not, Father?
I must to bed.
I am tired.
But I am glad we have had this conversation.
And I am also very glad that I have placed my faith in you, Count Odo, as well as in God Almighty, for the successful outcome of this matter.
I must, too, go to bed.
Of course.
And yet, I beg you to stay a moment and listen to me.
You once refused my offer of marriage.
What did I achieve?
What could I offer you?
But then, I heard how many other offers of marriage you had declined, from men far richer, far grander than me, and...
So, it gave me hope.
And my hope is that once I have successfully managed the defense of Paris, and the defeat of the Northmen, and gained a new and high reputation, you will look again at my proposal.
If you save Paris,
I will forever be in your debt.
But your first duty, Count Odo, is to concentrate on the defeat of the Northmen.
On that, I am sure we both agree.
Higher up.
Pull again, pull again.
It needs to be more on an angle.
Lend me a hand.
You must be hungry.
I have brought you something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
My work nourishes me.
I have so many responsibilities now, Helga.
Everyone is depending on me.
My inventions will allow us to enter Paris.
You will see, Helga.
Our warriors will storm the walls and we will all win the greatest renown.
Especially me.
Floki, the boat builder.
Floki, the tower maker.
But, of course, it's not me making these towers.
It's the gods using my poor hands.
Do you know why they are helping me, Helga?
Do you know why?
It's because I gave them a great sacrifice.
I appeased them.
I delighted them.
I filled them with joy.
Do you know what I did, Helga?
Do you know what I did?
I killed Athelstan!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Now take me to her.
Not until you tell me the purpose of your visit, the Queen will need to know.
Queen Kwenthrith knows perfectly well that the son of King Ecbert of Wessex wishes to speak to her.
She would certainly be ill-advised if she refused to meet me.
Look, you!
Do as you're told.
We might spare your life.
Judith.
You spoke before in the baths of the Romans.
I was surprised.
Most of our people know nothing about them.
I still know very little, but I was always curious.
I have some words here from the Romans themselves.
Athelstan helped me to translate them.
Athelstan?
"Don't ask, we may never know, Leuconoe,
"what the gods plan for you and me.
"Leave the Chaldees to parse
"the sentence of the stars."
So strange.
As though he is here, talking to us now.
"Of expectation.
Life's short.
"Even while we talk, time, hateful, runs a mile.
"Don't trust tomorrow's bough for fruit,
"Pluck this, here, now."
Well, whoever wrote those words must be very wise.
Judith.
As long as there is breath in my body, I will protect you and your son, Alfred.
Believe me.
Hmm.
Prince Aethelwulf.
Do forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I was bathing.
Queen Kwenthrith, I bring a message from my father.
He condemns the murder of our nobles, who accompanied you here in good faith.
He insists that you reaffirm the status of Mercia as a client state of Wessex.
So much talk of business.
Come, now.
May I offer you a cup of wine?
To our alliance.
Oh.
There.
Now, come.
Sit.
So...
I'm quite happy to discuss these matters further.
What is there to discuss?
My father insists that...
My father, my father!
How old are you, Aethelwulf?
Mmm?
Do you always do what your father tells you?
Don't you have your own thoughts and your own feelings?
I have feelings of duty.
I try to do what is right for my country and for my God.
Oh.
Do you know what I wonder?
I wonder what your father threatened to do to me.
Hmm.
Let's see.
Did he want to tear me apart?
Violate me?
Whip me?
Oh.
Whip?
Would you like to whip me?
Would it excite you?
Oh...
Come to my bed.
After all, why not enjoy what your father enjoyed?
Princess!
Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil.
Goodnight.
Sweet dreams.
Carry on!
Everything ready, Floki?
Yes.
Everything is ready.
Tomorrow we attack Paris.
Come.
Prince Aethelwulf?
May I present to you, my son,
Prince Magnus.
Hello, darling.
That is a Northern name, that is not one of ours.
Oh, clever you.
Yes, he's named after his father.
His father?
I think you may know him.
Ragnar Lothbrok.
Our nobles, before you killed them, never reported that you were with child, still less that the father was Ragnar Lothbrok.
Nevertheless, he is Ragnar's son.
And nothing will stop him from returning to these shores, both for Magnus and for his settlement.
We have destroyed his settlement.
Then he will return with vengeance upon you.
In which case, it will inconvenience us a great deal if he were to find a ready ally here in Mercia.
So whether or not this poor child is Ragnar's son, makes no difference.
He cannot help you.
And you can't threaten us with him.
Guards.
Queen Kwenthrith, you would be unwise to kill us.
It would give my father the very pretext he needs.
A pretext to invade Mercia and become its king.
He may even have been prepared to sacrifice me to attain his ends.
So, if you value your life, and that of your son, then I suggest you sign the documents we have brought with us, reaffirming the fact that Mercia is a vassal state of Wessex and must, in future, pay not only homage, but also taxes to Wessex
for the privilege.
Lord Ragnar.

It is all very well to criticize others.
If they had agreed to act, the progress of the Northmen would have been frustrated at every reach of the river.
But, while others have neglected their responsibilities, I have not been idle.
Paris has been prepared for this attack.
We are well-provisioned with food and water, enough to last the whole summer.
I am relieved to hear it.
To some extent, we are at your mercy, Count Odo, for you must protect us against these pagans.
Your Highness, it is still not too late for you to leave the city.
Many here would urge you to save yourself.
Surely, they would blame me for abandoning our capital at such a time.
Perhaps they would think it is a sensible precaution.
Allow me a moment to reflect, Count Odo.
- Sire.
- Your Highness.
Father?
Count Odo thinks it might be a good idea for me to leave.
You must tell Count Odo that you have no intention of abandoning your people.
That whatever happens, you will stay with them, be with them, protect them.
I am sure, Father, that that was always your intention.
Count Odo,
I am determined not to quit the city.
Not in its most urgent hour of need.
The next few days and weeks will test the faith of all of us.
I pray to God Almighty that not one of us is found wanting in either courage or belief.
Yours is a heavy burden, Count Odo.
You have many Christian souls in your care.
I carry this burden with a light heart, knowing I share it with our Lord, and with Your Highness.
But I must ask Your Highness if you have appealed to your brother, the Eastern Emperor, for help?
He could surely provide an army for our relief.
I will not ask either of my brothers for help!
I must prove myself better than my brothers, Count Odo, and these Northmen have provided the opportunity.
Defeat them, and I will be seen as a worthy successor to my grandfather, to the Great Charlemagne.
So you see, Count Odo, that your burden is really much heavier than you imagined.
Raise shields!
Turn!
Turn the boat!
Turn!
Row!
Forgive me for asking, my son, but how is your marriage?
It's a marriage.
It is hard to forget what happened, and
I try hard to forgive, as our Lord requires us to do.
Even those who trespass against us.
I'm glad to hear it.
There is something I wanted to ask you.
Judith is King Aelle's daughter.
What does she think of her father?
And what would she think if we decided to overthrow him?
- You would really do that?
- Of course.
How else would I become Bretwalda, king of kings,
King of all England?
Of course I must overthrow him.
I just wondered how upset your wife would be.
From what Judith has told me, there is no love lost between them.
That is what I thought.
Do you plan to invade?
Not initially.
I have certain plans in place.
Various suggestions to invite chaos.
Including, perhaps, assassination.
My God!
Father, Aelle is your ally and your friend.
Oh, no.
Not my friend.
I don't have any friends.
It's better that way.
Come here, Alfred.
Come to your grandfather.
What a magnificent boy!
I wonder how he is?
- Who?
- Athelstan.
It's that name again.
Why must you forever bring him to mind?
For when I think of that filthy apostate, it reminds me how my wife whored with him.
And how much more she should have suffered for it.
- Aethelwulf!
- This is not to do with you, Father!
This is between me and this jezebel!
This harlot!
Leave.
Now.
Here.
You wanted to talk to me, Ragnar?
I miss him.
Athelstan.
I wish he was here with us.
Since you carry his cross, he still is here with us.
- He would have been useful.
- We will manage without him.
We have no choice now.
Father, forgive me.
Holy Father, forgive me.
For, behold, I am a miserable sinner.
I must speak with the prince.
Prince Aethelwulf!
Prince Aethelwulf!
You have interrupted the sacred.
- There is no excuse.
- There is one, My Lord.
Death waits for no man.
Who is this?
You sent nobles with Queen Kwenthrith, to look after our interests in Mercia.
What happened to you?
The Queen repudiated the contract she signed with us.
She wants to rule alone.
She tried to kill all of us that were sent to safeguard the interests of Wessex.
- She is quite mad.
- Speak no more.
Rest, My Lord.
I know we have had our differences of late.
Perhaps it is my fault, I have not been myself.
I want you to know, Floki, that I need you.
Now, more than ever.
And I've always believed in you.
That is why
I want you to be in command of this raid.
- Me?
- Sit, sit.
Take it.
Sit.
King Ragnar, we have reached Paris.
Now,
- we all want to know...
- **
The king, my oldest friend, has asked me to take command.
So, uh...
How do we best attack the city?

Here.
You wanted to talk to me, Ragnar?
I miss him.
Athelstan.
I wish he was here with us.
Since you carry his cross, he still is here with us.
He would have been useful.
We will manage without him.
Well.
We have no choice now.
Father, forgive me.
Holy Father, forgive me.
For, behold, I am a miserable sinner.
I must speak with the prince.
Prince Aethelwulf!
Prince Aethelwulf!
You have interrupted the sacred.
There is no excuse.
There is one, My Lord.
Death waits for no man.
Who is this?
You sent nobles with Queen Kwenthrith, to look after our interests in Mercia.
What happened to you?
The Queen repudiated the contract she signed with us.
She wants to rule alone.
She tried to kill all of us that were sent to safeguard the interests of Wessex.
She is quite mad.
Speak no more.
Rest, My Lord.
I know we have had our differences of late.
Perhaps it is my fault, I have not been myself.
I want you to know, Floki, that I need you.
Now, more than ever.
And I've always believed in you.
That is why
I want you to be in command of this raid.
Me?
Sit, sit.
Take it.
Sit.
King Ragnar, we have reached Paris.
Now, we all want to know...
The king, my oldest friend, has asked me to take command.
So, uh...
How do we best attack the city?
Some of us have taken a closer look at the city from further up the bank.
And we suggest a plan.
To mount simultaneous attacks both from the water and from the land.
I will lead an assault on the tower and the gates of the city.
We will attack the gates together.
I said I would lead the assault.
We may need the tools Erlendur made.
I will make that decision, if and when we need to make it.
I trust Earl Kalf to make it.
I don't think you were listening.
At the same time as the attack at the gates, there will also be a river borne attack.
The ships will be filled with warriors and means of scaling, we will beach beneath the walls.
We will climb up and gain entry to the city that way as well.
In which case, Floki, you will be responsible for constructing whatever it is we need to scale these walls.
Don't you worry about me, Rollo.
I will make something truly astonishing.
Just wait and see.
All those who agree with the plan, say aye.
Aye!
Aye.
Let's hope the gods bless your efforts.
Please take her.
Take my baby.
What are you talking about?
I cannot care for her.
Of course you can.
I can't.
I want her to be like your sons.
I want her to be Viking.
What does it matter what you call someone?
Whether she's Viking or not Viking is not important.
What is important is that you love and nurture her.
For if you are fortunate, she will grow up healthy, and give you grandchildren to be proud of.
Think of Bjorn.
I am.
This is why I want you to raise his daughter.
Bjorn loves you.
Bjorn will be much happier and better off without me.
That is not true.
It is what I believe.
It is a very selfish thing to believe.
I cannot help it.
Your daughter needs you.
She needs her mother.
You must not talk this way.
Pray to Freya.
Freya will comfort you as she comforts me.
We women bear heavy burdens.
But it is not to be helped.
And even when we are dealt with harshly, remember, it is the gods who have woven our destinies.
Not ourselves.
My son,
I have another mission for you on our behalf.
You must go to Mercia and persuade Queen Kwenthrith that her interests and ours are one and the same.
She has killed six of our nobles.
Yes.
That is certainly unfortunate.
And she ought to be punished.
So much for gratitude.
What kind of a world do we live in, when the friends of our friends, kill our friends?
But, still, there is a way for this deluded Queen to find some redemption.
There is?
My son,
Mercia has been weakened by years of civil wars.
She is no longer what she was, and must acknowledge the power of Wessex.
Without Wessex, Mercia is now more than ever at the mercy of the Northmen.
As well as other Saxon neighbors.
Like Northumbria?
Precisely.
Like Northumbria.
Yes.
Those closest, but unexpected, can sow a terrible harvest.
I charge you to go to Mercia and tell the Queen that she may be forgiven for slaughtering our nobles, but only if she begs mercy and reconfirms her subjugation to Wessex.
If not, we will show her the iron fist.
We will invade and we will destroy her, and her limbs being fastened to four horses, her body will be torn apart.
Or something of that sort.
But, also, tell her that we have a repugnance for such measures, being Christians.
Torvi.
Torvi, I should have spoken before.
Why?
You know why.
It doesn't matter.
I am not with child, neither am I a child.
I took advantage.
So did I.
Uh...
This is for you.
What's that?
Nothing.
Let me see!
No.
You are hurting me.
It's far too good for you.
Whore!
The Northmen have been scouting the countryside, and our defenses.
We must expect an attack any day now.
Gisla, I regret not sending you to safety in time.
It is much on my mind.
I did not want to be sent away.
I wanted to stay here with you.
There is nowhere I would rather be than here in Paris, beside you, in your hour of need.
But I must tell you both,
I have been much about the city.
The people of Paris are frightened to death by this pagan army.
So far, only their firm belief in God's grace and protection, prevents them from becoming hysterical and violent.
I am aware of the need to pacify and control the population.
Thank you, Princess Gisla.
Perhaps you yourself might have to reassure them that we are well protected, and have enough supplies to withstand a long siege.
Though, God willing, it will not come to that.
You may rely upon me to do everything possible to persuade the people of our ultimate victory.
Even your presence in the city, Princess, helps them to believe in that.
Yet it is for my father to lead us to that victory.
Is it not, Father?
I must to bed.
I am tired.
But I am glad we have had this conversation.
And I am also very glad that I have placed my faith in you, Count Odo, as well as in God Almighty, for the successful outcome of this matter.
I must, too, go to bed.
Of course.
And yet, I beg you to stay a moment and listen to me.
You once refused my offer of marriage.
What did I achieve?
What could I offer you?
But then, I heard how many other offers of marriage you had declined, from men far richer, far grander than me, and...
So, it gave me hope.
And my hope is that once I have successfully managed the defense of Paris, and the defeat of the Northmen, and gained a new and high reputation, you will look again at my proposal.
If you save Paris,
I will forever be in your debt.
But your first duty, Count Odo, is to concentrate on the defeat of the Northmen.
On that, I am sure we both agree.
Higher up.
Pull again, pull again.
It needs to be more on an angle.
Lend me a hand.
You must be hungry.
I have brought you something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
My work nourishes me.
I have so many responsibilities now, Helga.
Everyone is depending on me.
My inventions will allow us to enter Paris.
You will see, Helga.
Our warriors will storm the walls and we will all win the greatest renown.
Especially me.
Floki, the boat builder.
Floki, the tower maker.
But, of course, it's not me making these towers.
It's the gods using my poor hands.
Do you know why they are helping me, Helga?
Do you know why?
It's because I gave them a great sacrifice.
I appeased them.
I delighted them.
I filled them with joy.
Do you know what I did, Helga?
Do you know what I did?
I killed Athelstan!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Now take me to her.
Not until you tell me the purpose of your visit, the Queen will need to know.
Queen Kwenthrith knows perfectly well that the son of King Ecbert of Wessex wishes to speak to her.
She would certainly be ill-advised if she refused to meet me.
Look, you!
Do as you're told.
We might spare your life.
Judith.
You spoke before in the baths of the Romans.
I was surprised.
Most of our people know nothing about them.
I still know very little, but I was always curious.
I have some words here from the Romans themselves.
Athelstan helped me to translate them.
Athelstan?
"Don't ask, we may never know, Leuconoe,
"what the gods plan for you and me.
"Leave the Chaldees to parse
"the sentence of the stars."
So strange.
As though he is here, talking to us now.
"Of expectation.
Life's short.
"Even while we talk, time, hateful, runs a mile.
"Don't trust tomorrow's bough for fruit,
"Pluck this, here, now."
Well, whoever wrote those words must be very wise.
Judith.
As long as there is breath in my body, I will protect you and your son, Alfred.
Believe me.
Hmm.
Prince Aethelwulf.
Do forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I was bathing.
Queen Kwenthrith, I bring a message from my father.
He condemns the murder of our nobles, who accompanied you here in good faith.
He insists that you reaffirm the status of Mercia as a client state of Wessex.
So much talk of business.
Come, now.
May I offer you a cup of wine?
To our alliance.
Oh.
There.
Now, come.
Sit.
So...
I'm quite happy to discuss these matters further.
What is there to discuss?
My father insists that...
My father, my father!
How old are you, Aethelwulf?
Mmm?
Do you always do what your father tells you?
Don't you have your own thoughts and your own feelings?
I have feelings of duty.
I try to do what is right for my country and for my God.
Oh.
Do you know what I wonder?
I wonder what your father threatened to do to me.
Hmm.
Let's see.
Did he want to tear me apart?
Violate me?
Whip me?
Oh.
Whip?
Would you like to whip me?
Would it excite you?
Oh...
Come to my bed.
After all, why not enjoy what your father enjoyed?
Princess!
Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil.
Goodnight.
Sweet dreams.
Carry on!
Everything ready, Floki?
Yes.
Everything is ready.
Tomorrow we attack Paris.
Come.
Prince Aethelwulf?
May I present to you, my son,
Prince Magnus.
Hello, darling.
That is a Northern name, that is not one of ours.
Oh, clever you.
Yes, he's named after his father.
His father?
I think you may know him.
Ragnar Lothbrok.
Our nobles, before you killed them, never reported that you were with child, still less that the father was Ragnar Lothbrok.
Nevertheless, he is Ragnar's son.
And nothing will stop him from returning to these shores, both for Magnus and for his settlement.
We have destroyed his settlement.
Then he will return with vengeance upon you.
In which case, it will inconvenience us a great deal if he were to find a ready ally here in Mercia.
So whether or not this poor child is Ragnar's son, makes no difference.
He cannot help you.
And you can't threaten us with him.
Guards.
Queen Kwenthrith, you would be unwise to kill us.
It would give my father the very pretext he needs.
A pretext to invade Mercia and become its king.
He may even have been prepared to sacrifice me to attain his ends.
So, if you value your life, and that of your son, then I suggest you sign the documents we have brought with us, reaffirming the fact that Mercia is a vassal state of Wessex and must, in future, pay not only homage, but also taxes to Wessex
for the privilege.
Previously on Broadchurch...
There were two girls.
Lisa Newbery, 19, was babysitting for her 12-year-old cousin, Pippa.
Pippa's parents went away for the night to a friend's wedding.
When they came back the next day, both girls were gone.
Pippa, the 12-year-old, she was found three days later.
Lisa...
Officially, she's still missing.
Our main suspect was a man called Lee Ashworth.
But he had a solid alibi.
Lee's my husband.
You have to be satisfied that you are sure of the defendant's guilt.
You are the judges of fact.
You must put aside any emotion and approach this in a cold, analytical way.
They're saying I might be the killer.
You're saying Pippa's pendant actually belonged to Claire?
You took this?
You had this all along?
There's a verdict.
The jury are coming back in.
- Have you reached a verdict on this defendant?
- Yes.
Is this the verdict of you all, or as a majority?
A majority.
Will the defendant please stand.
Do you find the defendant, Joseph Michael Miller, guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
Mr Miller, you have been found not guilty.
You're free to leave the dock.
Thank you, my lady.
Members of the jury, thank you for your careful attention to the facts and for delivering your verdict.
You have discharged your duties honourably.
This has been...
This has been an extremely difficult and distressing case, and as such, this court excuses you all from any future jury duty.
Thank you.
You OK?
Claire Ripley, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Pippa Gillespie and Lisa Newbery.
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence
- if you don't mention...
- All rise.
...which you later rely on in court.
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.
Do you understand?
Right, go.
Argh!
- How is that justice?
- It's not.
Go and be with your family.
I want to kill him, Ell.
I know.
Me too.
Come with me.
Come on.
What does it take to destroy lives forever?
12 people.
12 ordinary, stupid, easily-swayed, hard-of-thinking arseholes.
Alec, I'm so sorry.
I arrested this woman at 2:32pm.
She is aware she's under caution.
I need you to take her to the nick.
Sort out an interview room?
Yeah, I rang the custody suite at Broadchurch.
I'll sit in with you.
No, no.
I need Miller.
- Yeah.
Course you do.
- Claire just handed me this pendant.
You two should have plenty to talk about.
- Any restrictions on where he can go?
- Not now that he's been found not guilty.
How do we get him back in court?
He killed Danny and he's got off by playing the system.
You can't appeal once someone has been acquitted, unless compelling new evidence comes forward.
- I don't believe this.
- So this is what happens.
Our lives get put through hell, and a guilty man walks free.
Mark, I'm...
I'm so sorry.
- Where do you think Dad's gonna go?
- Don't worry, you'll be safe.
I've asked one of the uniform lads to swing by Lucy's, just in case he comes over.
- Has he still got keys to your place?
- I changed the locks months ago.
We'll get through this.
OK?
It's gonna be all right, Mum.
How are the family taking it?
Maybe you should've asked that before you took on the case.
Oh, please don't be a sore loser.
And don't be a shitty winner!
I trained you so much better than this.
All the people you could've helped, and you take on a tawdry child killer.
All I ever wanted was for you to prove me wrong, and show the world how brilliant you were.
No, you wanted a mini you.
You know the difference between us?
I don't see the nobility in this job.
I see a loaded, lopsided game... full of people justifying their cynicism as a higher calling.
It's street-fighting in wigs.
That's all.
There are wins that help you sleep at night...
others that keep you awake.
I'd stock up on the sleeping pills.
Right, Miller, listen to me.
See that anger you're feeling?
That rage?
That's how I woke up every day for the past two years, knowing Lee Ashworth got off.
- Don't try and tell me I should try and let it go.
- Oh, I don't want you to let it go.
I want you to stoke it.
I want it to burn in you, like it does in me.
I need someone as angry as me right now.
Cos we're gonna close the case on Claire and Lee Ashworth, today.
Together.
- After today, if you think I'm gonna go with you...
- Yeah, I do.
You can't change what happened, but you can make sure another killer goes down.
That fury is fuel.
Do something with it.
The pendant is the lever to get them to confess.
We're gonna go in hard on them.
Let's work that verdict off on two very deserving people.
Ripped By mstoll
- Yeah?
- Claire's in custody.
We've reason to believe she has a piece of evidence relating to Lisa and Pippa's deaths.
- What evidence?
- I can't talk.
I'm heading over there now.
Erm, she turned down a solicitor.
She came to me.
Said she wanted us to know the truth now.
You haven't had a falling out, have you?
Just do me a favour.
Don't leave the area.
I'm sure I'll want to talk to you very soon.
You ready?
- It was Joe.
- No.
Time to stop playing games.
I need your help.
No.
I've been found innocent.
You have to help me come home.
Tell me how you came to have Pippa Gillespie's pendant, Claire.
Have you arrested Lee yet?
Is that what this is about?
You brought us the pendant as a way of sending a message to Lee?
Why did you tell my husband I was pregnant or that I'd had an abortion, when I told you in confidence?
That's a breach of trust.
You wanna talk about trust?
You want to talk about how the Gillespies trusted you to take their daughter to school?
What did you do on those journeys?
Start grooming her for Lee?
Was that it?
Why did you force me to have sex with you, Alec?
We have never had sex, Claire.
Why have you been holding me against my will, Alec?
Is there any truth to this?
Of course there bloody isn't.
You asked me to help you, because you were worried that your husband would come after you.
You hurt me physically, Alec.
You were sad because your wife had another man's cock in her mouth, but you shouldn't have held me prisoner and forced me to have sex with you.
- I need to stop the interview.
- Don't touch that.
- I have to take these allegations seriously...
- Sit down, Miller!
You want to keep going with these allegations?
Fill your boots.
GO on.
We'll stop now, you can report those offences, I'll be arrested.
You want that?
We can do that.
Say the word.
But that's not why you're here, is it?
You're here because of Lee.
So what are you thinking?
We bring Lee in, he gets a fright seeing that and then, instead of betraying you you're banking on him realising he needs to stay close to you because of what you know.
I don't know anything.
I don't.
You know what happened to Lisa Newbery and Pippa Gillespie.
- You're wrong.
- I don't think I am.
Not when I look in your eyes.
I'm not scared of you, Alec.
Yeah, well, you should be.
Why have you got Ricky Gillespie's office number in the mobile DI Hardy gave you?
Oh, hello, you're piping up now, are you?
Had a little peek at my phone, did you?
Thank you for that.
Mate!
Why would you be calling Pippa's dad?
Did Ricky send you the bluebell?
Oh, he did!
Why's Ricky got a picture of bluebells on his office wall?
Has he?
- What happened that night, Claire?
- Don't know.
- You're kidding me.
- Shh.
He can't be here.
He said it's the only place he can go.
No, I mean he can't come back to this town.
Well, I've told him that.
So what did you call me for?
Because I need to tell someone else what I'm gonna do.
How are we meant to survive this?
I know what we have to do.
I just don't know how we do it.
What do you mean?
If the system won't give us justice, then we have to do it ourselves.
- I'm gonna break her in there.
- You're too emotionally wound up.
Me?
Have you ever met yourself?
I will do whatever it takes to get those two in prison.
Stop fiddling with that.
Something is bugging me.
What?
Oh, perfect.
Stay there.
OK.
I need someone to go to Lee and Claire's and get a photograph.
All right, talk to Tess.
I've got to do something.
Come on!
Where is it?
Where's what, Lee?
Before I called you, I had someone following you.
Lee Ashworth, I'm arresting you in connection with the murders of Pippa Gillespie and Lisa Newbery.
Paul?
Paul?
Mark...
Paul!
Paul!
Help!
Help!
Yeah, course I'm happy.
Just want to go home.
Yeah, I've got to go.
- I brought gin.
- Go away.
I can take a loss.
But this one mattered.
Now the whole town knows I failed.
It hurts.
Yes, well, life does.
I never said being back in the world would be painless.
I want to make it right for them, Maggie, and I can't.
No.
None of us can now.
Do you think they'll be strong enough?
This what you were after?
- That was quick!
- I'm really good.
Yes, look.
See, there it is.
That and that.
Which also makes sense of these two receipts.
Oh, Miller, that is outstanding!
So, I found this at the bottom of the old case files.
What was it for?
Stock for a job I was doing the following Monday.
Oak boards.
So you bought this Saturday morning, the exact amount, everything you needed?
Yeah.
And then I done the job on Monday.
Yeah, I know, I checked.
So, why did you go back to the same supply yard, first thing Monday morning, and buy the exact same stock again?
What?
A second, identical purchase.
Nobody thought to query it.
Obviously, I'm a bit more fussy.
What happened to the stuff bought on Saturday?
Why did you have to buy it all over again?
I didn't get enough.
This was taken a week before, just as you were installing your own floor.
Those boards are not the same boards that are down on that floor now, Lee.
Those are dark oak floorboards.
What's down there now is light oak.
The same light oak boards you bought Saturday morning and again Monday morning.
What did you use those boards for, Lee, between Saturday and Monday?
What happened on the floor, Lee?
Nothing.
No, something did.
What were you looking for at the cottage, Lee?
Is this what you were looking for?
For the tape, DI Hardy is showing Mr Ashworth a clear plastic evidence bag
- AH/1 - containing a pendant.
Where did you get it from?
- From your wife.
- What?
This is the evidence that proves Pippa Gillespie was in your car the night she died.
This is the missing evidence that nearly killed me.
And now I've got it.
You know what I think this was?
Her insurance policy.
She didn't trust you.
Just like you never should've trusted her.
She has stitched you up.
And she never told you about the baby.
I get it.
When you're in love, you think you're gonna be interlocked forever.
Love's all-encompassing when you're in it, but really, you can't trust anyone.
Not even the people you love.
Ultimately...we're all alone.
You more than anyone right now.
So set the record straight and we can all get released from this.
Come on, you must be so tired of lying.
No-one's coming to your rescue.
You're on your own.
This is it.
Last chance.
Did you kill Lisa Newbery?
Why won't he leave me alone?
- Where's Pippa?
- She's asleep.
- I should probably get back to her.
- No, go get her, bring her over.
You can both stay here till he's gone.
I was just walking past.
Do you have to be such a wanker?
- Oh!
Shit!
- Get back to burning your animals!
- Argh!
- Oh, get off me!
Look at that!
You punched me.
Final warning.
Stay away from her.
- But I love her.
- Get over it, or I'll break your leg.
Go on.
Jog on.
You hit him?
Yeah, well, it's quicker than talking.
He did get a bit of a nosebleed, though, poor sod.
You got blood on your shirt.
Yeah.
- Where's Pippa?
- She's asleep in your bed.
She barely woke up.
You had sex with Lisa Newbery that night?
All this time you've been denying it.
Then what?
You killed her?
No.
Claire.
You don't have a clue.
Ricky came home from the wedding?
- Get your clothes on!
- Calm down!
- Where's Pippa?
- Upstairs.
- We trusted you to look after her!
- Lee was helping me.
That's shit.
I've been out there 15 minutes.
- You've been watching us?
- I've seen...
- You dirty old bastard!
- Lisa!
- What did you call me?
- You're pissed.
Just calm down.
- I've seen you looking...
- What?
You're just pissed off that I fucked him instead of you.
- Is that how you talk to me?
- Stop it!
- No!
Get off me!
- Call me a bastard again!
Where was Claire?
This little box...contains Lee's taped evidence.
You are lying, Claire.
You've lied and changed your story a dozen times, and blamed everyone but yourself.
Well, now it's time to tell the truth.
Lee's told us Ricky killed Lisa.
But what happened to Pippa?
It's me!
You here?
Hey.
What are you doing here, sweetheart?
- What's wrong?
- I think there's been an accident.
- What do you mean...?
- Hey, Pippa, you should be asleep.
- I thought you were at a wedding.
- ls Lisa all right?
No, no, no, baby, she's not.
She's...
- I'm afraid Lee's really hurt her.
- What?
What?
No.
You shouldn't be here.
Claire, I need you to go to Pippa and sit with her.
I've told her you'll bring her some medicine to calm her down.
Here.
Claire.
Claire.
Give her some of that.
It'll help her sleep.
I'll deal with her in the morning.
- Claire's not part of this...
- Shut up.
You're all over her body.
You're inside her.
Her blood's on your floor.
I'll go and get the van.
You clean up in here.
You go to the police, and I'll put it all on you.
Claire.
You can't give her that.
You can't give Pippa that.
He told me that when he goes out to bars and clubs he puts Rohypnol in there.
- We've gotta go to the police.
- Did you have sex with her'?
Did you have sex with her, Lee?
What have you done?
Come here.
How long were you sitting on the stairs?
Hm?
Come on...
It's all right.
I won't tell anyone, I promise.
Had you been there long?
Yeah?
Was the door open?
But you heard something?
- I heard Lisa and Lee.
- Oh.
They were having sex.
And then I heard the fight.
OK.
OK.
Thank you for telling me the truth, sweetheart.
Lee hurt Lisa.
My dad said.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Hey.
Thank you for being honest.
You've done really well.
Now, I don't want you to worry.
You just need to rest.
Your dad has left you something.
Bit of medicine just to...calm you down help you sleep, while we get all this sorted out.
I want you to take a big gulp of that.
A big gulp of that.
That's a good girl.
Well done.
- I don't like it.
- No, it's horrible, isn't it?
Medicine always is.
But it's gonna help everything.
Snuggle down now.
Come on, snuggle down.
Snug as a bug.
I'm just downstairs.
I'm worried about Lisa.
Everything's gonna be all right.
We've got to clear this mess up.
Pippa heard you having sex.
She thinks you killed Lisa.
Did you give her that stuff from the flask?
She'll be asleep now.
What are you doing?
Where's Pippa?
Look, I'll explain.
We haven't got much time.
Just drive.
Just drive!
- You need to...
- Claire!
What are we doing here?
Where's Pippa?
Claire, you tell me where she is!
Stop.
Stop!
- Where is Pippa?
- You need to stay calm.
Right?
I gave her the stuff from your flask, like you said.
- Right?
- What was in there?
Not just whisky, was it?
- What happened?
- She had a reaction.
She said she couldn't breathe.
She was choking.
- It was...
It was just...
It was just so, so fast.
- What are you telling me?
We couldn't call an ambulance, Ricky, not with Lisa's blood all over the floor.
We...couldn't save her.
She's gone.
No.
- No.
- I'm so sorry.
No, don't say that.
Don't say that.
OK, Lee said he knows somewhere...
somewhere peaceful, where you used to go, somewhere she won't be found for a while.
That's why we're here.
OK?
You can go and look and I'll wait here.
I'll wait here.
I'll wait here.
Ricky.
Give me the keys.
Listen.
I've got to tell you this.
I've buried your hip flask in the woods here.
I know exactly where, but nobody else will be able to find it.
If you feel you want to talk to the police, or you blame us for this, remember, I know where your hip flask is that contains traces that's killed Pippa.
It's just a precaution.
That's all.
Nothing else.
You've thought it all through, haven't you?
I've got to think of the future.
I only came home that night to tell him I was pregnant.
We've got a pretty clear picture of the events of that night.
But we want to hear it from you.
We know you killed Lisa.
But where did you bury her body?
- No comment.
- No, no, no, no, don't do that.
Cate broke your alibi weeks ago.
There were hours when she didn't see you at the wedding.
She assumed you were off sleeping with a bridesmaid
- Tiffany Evans.
But we spoke to Tiffany.
She said otherwise.
And I did a lot - and I do mean a lot - of checking with every cab company in your area.
Unfortunately, for you, the cab company that took you home that night have got a computerised system.
They keep really good records.
Your journey details.
Times.
All paid up.
- No comment.
- Seriously?
My daughter was the same age as Pippa when this happened.
My heart went out to you.
I knew how you felt.
I couldn't let you down.
That's what I always thought.
Two years, never letting go - I nearly killed myself over this - and you're gonna "no comment" me?
So is there anything else you want to say to us?
I got my punishment that night.
What did you do with Lisa's body?
Lee was working at a church.
There was a funeral the day before, so best place to hide a body a grave.
Did you not find any traces of Rohypnol in Pippa's body?
Passes through the system in 24 hours.
We didn't find her for a few days.
Besides, the water had...
You did it.
You got them.
Done my penance.
I just keep thinking of all the damage done.
All those lives.
That's Beth.
She's here.
- Do you mind if I...
- No, go.
We're done.
Go on.
I think you're wrong, by the way.
You're wrong.
What you said to Lee in there.
We're not all alone.
I hope you're right, Miller.
- I wasn't sure you'd come.
- I can't believe you asked.
Anyway, I never miss a chance to be belittled.
- I want to work with you.
- You want to what?
I'm not ready to stop.
In fact, I'm just getting going again.
You don't want to end on a loss.
No, I bloody don't - and especially not to you.
Why would I ever want to work with you again?
Because I bring prestige, which matters...
Don't protest.
I'm brilliant.
I'd be your conscience...
challenge what you do - and I still think you need that.
I think you're wrong about the law...
and I understand why.
But it is a calling.
It...
It is noble.
And I think you need to get that back.
- I don't need a tutor.
- Yes, you do.
We all do.
It wouldn't work.
I'm sorry, but no.
I've done some work on this.
They're wrong about your son's case.
I think there could be grounds for appeal.
Where did you get these files?
They're the originals you sent me.
And you kept them, even though you don't like me very much?
I don't have to like you.
But I have to believe in you.
I've spent too much time here recently being afraid.
I need a way back in.
Get out.
- No!
No, not here!
- What's the matter, Joe?
You worried about what could happen up there?
Get out!
Mark, what are you gonna do to me?
Please don't.
No.
I trusted you.
Oh, God.
- Sit down.
- Beth...
Sit down!
Do you know how many knives there are in here?
14.
I counted them while I was waiting.
- Thought which'd be best to use on you.
- I'm sorry...
No, no, no.
Don't open your mouth.
You don't get to speak.
You could've kept one bit of your humanity.
You could've faced up to what you've done taken your punishment been a decent human being.
What...
What am I saying?
You're not that.
You can't ever have been.
When you die no-one will mourn for you.
We could kill you in here... dump your body on a beach...
No-one would care.
No-one would notice.
But we're more than you.
We will...
I will not be broken by this.
We all get to live.
But you you've no life left.
- Not here.
- I was found innocent...
Shut up!
Just shut up, you piece of shit!
- I'm sorry, Ell.
- You're not sorry!
If you were sorry, you'd have pleaded guilty.
You heard what she said.
You are leaving and you are never coming back.
And you will never see either of your children again.
- You can't do that.
- Oh, I can do that.
If you try and see them, if you follow them, if you go to their schools, if you contact them in any way, I will kill you.
And, unlike you, I will face the consequences.
You are dead to us.
Do you understand?
Now, you're coming with us.
Your bags are in the cab.
It'll take you to Bournemouth train station.
A vicar friend of mine will make sure you get on the train to Sheffield.
I've got you into a halfway house.
From there...you're on your own.
- You think you can banish me?
- We're sure of it, Joe.
What time's your taxi coming?
Erm...about half an hour.
- You don't have to wait.
- Right.
- Miller, I couldn't have done this without you.
- No, you couldn't.
And you didn't.
- Seriously.
- Don't be nice to me.
- That's not how it works.
- I...
So where are you gonna go?
Uh...
I don't know.
Erm...
Close to Daisy.
I need to be near my daughter.
Yeah.
Quite right.
Well...
OK, thanks for everything.
A handshake?
Yeah, not hugging you.
Look after yourself, Miller.
What about Joe?
It's been dealt with.
- I miss him so much.
- Me too.
We haven't shown you this place, have we?
And we can't never come here.
We can't miss out.
Not on somewhere this beautiful.
We lost your brother here, darlin'.
He would've loved you.
He would've loved having a little sister to boss around.
We have to reclaim it for you now, Lizzie.
And for us.
Keep our love as strong as steel.
That's the way we win.
- Heya.
- Hey!
You're late.
Yeah, but we've got crisps!
- Hello!
- Hello, Fred!
Yeah, he likes that, doesn't he?
He's a cutie, isn't he?
- Hello.
- How are you doing?
- All right.
- Hi, pretty girl.
- She's got a little red nose!
- Oh.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello!
- How you doing?
- All right.
Hello!
Are you saying hello to everybody?
Yeah.
Where to, then, sir?
Ripped By mstoll
' There were two girls.
Lisa Newbery, 19, was babysitting for her 12-year-old cousin, Pippa.
Pippa's parents went away for the night to a friend's wedding.
They came back the next day, and both the girls were gone.
Pippa, the 12 year old, she was found three days later.
Lisa...
Officially she's still missing.
Our main suspect was a man called Lee Ashworth, but he had a solid alibi.
Lee's my husband.
You have to be satisfied that you are sure of the defendant's guilt.
You are the judges of fact.
You must put aside any emotion and approach this in a cold, analytical way.
They're saying I might be the killer.
'You're saying Pippa's pendant belonged to Claire?
'
You took this?
You had this all along?
!
There's a verdict.
Jury are coming back in.
Have you reached a verdict on this defendant?
~ Yes.
~ Is this the verdict of you all, or as a majority?
A majority.
Will the defendant please stand?
Do you find the defendant, Joseph Michael Miller, guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
Mr Miller, you have been found not guilty.
You're free to leave the dock.
Thank you, My Lady.
Members of the jury, thank you for your careful attention to the facts and for delivering your verdict.
You have discharged your duties honourably.
This has been an...
This has been an extremely difficult and distressing case, and, as such, this court excuses you all from any future jury duty.
Thank you.
~ You OK?
~ Claire Ripley, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Pippa Gillespie and Lisa Newbery.
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.
Do you understand?
Right.
Go.
~ How is that justice?
~ It's not.
Go and be with your family.
I wanna kill him, El.
I know.
Me too.
Er, come with me.
Come on.
What does it take to destroy lives forever?
12 people.
12 ordinary, stupid, easily swayed, hard-of-thinking arseholes!
~ Alec, I'm so sorry!
~ I arrested this woman at 2:32 PM.
She's aware she's under caution.
Take her to the nick for me.
I rang the custody suite.
They know she's coming in.
I'll sit with you.
~ No, no.
I need Miller.
~ Yeah.
Course you do.
Claire just handed me this pendant.
You two should have plenty to talk about.
~ Are there any restrictions on where he can go?
~ Not now.
How do we get him back in court?
He killed Danny, and he's got off by playing the system.
You can't appeal once someone's been acquitted, unless compelling new evidence comes forward.
~ I don't believe this.
~ So, this is what happens.
~ Our lives get put through hell, and a guilty man walks free.
~ I'm sorry.
~ Where do you think Dad's gonna go?
~ Don't worry.
You'll be safe.
One of the uniformed lads will swing by Lucy's
~ in case he comes home.
~ Has he got keys to your place?
No.
I changed the locks months ago.
We'll get through this, OK?
It's gonna be all right, Mum.
How are the family taking it?
Maybe you should've asked that before you took on the case.
~ Oh, don't be a sore loser.
~ Then, don't be a shitty winner.
I trained you so much better than this.
All the people you could've helped, and you take on a child killer.
All I ever wanted was for you to prove me wrong
~ so that you could show the world how brilliant you - ~ No!
You wanted a mini-you.
You know the difference between us?
I don't see the nobility in this job.
I see a loaded, lopsided game, full of people justifying their cynicism as a higher calling.
It's street-fighting in wigs, that's all.
There are wins that help you sleep at night, others that keep you awake.
I'd stock up on the sleeping pills.
Right.
Miller, listen to me.
That anger you're feeling, that rage - that's exactly how I woke up every day for the past two years.
Don't you dare tell me to let it go!
Oh, God, no.
I want you to stoke it!
I want it to burn hard in you.
I need someone as angry as me right now, cos we're gonna close the case on Claire and Lee Ashworth today!
~ After what just happened, you think I'm gonna go with you?
~ I do.
You can't change this, but you can make sure another killer goes down.
That fury is fuel.
Do something with it.
The pendant is the lever to get them to confess.
We'll go in hard, work that verdict off on two very deserving people!
~ Yeah?
~ Claire's in custody.
We believe she has evidence relating to Lisa and Pippa's deaths.
~ "What evidence?" ~ I can't talk.
I'm just heading over there now.
Um, she turned down a solicitor.
She came to me, said she wanted us to know the truth now.
You haven't had a falling out, have you?
"Just do me a favour.
Don't leave the area."
I'm sure I'll want to talk to you very soon.
Are you ready?
~ It was Joe.
~ No!
God!
Time to stop playing games.
I need your help.
No.
I've been found innocent!
You have to help me come home.
Tell me how you came to have Pippa Gillespie's pendant, Claire.
~ Have you arrested Lee yet?
~ Is that what this is about?
You brought us the pendant as a way of sending a message to Lee?
Why did you tell my husband I was pregnant, or that I'd had an abortion, when I told you in confidence?
~ That's a breach of trust.
~ You wanna talk about trust?
How the Gillespies used to trust you to take their daughter to school?
What did you do on those journeys?
You start grooming her for Lee?
Why did you force me to have sex with you, Alec?
We have never had sex, Claire.
Why have you been holding me against my will?
~ Is there any truth to this?
~ Of course there bloody isn't!
You asked me to help you because you were worried
~ your husband would come after you.
~ You hurt me physically, Alec!
You were sad because your wife had another man's cock in her mouth, but you shouldn't have forced me to have sex with you!
~ Stop the interview.
~ Don't touch that.
~ I have to take these allegations - ~ Sit down, Miller!
You wanna keep going with these allegations?
Fill your boots!
We'll stop now.
You can report those offences.
I'll be arrested.
You want that?
We can do that.
Say the word.
That's not why you're here, is it?
You're here because of Lee.
So, what are you thinking?
We bring Lee in.
He gets a fright, seeing that.
And then, instead of betraying you... .. you're banking on him realising that he needs to stay close to you
~ because of what you know.
~ I don't know anything!
~ I don't!
~ You know what happened to Lisa Newbery and Pippa Gillespie.
You're wrong.
I don't think I am, not when I look in your eyes.
~ I'm not scared of you, Alec.
~ Yeah, well, you should be.
Why have you got Ricky Gillespie's office number in your mobile?
Oh, you're piping up now, are you?
Had a little peek at my phone?
Thank you for that, mate(!
)
Why would you be calling Pippa's dad?
Did Ricky send you the bluebell?
Oh, he did!
Why has Ricky got a picture of bluebells on his office wall?
Has he?
~ What happened that night, Claire?
~ Dunno.
~ You're kidding me!
~ Ssh, ssh, ssh!
He can't BE here!
He said it's the only place he can go.
No.
I mean he can't come back to this town.
~ And I've told him that.
~ So what did you call me for?
Because I need to tell someone else what I'm gonna do.
How are we meant to survive this?
I know what we have to do.
I just dunno how we do it.
What do you mean?
The system won't give us justice, then, we have to do it ourselves.
~ I'm gonna break her in there.
~ Listen to yourself.
You're too wound up!
Me?
!
You haven't met yourself!
I will do whatever it takes to get those two in prison.
~ Stop fiddling.
~ Something is bugging me.
What?
Oh, perfect.
Stay there.
OK.
I need someone to go to Lee and Claire's and get a photograph.
Talk to Tess.
I've got to do something.
~ Come on!
Where is it?
~ Where's what, Lee?
Before I called you, I had someone following you.
I'm arresting you in connection with the murders of Pippa Gillespie and Lisa Newbery.
Paul?
Paul?
Mark...
Agh!
Paul!
PAUL!
No!
Help!
Yeah, of course I'm happy.
I just wanna go home.
Yeah.
I-I've gotta go.
~ I bought gin.
~ Go away.
I can take a loss, but this one mattered.
Now the whole town knows I failed.
It hurts.
Yes.
Well, life does.
I never said being back in the world would be painless.
I want to make it right for them, Maggie, and I can't.
No.
None of us can now.
Do you think they'll be strong enough?
This what you after?
~ Wow, that was quick!
~ I'm really good.
Yes!
Look.
See, there it is.
That and that, which also makes sense of these two receipts.
Oh, Miller, that is outstanding!
So, I found this at the bottom of the old case files.
What's it for?
A stub for a job I was doing the following Monday.
~ Oak boards.
~ So you bought this Saturday morning, the exact amount, everything you needed?
Yeah.
And then I done the job on Monday.
Yeah, I know.
I checked.
So, why did you go back to the same supply yard first thing Monday and buy the exact same stuff again?
What?
A second, identical purchase.
Nobody thought to query it.
Obviously I'm a bit more fussy.
What happened to the stuff you bought on Saturday?
Why did you have to buy it again?
I didn't get enough.
This was taken a week before, as you were installing your own floor.
Those boards are not the same boards that are on that floor now.
'Those are dark-oak floorboards.
What's down there now is light oak.'
Same light-oak boards you bought Saturday morning, and again Monday.
What did you use those boards for, Lee, between Saturday and Monday?
What happened on the floor, Lee?
Nothing.
No.
Something did.
What were you looking for at the cottage, Lee?
~ Is this what you were looking for?
~ For the tape,
DI Hardy is showing Mr Ashworth a clear plastic evidence bag,
AH1, containing a pendant.
~ Where'd you get it from?
~ From your wife.
~ What?
~ This is the evidence that proves
Pippa Gillespie was in your car the night she died.
This is the missing evidence that nearly killed me... .. and now I've got it.
You know what I think this was?
Her insurance policy.
She didn't trust you... .. just like you never should've trusted her.
She has stitched you up.
And she never told you about the baby.
When you're in love, you think you're gonna be interlocked forever.
Love's all-encompassing when you're in it, but... really, you can't trust anyone.
Not even the people you love.
Ultimately... we're all alone.
You more than anyone right now.
So set the record straight, and we can all get released from this.
Come on.
You must be so tired of lying!
No-one's coming to your rescue.
This is it.
Last chance.
Did you kill Lisa Newbery?
Why won't he leave me alone?
~ Where's Pippa?
~ Asleep.
I should probably get back to her.
No.
Go get her.
Bring her over.
You can both stay here till he's gone.
~ I was just walking past.
~ Do you have to be such a wanker?
!
~ Oof!
Argh!
~ Get back to burning your animals!
~ Agh!
~ Oh, get off me!
Look at that!
You punched me!
Final warning.
Stay away from her.
But I love her.
Get over it, or I'll break your leg.
Go on.
Jog on!
~ You hit him!
~ Yeah, well, it's quicker than talking.
He did get a bit of a nosebleed, though, poor sod.
Well, you got blood on your shirt.
Yeah.
~ Where's Pippa?
~ She's asleep in your bed.
She barely woke up.
You had sex with Lisa Newbery that night?
All this time you've been denying it.
Then what?
You killed her?
No.
Claire.
You don't have a clue!
Ricky came home from the wedding?
~ Get your clothes on!
~ Calm down!
~ Where's Pippa?
~ She's upstairs!
~ I trusted you with her!
~ Lee was helping me.
~ Don't give me that!
~ I've been out there the last 15 minutes.
~ Watching us?
You bastard!
~ What you call me?
~ You're pissed.
Calm down.
I've seen you looking.
You're pissed off that I fucked him, not you!
~ Agh!
~ Is that how you talk to me?
~ Stop it!
~ No!
Get off me!
~ Call me a bastard again!
Where was Claire?
This little box contains Lee's taped evidence.
You are lying, Claire.
You've changed your story a dozen times, and blamed everyone but yourself.
Now it's time to tell the truth.
Lee's told us Ricky killed Lisa, but what happened to Pippa?
It's me.
You here?
Hey!
What you doing here, sweetheart?
~ What's wrong?
~ I think there's been an accident.
~ What do you mean?
~ Hey, hey, Pippa!
You should be asleep!
~ I thought you were at a wedding.
~ Is Lisa all right?
~ No, she's not.
~ She's, er...
I'm afraid Lee's really hurt her.
~ What?
What?
!
You should be in -
You didn't...
Claire, I need you to go to Pippa and sit with her.
I've told her you'll bring her medicine to calm her down.
Here.
Claire!
Give her some of that.
It'll help her sleep.
~ I'll deal with her in the morning.
~ Claire's not part of this.
~ Shut up.
You're all over her body.
You're inside her.
Her blood's on your floor.
I'll get the van.
You clean up in here.
You go to the police, and I'll put it all on you.
Claire, you can't give her that.
You can't give Pippa that.
When he goes out to bars, he puts Rohypnol in there.
~ We've got to go to the police.
~ Did you have sex with her?
Did you have sex with her, Lee?
What have you done?
!
Here you go.
How long were you sitting on the stairs, hm?
Come on.
It's all right.
I won't tell anyone.
I promise.
Had you been there long?
Yeah?
Was the door open?
But you heard something?
~ I heard Lisa and Lee.
~ Mm-hm?
They were having sex.
Then I heard the fight.
OK.
OK.
Thank you for telling me the truth, sweetheart.
Lee hurt Lisa, and Dad said...
It's all right.
It's all right.
Thank you for being honest.
You've done really well.
Now, I don't want you to worry.
You just need to rest.
Your dad has left you something.
Er, some medicine, just... .. calm you down, help you sleep.
We'll get all this sorted out.
I want you to take a big gulp of that.
A big gulp of that.
That's a good girl.
~ Well done.
~ I don't like it.
No.
It's horrible, isn't it?
Medicine always is.
But it's gonna help everything.
Snuggle down, now.
Come on.
Snuggle down.
Snug as a bug.
I'm just downstairs.
I'm worried about Lisa.
Everything's gonna be all right.
We've got to clear this mess up.
Pippa heard you having sex.
She thinks you killed Lisa.
Did you give her that stuff from the flask?
She'll be asleep now.
~ What are you doing?
Where's Pippa?
~ Look, I'll explain.
We haven't got much time.
Just drive.
Just drive!
~ Stay back from me.
~ Quiet!
What are we doing?
Where's Pippa?
~ Tell me where she is, now!
~ Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
~ Where is Pippa?
~ You need to stay calm, right?
~ I gave her some stuff from your flask, like you said.
~ Right.
What was in there?
That wasn't just whisky, was it?
~ What happened?
~ She had a reaction.
She couldn't breathe.
She was choking, and it was...
It was just so, so fast.
~ What are you telling me?
~ We couldn't call an ambulance Ricky, not with what you've done... .. to Lisa, with blood all over the floor!
We...couldn't save her.
She's gone.
No.
~ No!
~ I'm so sorry.
No.
You don't say that!
Lee said he knows somewhere peaceful, somewhere you used to go, where she won't be found for a while.
That's why we're here.
You can go and look.
I'll wait here.
I'll wait here.
Ricky!
Gimme the keys.
Listen.
I've got to tell you this.
I've buried your hip flask in the woods here.
I know exactly where, but nobody else will be able to find it.
If you feel like you wanna talk to the police, or you blame us, remember, I know where your hip flask is that contains traces that killed Pippa.
It's just a precaution.
That's all.
Nothing else.
You've thought it all through, haven't you?
I've got to think of the future.
I only came home that night to tell him I was pregnant.
We've got a pretty clear picture of the events of that night.
But we wanna hear it from you.
We know you killed Lisa.
~ But where did you bury her body?
~ No comment.
No, no, no, no.
Don't do that.
Cate broke your alibi weeks ago.
There were hours when she didn't see you at the wedding.
She assumed you were off sleeping with a bridesmaid, Tiffany Evans.
~ But Tiffany said otherwise.
~ And I did a lot of checking with every cab company in your area.
Unfortunately for you, the cab company that took you home have got a computerised system.
They keep really good records.
Your journey details, times, all paid up.
~ No comment.
~ Seriously?
My daughter was the same age as Pippa when this happened.
My heart went out to you.
I knew how you felt.
I couldn't let you down.
That's what I always thought.
Two years, never letting go!
I nearly killed myself over this, and you're gonna "no comment" me?
!
So, is there anything else you want to say to us?
I got my punishment that night.
What did you do with Lisa's body?
Lee was working at a church.
There was a funeral the day before.
So... .. best place to hide a body.
A grave.
Did you not find any traces of Rohypnol in Pippa's body?
Passes through the system in 24 hours.
We didn't find her for a few days.
And besides, they watered it down.
You did it.
You got them.
Done my penance.
I just keep thinking of all the damage done... .. all those lives.
~ That's Beth.
She's here.
Do you mind if I...
~ No, go.
Well done.
Go on.
I think you're wrong, by the way.
You're wrong, what you said to Lee in there.
We're not all alone.
Hope you're right about that.
~ I wasn't sure you'd come.
~ I can't believe you asked.
Anyway, I never miss a chance to be belittled.
~ I want to work with you.
~ You wanna what?
I'm not ready to stop.
In fact I'm just getting going again.
~ You don't want to end on a loss.
~ No, I bloody don't,
~ and especially not to you.
~ Why would I ever want to work with you again?
Because I bring prestige, which matters.
Don't protest!
I'm brilliant.
I'd be your conscience, challenge what you do, and I still think you need that.
I think you're wrong about the law.
I understand why, but it is a calling.
It is noble.
And I think... you need to get that back.
~ I don't need a tutor.
~ Yes, you do.
We all do.
It wouldn't work.
I'm sorry, but no.
I've done some work on this.
They're wrong about your son's case.
I think there could be grounds for appeal.
Where did you get these files?
They're the originals you sent me.
And you kept them, even though you don't like me very much.
I don't have to like you.
But I have to believe in you.
I've spent too much time here recently being afraid.
I need a way back in.
Get out.
~ No!
~ What's the matter?
You worried about what could happen?
Get out!
Mark, what are you gonna do to me?
Please, don't!
No!
I trusted you.
Oh, my God!
~ Sit down.
~ Where's...
Sit down!
Do you know how many knives there are in here?
14.
I counted 'em while I was waiting.
~ Thought which'd be best to use on you.
~ I'm sorry!
~ No, no, no.
Don't open your mouth.
You don't get to speak.
You could've kept... one bit of your humanity.
You could've faced up to what you've done... .. taken your punishment.
Been a decent human being.
What...
What am I saying?
You're not that.
You can't ever have been.
When you die... .. no-one will mourn for you.
We could kill you in here, dump your body on a beach.
And no-one'd care.
No-one'd notice.
But we're more than you.
We...
I will not be broken by this.
We all get to live.
But you... .. you've no life left.
Not here.
I was found innocent.
Shut up!
Just shut up, you piece of shit!
~ I'm sorry.
~ You're not sorry!
If you were sorry, you'd have pleaded guilty.
You heard what she said.
You are leaving.
You are never coming back.
And you will never see either of your children again.
~ You can't do that.
~ Oh, I can do that.
If you try and see them, if you follow them, if you go to their schools, if you contact them in any way,
I will kill you.
And unlike you, I will face the consequences.
You are dead to us.
Do you understand?
Now you're coming with us.
Up.
Your bags are in the cab.
It'll take you to Bournemouth train station.
A vicar friend of mine will meet you there and make sure you get on the train to Sheffield.
I've got you into a halfway house.
From there... .. you're on your own.
~ You think you can banish me?
~ We're sure of it, Joe.
~ What time's your taxi coming?
~ Um, about half an hour.
~ You don't have to wait.
~ Right.
~ I couldn't have done this without you.
~ No, you couldn't.
~ And you didn't.
~ Seriously.
~ Don't be nice to me.
It's not how it works.
~ All right.
So, where are you gonna go?
Er, I dunno.
Um...
Close to Daisy.
I need to be near my daughter.
Yeah.
Quite right.
Well...
OK.
Thanks for everything.
~ Handshake?
~ Yeah.
Not hugging you.
Look after yourself, Miller.
~ What about Joe?
~ Er, it's been dealt with.
I miss him so much.
Me too.
We haven't shown you this place, have we?
We can't never come here.
We can't... miss out.
Not on somewhere this beautiful.
We lost your brother here, darlin'.
He would've loved you.
Would've loved having a little sister to boss around.
I have to reclaim it for you now, Lizzie.
And for us.
Keep our love as strong as steel.
That's the way we win.
~ Yeah.
~ Hey!
You're late!
Yeah, but we've got crisps!
~ Hello!
~ Hello, Fred!
Yeah, he likes that, don't he?
~ He's a cutie, ain't he?
~ Hello.
~ How you doing?
~ All right.
~ Hey, pretty girl!
~ She's got a little red nose.
~ Oh, you have!
~ Hello.
How you doing?
~ All right.
~ Hello.
~ Have you said hello to everybody?
Yeah!
Where to, then, sir?
' There were two girls.
Lisa Newbery, 19, was babysitting for her 12-year-old cousin, Pippa.
Pippa's parents went away for the night to a friend's wedding.
They came back the next day, and both the girls were gone.
Pippa, the 12 year old, she was found three days later.
Lisa...
Officially she's still missing.
Our main suspect was a man called Lee Ashworth, but he had a solid alibi.
Lee's my husband.
You have to be satisfied that you are sure of the defendant's guilt.
You are the judges of fact.
You must put aside any emotion and approach this in a cold, analytical way.
They're saying I might be the killer.
'You're saying Pippa's pendant belonged to Claire?
'
You took this?
You had this all along?
!
There's a verdict.
Jury are coming back in.
Have you reached a verdict on this defendant?
~ Yes.
~ Is this the verdict of you all, or as a majority?
A majority.
Will the defendant please stand?
Do you find the defendant, Joseph Michael Miller, guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
Mr Miller, you have been found not guilty.
You're free to leave the dock.
Thank you, My Lady.
Members of the jury, thank you for your careful attention to the facts and for delivering your verdict.
You have discharged your duties honourably.
This has been an...
This has been an extremely difficult and distressing case, and, as such, this court excuses you all from any future jury duty.
Thank you.
~ You OK?
~ Claire Ripley, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Pippa Gillespie and Lisa Newbery.
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.
Do you understand?
Right.
Go.
~ How is that justice?
~ It's not.
Go and be with your family.
I wanna kill him, El.
I know.
Me too.
Er, come with me.
Come on.
What does it take to destroy lives forever?
12 people.
12 ordinary, stupid, easily swayed, hard-of-thinking arseholes!
~ Alec, I'm so sorry!
~ I arrested this woman at 2:32 PM.
She's aware she's under caution.
Take her to the nick for me.
I rang the custody suite.
They know she's coming in.
I'll sit with you.
~ No, no.
I need Miller.
~ Yeah.
Course you do.
Claire just handed me this pendant.
You two should have plenty to talk about.
~ Are there any restrictions on where he can go?
~ Not now.
How do we get him back in court?
He killed Danny, and he's got off by playing the system.
You can't appeal once someone's been acquitted, unless compelling new evidence comes forward.
~ I don't believe this.
~ So, this is what happens.
~ Our lives get put through hell, and a guilty man walks free.
~ I'm sorry.
~ Where do you think Dad's gonna go?
~ Don't worry.
You'll be safe.
One of the uniformed lads will swing by Lucy's
~ in case he comes home.
~ Has he got keys to your place?
No.
I changed the locks months ago.
We'll get through this, OK?
It's gonna be all right, Mum.
How are the family taking it?
Maybe you should've asked that before you took on the case.
~ Oh, don't be a sore loser.
~ Then, don't be a shitty winner.
I trained you so much better than this.
All the people you could've helped, and you take on a child killer.
All I ever wanted was for you to prove me wrong
~ so that you could show the world how brilliant you - ~ No!
You wanted a mini-you.
You know the difference between us?
I don't see the nobility in this job.
I see a loaded, lopsided game, full of people justifying their cynicism as a higher calling.
It's street-fighting in wigs, that's all.
There are wins that help you sleep at night, others that keep you awake.
I'd stock up on the sleeping pills.
Right.
Miller, listen to me.
That anger you're feeling, that rage - that's exactly how I woke up every day for the past two years.
Don't you dare tell me to let it go!
Oh, God, no.
I want you to stoke it!
I want it to burn hard in you.
I need someone as angry as me right now, cos we're gonna close the case on Claire and Lee Ashworth today!
~ After what just happened, you think I'm gonna go with you?
~ I do.
You can't change this, but you can make sure another killer goes down.
That fury is fuel.
Do something with it.
The pendant is the lever to get them to confess.
We'll go in hard, work that verdict off on two very deserving people!
~ Yeah?
~ Claire's in custody.
We believe she has evidence relating to Lisa and Pippa's deaths.
~ "What evidence?" ~ I can't talk.
I'm just heading over there now.
Um, she turned down a solicitor.
She came to me, said she wanted us to know the truth now.
You haven't had a falling out, have you?
"Just do me a favour.
Don't leave the area."
I'm sure I'll want to talk to you very soon.
Are you ready?
~ It was Joe.
~ No!
God!
Time to stop playing games.
I need your help.
No.
I've been found innocent!
You have to help me come home.
Tell me how you came to have Pippa Gillespie's pendant, Claire.
~ Have you arrested Lee yet?
~ Is that what this is about?
You brought us the pendant as a way of sending a message to Lee?
Why did you tell my husband I was pregnant, or that I'd had an abortion, when I told you in confidence?
~ That's a breach of trust.
~ You wanna talk about trust?
How the Gillespies used to trust you to take their daughter to school?
What did you do on those journeys?
You start grooming her for Lee?
Why did you force me to have sex with you, Alec?
We have never had sex, Claire.
Why have you been holding me against my will?
~ Is there any truth to this?
~ Of course there bloody isn't!
You asked me to help you because you were worried
~ your husband would come after you.
~ You hurt me physically, Alec!
You were sad because your wife had another man's cock in her mouth, but you shouldn't have forced me to have sex with you!
~ Stop the interview.
~ Don't touch that.
~ I have to take these allegations - ~ Sit down, Miller!
You wanna keep going with these allegations?
Fill your boots!
We'll stop now.
You can report those offences.
I'll be arrested.
You want that?
We can do that.
Say the word.
That's not why you're here, is it?
You're here because of Lee.
So, what are you thinking?
We bring Lee in.
He gets a fright, seeing that.
And then, instead of betraying you... .. you're banking on him realising that he needs to stay close to you
~ because of what you know.
~ I don't know anything!
~ I don't!
~ You know what happened to Lisa Newbery and Pippa Gillespie.
You're wrong.
I don't think I am, not when I look in your eyes.
~ I'm not scared of you, Alec.
~ Yeah, well, you should be.
Why have you got Ricky Gillespie's office number in your mobile?
Oh, you're piping up now, are you?
Had a little peek at my phone?
Thank you for that, mate(!
)
Why would you be calling Pippa's dad?
Did Ricky send you the bluebell?
Oh, he did!
Why has Ricky got a picture of bluebells on his office wall?
Has he?
~ What happened that night, Claire?
~ Dunno.
~ You're kidding me!
~ Ssh, ssh, ssh!
He can't BE here!
He said it's the only place he can go.
No.
I mean he can't come back to this town.
~ And I've told him that.
~ So what did you call me for?
Because I need to tell someone else what I'm gonna do.
How are we meant to survive this?
I know what we have to do.
I just dunno how we do it.
What do you mean?
The system won't give us justice, then, we have to do it ourselves.
~ I'm gonna break her in there.
~ Listen to yourself.
You're too wound up!
Me?
!
You haven't met yourself!
I will do whatever it takes to get those two in prison.
~ Stop fiddling.
~ Something is bugging me.
What?
Oh, perfect.
Stay there.
OK.
I need someone to go to Lee and Claire's and get a photograph.
Talk to Tess.
I've got to do something.
~ Come on!
Where is it?
~ Where's what, Lee?
Before I called you, I had someone following you.
I'm arresting you in connection with the murders of Pippa Gillespie and Lisa Newbery.
Paul?
Paul?
Mark...
Agh!
Paul!
PAUL!
No!
Help!
Yeah, of course I'm happy.
I just wanna go home.
Yeah.
I-I've gotta go.
~ I bought gin.
~ Go away.
I can take a loss, but this one mattered.
Now the whole town knows I failed.
It hurts.
Yes.
Well, life does.
I never said being back in the world would be painless.
I want to make it right for them, Maggie, and I can't.
No.
None of us can now.
Do you think they'll be strong enough?
This what you after?
~ Wow, that was quick!
~ I'm really good.
Yes!
Look.
See, there it is.
That and that, which also makes sense of these two receipts.
Oh, Miller, that is outstanding!
So, I found this at the bottom of the old case files.
What's it for?
A stub for a job I was doing the following Monday.
~ Oak boards.
~ So you bought this Saturday morning, the exact amount, everything you needed?
Yeah.
And then I done the job on Monday.
Yeah, I know.
I checked.
So, why did you go back to the same supply yard first thing Monday and buy the exact same stuff again?
What?
A second, identical purchase.
Nobody thought to query it.
Obviously I'm a bit more fussy.
What happened to the stuff you bought on Saturday?
Why did you have to buy it again?
I didn't get enough.
This was taken a week before, as you were installing your own floor.
Those boards are not the same boards that are on that floor now.
'Those are dark-oak floorboards.
What's down there now is light oak.'
Same light-oak boards you bought Saturday morning, and again Monday.
What did you use those boards for, Lee, between Saturday and Monday?
What happened on the floor, Lee?
Nothing.
No.
Something did.
What were you looking for at the cottage, Lee?
~ Is this what you were looking for?
~ For the tape,
DI Hardy is showing Mr Ashworth a clear plastic evidence bag,
AH1, containing a pendant.
~ Where'd you get it from?
~ From your wife.
~ What?
~ This is the evidence that proves
Pippa Gillespie was in your car the night she died.
This is the missing evidence that nearly killed me... .. and now I've got it.
You know what I think this was?
Her insurance policy.
She didn't trust you... .. just like you never should've trusted her.
She has stitched you up.
And she never told you about the baby.
When you're in love, you think you're gonna be interlocked forever.
Love's all-encompassing when you're in it, but... really, you can't trust anyone.
Not even the people you love.
Ultimately... we're all alone.
You more than anyone right now.
So set the record straight, and we can all get released from this.
Come on.
You must be so tired of lying!
No-one's coming to your rescue.
This is it.
Last chance.
Did you kill Lisa Newbery?
Why won't he leave me alone?
~ Where's Pippa?
~ Asleep.
I should probably get back to her.
No.
Go get her.
Bring her over.
You can both stay here till he's gone.
~ I was just walking past.
~ Do you have to be such a wanker?
!
~ Oof!
Argh!
~ Get back to burning your animals!
~ Agh!
~ Oh, get off me!
Look at that!
You punched me!
Final warning.
Stay away from her.
But I love her.
Get over it, or I'll break your leg.
Go on.
Jog on!
~ You hit him!
~ Yeah, well, it's quicker than talking.
He did get a bit of a nosebleed, though, poor sod.
Well, you got blood on your shirt.
Yeah.
~ Where's Pippa?
~ She's asleep in your bed.
She barely woke up.
You had sex with Lisa Newbery that night?
All this time you've been denying it.
Then what?
You killed her?
No.
Claire.
You don't have a clue!
Ricky came home from the wedding?
~ Get your clothes on!
~ Calm down!
~ Where's Pippa?
~ She's upstairs!
~ I trusted you with her!
~ Lee was helping me.
~ Don't give me that!
~ I've been out there the last 15 minutes.
~ Watching us?
You bastard!
~ What you call me?
~ You're pissed.
Calm down.
I've seen you looking.
You're pissed off that I fucked him, not you!
~ Agh!
~ Is that how you talk to me?
~ Stop it!
~ No!
Get off me!
~ Call me a bastard again!
Where was Claire?
This little box contains Lee's taped evidence.
You are lying, Claire.
You've changed your story a dozen times, and blamed everyone but yourself.
Now it's time to tell the truth.
Lee's told us Ricky killed Lisa, but what happened to Pippa?
It's me.
You here?
Hey!
What you doing here, sweetheart?
~ What's wrong?
~ I think there's been an accident.
~ What do you mean?
~ Hey, hey, Pippa!
You should be asleep!
~ I thought you were at a wedding.
~ Is Lisa all right?
~ No, she's not.
~ She's, er...
I'm afraid Lee's really hurt her.
~ What?
What?
!
You should be in -
You didn't...
Claire, I need you to go to Pippa and sit with her.
I've told her you'll bring her medicine to calm her down.
Here.
Claire!
Give her some of that.
It'll help her sleep.
~ I'll deal with her in the morning.
~ Claire's not part of this.
~ Shut up.
You're all over her body.
You're inside her.
Her blood's on your floor.
I'll get the van.
You clean up in here.
You go to the police, and I'll put it all on you.
Claire, you can't give her that.
You can't give Pippa that.
When he goes out to bars, he puts Rohypnol in there.
~ We've got to go to the police.
~ Did you have sex with her?
Did you have sex with her, Lee?
What have you done?
!
Here you go.
How long were you sitting on the stairs, hm?
Come on.
It's all right.
I won't tell anyone.
I promise.
Had you been there long?
Yeah?
Was the door open?
But you heard something?
~ I heard Lisa and Lee.
~ Mm-hm?
They were having sex.
Then I heard the fight.
OK.
OK.
Thank you for telling me the truth, sweetheart.
Lee hurt Lisa, and Dad said...
It's all right.
It's all right.
Thank you for being honest.
You've done really well.
Now, I don't want you to worry.
You just need to rest.
Your dad has left you something.
Er, some medicine, just... .. calm you down, help you sleep.
We'll get all this sorted out.
I want you to take a big gulp of that.
A big gulp of that.
That's a good girl.
~ Well done.
~ I don't like it.
No.
It's horrible, isn't it?
Medicine always is.
But it's gonna help everything.
Snuggle down, now.
Come on.
Snuggle down.
Snug as a bug.
I'm just downstairs.
I'm worried about Lisa.
Everything's gonna be all right.
We've got to clear this mess up.
Pippa heard you having sex.
She thinks you killed Lisa.
Did you give her that stuff from the flask?
She'll be asleep now.
~ What are you doing?
Where's Pippa?
~ Look, I'll explain.
We haven't got much time.
Just drive.
Just drive!
~ Stay back from me.
~ Quiet!
What are we doing?
Where's Pippa?
~ Tell me where she is, now!
~ Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
~ Where is Pippa?
~ You need to stay calm, right?
~ I gave her some stuff from your flask, like you said.
~ Right.
What was in there?
That wasn't just whisky, was it?
~ What happened?
~ She had a reaction.
She couldn't breathe.
She was choking, and it was...
It was just so, so fast.
~ What are you telling me?
~ We couldn't call an ambulance Ricky, not with what you've done... .. to Lisa, with blood all over the floor!
We...couldn't save her.
She's gone.
No.
~ No!
~ I'm so sorry.
No.
You don't say that!
Lee said he knows somewhere peaceful, somewhere you used to go, where she won't be found for a while.
That's why we're here.
You can go and look.
I'll wait here.
I'll wait here.
Ricky!
Gimme the keys.
Listen.
I've got to tell you this.
I've buried your hip flask in the woods here.
I know exactly where, but nobody else will be able to find it.
If you feel like you wanna talk to the police, or you blame us, remember, I know where your hip flask is that contains traces that killed Pippa.
It's just a precaution.
That's all.
Nothing else.
You've thought it all through, haven't you?
I've got to think of the future.
I only came home that night to tell him I was pregnant.
We've got a pretty clear picture of the events of that night.
But we wanna hear it from you.
We know you killed Lisa.
~ But where did you bury her body?
~ No comment.
No, no, no, no.
Don't do that.
Cate broke your alibi weeks ago.
There were hours when she didn't see you at the wedding.
She assumed you were off sleeping with a bridesmaid, Tiffany Evans.
~ But Tiffany said otherwise.
~ And I did a lot of checking with every cab company in your area.
Unfortunately for you, the cab company that took you home have got a computerised system.
They keep really good records.
Your journey details, times, all paid up.
~ No comment.
~ Seriously?
My daughter was the same age as Pippa when this happened.
My heart went out to you.
I knew how you felt.
I couldn't let you down.
That's what I always thought.
Two years, never letting go!
I nearly killed myself over this, and you're gonna "no comment" me?
!
So, is there anything else you want to say to us?
I got my punishment that night.
What did you do with Lisa's body?
Lee was working at a church.
There was a funeral the day before.
So... .. best place to hide a body.
A grave.
Did you not find any traces of Rohypnol in Pippa's body?
Passes through the system in 24 hours.
We didn't find her for a few days.
And besides, they watered it down.
You did it.
You got them.
Done my penance.
I just keep thinking of all the damage done... .. all those lives.
~ That's Beth.
She's here.
Do you mind if I...
~ No, go.
Well done.
Go on.
I think you're wrong, by the way.
You're wrong, what you said to Lee in there.
We're not all alone.
Hope you're right about that.
~ I wasn't sure you'd come.
~ I can't believe you asked.
Anyway, I never miss a chance to be belittled.
~ I want to work with you.
~ You wanna what?
I'm not ready to stop.
In fact I'm just getting going again.
~ You don't want to end on a loss.
~ No, I bloody don't,
~ and especially not to you.
~ Why would I ever want to work with you again?
Because I bring prestige, which matters.
Don't protest!
I'm brilliant.
I'd be your conscience, challenge what you do, and I still think you need that.
I think you're wrong about the law.
I understand why, but it is a calling.
It is noble.
And I think... you need to get that back.
~ I don't need a tutor.
~ Yes, you do.
We all do.
It wouldn't work.
I'm sorry, but no.
I've done some work on this.
They're wrong about your son's case.
I think there could be grounds for appeal.
Where did you get these files?
They're the originals you sent me.
And you kept them, even though you don't like me very much.
I don't have to like you.
But I have to believe in you.
I've spent too much time here recently being afraid.
I need a way back in.
Get out.
~ No!
~ What's the matter?
You worried about what could happen?
Get out!
Mark, what are you gonna do to me?
Please, don't!
No!
I trusted you.
Oh, my God!
~ Sit down.
~ Where's...
Sit down!
Do you know how many knives there are in here?
14.
I counted 'em while I was waiting.
~ Thought which'd be best to use on you.
~ I'm sorry!
~ No, no, no.
Don't open your mouth.
You don't get to speak.
You could've kept... one bit of your humanity.
You could've faced up to what you've done... .. taken your punishment.
Been a decent human being.
What...
What am I saying?
You're not that.
You can't ever have been.
When you die... .. no-one will mourn for you.
We could kill you in here, dump your body on a beach.
And no-one'd care.
No-one'd notice.
But we're more than you.
We...
I will not be broken by this.
We all get to live.
But you... .. you've no life left.
Not here.
I was found innocent.
Shut up!
Just shut up, you piece of shit!
~ I'm sorry.
~ You're not sorry!
If you were sorry, you'd have pleaded guilty.
You heard what she said.
You are leaving.
You are never coming back.
And you will never see either of your children again.
~ You can't do that.
~ Oh, I can do that.
If you try and see them, if you follow them, if you go to their schools, if you contact them in any way,
I will kill you.
And unlike you, I will face the consequences.
You are dead to us.
Do you understand?
Now you're coming with us.
Up.
Your bags are in the cab.
It'll take you to Bournemouth train station.
A vicar friend of mine will meet you there and make sure you get on the train to Sheffield.
I've got you into a halfway house.
From there... .. you're on your own.
~ You think you can banish me?
~ We're sure of it, Joe.
~ What time's your taxi coming?
~ Um, about half an hour.
~ You don't have to wait.
~ Right.
~ I couldn't have done this without you.
~ No, you couldn't.
~ And you didn't.
~ Seriously.
~ Don't be nice to me.
It's not how it works.
~ All right.
So, where are you gonna go?
Er, I dunno.
Um...
Close to Daisy.
I need to be near my daughter.
Yeah.
Quite right.
Well...
OK.
Thanks for everything.
~ Handshake?
~ Yeah.
Not hugging you.
Look after yourself, Miller.
~ What about Joe?
~ Er, it's been dealt with.
I miss him so much.
Me too.
We haven't shown you this place, have we?
We can't never come here.
We can't... miss out.
Not on somewhere this beautiful.
We lost your brother here, darlin'.
He would've loved you.
Would've loved having a little sister to boss around.
I have to reclaim it for you now, Lizzie.
And for us.
Keep our love as strong as steel.
That's the way we win.
~ Yeah.
~ Hey!
You're late!
Yeah, but we've got crisps!
~ Hello!
~ Hello, Fred!
Yeah, he likes that, don't he?
~ He's a cutie, ain't he?
~ Hello.
~ How you doing?
~ All right.
~ Hey, pretty girl!
~ She's got a little red nose.
~ Oh, you have!
~ Hello.
How you doing?
~ All right.
~ Hello.
~ Have you said hello to everybody?
Yeah!
Where to, then, sir?
' There were two girls.
Lisa Newbery, 19, was babysitting for her 12-year-old cousin, Pippa.
Pippa's parents went away for the night to a friend's wedding.
They came back the next day, and both the girls were gone.
Pippa, the 12 year old, she was found three days later.
Lisa...
Officially she's still missing.
Our main suspect was a man called Lee Ashworth, but he had a solid alibi.
Lee's my husband.
You have to be satisfied that you are sure of the defendant's guilt.
You are the judges of fact.
You must put aside any emotion and approach this in a cold, analytical way.
They're saying I might be the killer.
'You're saying Pippa's pendant belonged to Claire?
'
You took this?
You had this all along?
!
There's a verdict.
Jury are coming back in.
Have you reached a verdict on this defendant?
~ Yes.
~ Is this the verdict of you all, or as a majority?
A majority.
Will the defendant please stand?
Do you find the defendant, Joseph Michael Miller, guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
Mr Miller, you have been found not guilty.
You're free to leave the dock.
Thank you, My Lady.
Members of the jury, thank you for your careful attention to the facts and for delivering your verdict.
You have discharged your duties honourably.
This has been an...
This has been an extremely difficult and distressing case, and, as such, this court excuses you all from any future jury duty.
Thank you.
~ You OK?
~ Claire Ripley, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Pippa Gillespie and Lisa Newbery.
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.
Do you understand?
Right.
Go.
~ How is that justice?
~ It's not.
Go and be with your family.
I wanna kill him, El.
I know.
Me too.
Er, come with me.
Come on.
What does it take to destroy lives forever?
12 people.
12 ordinary, stupid, easily swayed, hard-of-thinking arseholes!
~ Alec, I'm so sorry!
~ I arrested this woman at 2:32 PM.
She's aware she's under caution.
Take her to the nick for me.
I rang the custody suite.
They know she's coming in.
I'll sit with you.
~ No, no.
I need Miller.
~ Yeah.
Course you do.
Claire just handed me this pendant.
You two should have plenty to talk about.
~ Are there any restrictions on where he can go?
~ Not now.
How do we get him back in court?
He killed Danny, and he's got off by playing the system.
You can't appeal once someone's been acquitted, unless compelling new evidence comes forward.
~ I don't believe this.
~ So, this is what happens.
~ Our lives get put through hell, and a guilty man walks free.
~ I'm sorry.
~ Where do you think Dad's gonna go?
~ Don't worry.
You'll be safe.
One of the uniformed lads will swing by Lucy's
~ in case he comes home.
~ Has he got keys to your place?
No.
I changed the locks months ago.
We'll get through this, OK?
It's gonna be all right, Mum.
How are the family taking it?
Maybe you should've asked that before you took on the case.
~ Oh, don't be a sore loser.
~ Then, don't be a shitty winner.
I trained you so much better than this.
All the people you could've helped, and you take on a child killer.
All I ever wanted was for you to prove me wrong
~ so that you could show the world how brilliant you - ~ No!
You wanted a mini-you.
You know the difference between us?
I don't see the nobility in this job.
I see a loaded, lopsided game, full of people justifying their cynicism as a higher calling.
It's street-fighting in wigs, that's all.
There are wins that help you sleep at night, others that keep you awake.
I'd stock up on the sleeping pills.
Right.
Miller, listen to me.
That anger you're feeling, that rage - that's exactly how I woke up every day for the past two years.
Don't you dare tell me to let it go!
Oh, God, no.
I want you to stoke it!
I want it to burn hard in you.
I need someone as angry as me right now, cos we're gonna close the case on Claire and Lee Ashworth today!
~ After what just happened, you think I'm gonna go with you?
~ I do.
You can't change this, but you can make sure another killer goes down.
That fury is fuel.
Do something with it.
The pendant is the lever to get them to confess.
We'll go in hard, work that verdict off on two very deserving people!
~ Yeah?
~ Claire's in custody.
We believe she has evidence relating to Lisa and Pippa's deaths.
~ "What evidence?" ~ I can't talk.
I'm just heading over there now.
Um, she turned down a solicitor.
She came to me, said she wanted us to know the truth now.
You haven't had a falling out, have you?
"Just do me a favour.
Don't leave the area."
I'm sure I'll want to talk to you very soon.
Are you ready?
~ It was Joe.
~ No!
God!
Time to stop playing games.
I need your help.
No.
I've been found innocent!
You have to help me come home.
Tell me how you came to have Pippa Gillespie's pendant, Claire.
~ Have you arrested Lee yet?
~ Is that what this is about?
You brought us the pendant as a way of sending a message to Lee?
Why did you tell my husband I was pregnant, or that I'd had an abortion, when I told you in confidence?
~ That's a breach of trust.
~ You wanna talk about trust?
How the Gillespies used to trust you to take their daughter to school?
What did you do on those journeys?
You start grooming her for Lee?
Why did you force me to have sex with you, Alec?
We have never had sex, Claire.
Why have you been holding me against my will?
~ Is there any truth to this?
~ Of course there bloody isn't!
You asked me to help you because you were worried
~ your husband would come after you.
~ You hurt me physically, Alec!
You were sad because your wife had another man's cock in her mouth, but you shouldn't have forced me to have sex with you!
~ Stop the interview.
~ Don't touch that.
~ I have to take these allegations - ~ Sit down, Miller!
You wanna keep going with these allegations?
Fill your boots!
We'll stop now.
You can report those offences.
I'll be arrested.
You want that?
We can do that.
Say the word.
That's not why you're here, is it?
You're here because of Lee.
So, what are you thinking?
We bring Lee in.
He gets a fright, seeing that.
And then, instead of betraying you... .. you're banking on him realising that he needs to stay close to you
~ because of what you know.
~ I don't know anything!
~ I don't!
~ You know what happened to Lisa Newbery and Pippa Gillespie.
You're wrong.
I don't think I am, not when I look in your eyes.
~ I'm not scared of you, Alec.
~ Yeah, well, you should be.
Why have you got Ricky Gillespie's office number in your mobile?
Oh, you're piping up now, are you?
Had a little peek at my phone?
Thank you for that, mate(!
)
Why would you be calling Pippa's dad?
Did Ricky send you the bluebell?
Oh, he did!
Why has Ricky got a picture of bluebells on his office wall?
Has he?
~ What happened that night, Claire?
~ Dunno.
~ You're kidding me!
~ Ssh, ssh, ssh!
He can't BE here!
He said it's the only place he can go.
No.
I mean he can't come back to this town.
~ And I've told him that.
~ So what did you call me for?
Because I need to tell someone else what I'm gonna do.
How are we meant to survive this?
I know what we have to do.
I just dunno how we do it.
What do you mean?
The system won't give us justice, then, we have to do it ourselves.
~ I'm gonna break her in there.
~ Listen to yourself.
You're too wound up!
Me?
!
You haven't met yourself!
I will do whatever it takes to get those two in prison.
~ Stop fiddling.
~ Something is bugging me.
What?
Oh, perfect.
Stay there.
OK.
I need someone to go to Lee and Claire's and get a photograph.
Talk to Tess.
I've got to do something.
~ Come on!
Where is it?
~ Where's what, Lee?
Before I called you, I had someone following you.
I'm arresting you in connection with the murders of Pippa Gillespie and Lisa Newbery.
Paul?
Paul?
Mark...
Agh!
Paul!
PAUL!
No!
Help!
Yeah, of course I'm happy.
I just wanna go home.
Yeah.
I-I've gotta go.
~ I bought gin.
~ Go away.
I can take a loss, but this one mattered.
Now the whole town knows I failed.
It hurts.
Yes.
Well, life does.
I never said being back in the world would be painless.
I want to make it right for them, Maggie, and I can't.
No.
None of us can now.
Do you think they'll be strong enough?
This what you after?
~ Wow, that was quick!
~ I'm really good.
Yes!
Look.
See, there it is.
That and that, which also makes sense of these two receipts.
Oh, Miller, that is outstanding!
So, I found this at the bottom of the old case files.
What's it for?
A stub for a job I was doing the following Monday.
~ Oak boards.
~ So you bought this Saturday morning, the exact amount, everything you needed?
Yeah.
And then I done the job on Monday.
Yeah, I know.
I checked.
So, why did you go back to the same supply yard first thing Monday and buy the exact same stuff again?
What?
A second, identical purchase.
Nobody thought to query it.
Obviously I'm a bit more fussy.
What happened to the stuff you bought on Saturday?
Why did you have to buy it again?
I didn't get enough.
This was taken a week before, as you were installing your own floor.
Those boards are not the same boards that are on that floor now.
'Those are dark-oak floorboards.
What's down there now is light oak.'
Same light-oak boards you bought Saturday morning, and again Monday.
What did you use those boards for, Lee, between Saturday and Monday?
What happened on the floor, Lee?
Nothing.
No.
Something did.
What were you looking for at the cottage, Lee?
~ Is this what you were looking for?
~ For the tape,
DI Hardy is showing Mr Ashworth a clear plastic evidence bag,
AH1, containing a pendant.
~ Where'd you get it from?
~ From your wife.
~ What?
~ This is the evidence that proves
Pippa Gillespie was in your car the night she died.
This is the missing evidence that nearly killed me... .. and now I've got it.
You know what I think this was?
Her insurance policy.
She didn't trust you... .. just like you never should've trusted her.
She has stitched you up.
And she never told you about the baby.
When you're in love, you think you're gonna be interlocked forever.
Love's all-encompassing when you're in it, but... really, you can't trust anyone.
Not even the people you love.
Ultimately... we're all alone.
You more than anyone right now.
So set the record straight, and we can all get released from this.
Come on.
You must be so tired of lying!
No-one's coming to your rescue.
This is it.
Last chance.
Did you kill Lisa Newbery?
Why won't he leave me alone?
~ Where's Pippa?
~ Asleep.
I should probably get back to her.
No.
Go get her.
Bring her over.
You can both stay here till he's gone.
~ I was just walking past.
~ Do you have to be such a wanker?
!
~ Oof!
Argh!
~ Get back to burning your animals!
~ Agh!
~ Oh, get off me!
Look at that!
You punched me!
Final warning.
Stay away from her.
But I love her.
Get over it, or I'll break your leg.
Go on.
Jog on!
~ You hit him!
~ Yeah, well, it's quicker than talking.
He did get a bit of a nosebleed, though, poor sod.
Well, you got blood on your shirt.
Yeah.
~ Where's Pippa?
~ She's asleep in your bed.
She barely woke up.
You had sex with Lisa Newbery that night?
All this time you've been denying it.
Then what?
You killed her?
No.
Claire.
You don't have a clue!
Ricky came home from the wedding?
~ Get your clothes on!
~ Calm down!
~ Where's Pippa?
~ She's upstairs!
~ I trusted you with her!
~ Lee was helping me.
~ Don't give me that!
~ I've been out there the last 15 minutes.
~ Watching us?
You bastard!
~ What you call me?
~ You're pissed.
Calm down.
I've seen you looking.
You're pissed off that I fucked him, not you!
~ Agh!
~ Is that how you talk to me?
~ Stop it!
~ No!
Get off me!
~ Call me a bastard again!
Where was Claire?
This little box contains Lee's taped evidence.
You are lying, Claire.
You've changed your story a dozen times, and blamed everyone but yourself.
Now it's time to tell the truth.
Lee's told us Ricky killed Lisa, but what happened to Pippa?
It's me.
You here?
Hey!
What you doing here, sweetheart?
~ What's wrong?
~ I think there's been an accident.
~ What do you mean?
~ Hey, hey, Pippa!
You should be asleep!
~ I thought you were at a wedding.
~ Is Lisa all right?
~ No, she's not.
~ She's, er...
I'm afraid Lee's really hurt her.
~ What?
What?
!
You should be in -
You didn't...
Claire, I need you to go to Pippa and sit with her.
I've told her you'll bring her medicine to calm her down.
Here.
Claire!
Give her some of that.
It'll help her sleep.
~ I'll deal with her in the morning.
~ Claire's not part of this.
~ Shut up.
You're all over her body.
You're inside her.
Her blood's on your floor.
I'll get the van.
You clean up in here.
You go to the police, and I'll put it all on you.
Claire, you can't give her that.
You can't give Pippa that.
When he goes out to bars, he puts Rohypnol in there.
~ We've got to go to the police.
~ Did you have sex with her?
Did you have sex with her, Lee?
What have you done?
!
Here you go.
How long were you sitting on the stairs, hm?
Come on.
It's all right.
I won't tell anyone.
I promise.
Had you been there long?
Yeah?
Was the door open?
But you heard something?
~ I heard Lisa and Lee.
~ Mm-hm?
They were having sex.
Then I heard the fight.
OK.
OK.
Thank you for telling me the truth, sweetheart.
Lee hurt Lisa, and Dad said...
It's all right.
It's all right.
Thank you for being honest.
You've done really well.
Now, I don't want you to worry.
You just need to rest.
Your dad has left you something.
Er, some medicine, just... .. calm you down, help you sleep.
We'll get all this sorted out.
I want you to take a big gulp of that.
A big gulp of that.
That's a good girl.
~ Well done.
~ I don't like it.
No.
It's horrible, isn't it?
Medicine always is.
But it's gonna help everything.
Snuggle down, now.
Come on.
Snuggle down.
Snug as a bug.
I'm just downstairs.
I'm worried about Lisa.
Everything's gonna be all right.
We've got to clear this mess up.
Pippa heard you having sex.
She thinks you killed Lisa.
Did you give her that stuff from the flask?
She'll be asleep now.
~ What are you doing?
Where's Pippa?
~ Look, I'll explain.
We haven't got much time.
Just drive.
Just drive!
~ Stay back from me.
~ Quiet!
What are we doing?
Where's Pippa?
~ Tell me where she is, now!
~ Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
~ Where is Pippa?
~ You need to stay calm, right?
~ I gave her some stuff from your flask, like you said.
~ Right.
What was in there?
That wasn't just whisky, was it?
~ What happened?
~ She had a reaction.
She couldn't breathe.
She was choking, and it was...
It was just so, so fast.
~ What are you telling me?
~ We couldn't call an ambulance Ricky, not with what you've done... .. to Lisa, with blood all over the floor!
We...couldn't save her.
She's gone.
No.
~ No!
~ I'm so sorry.
No.
You don't say that!
Lee said he knows somewhere peaceful, somewhere you used to go, where she won't be found for a while.
That's why we're here.
You can go and look.
I'll wait here.
I'll wait here.
Ricky!
Gimme the keys.
Listen.
I've got to tell you this.
I've buried your hip flask in the woods here.
I know exactly where, but nobody else will be able to find it.
If you feel like you wanna talk to the police, or you blame us, remember, I know where your hip flask is that contains traces that killed Pippa.
It's just a precaution.
That's all.
Nothing else.
You've thought it all through, haven't you?
I've got to think of the future.
I only came home that night to tell him I was pregnant.
We've got a pretty clear picture of the events of that night.
But we wanna hear it from you.
We know you killed Lisa.
~ But where did you bury her body?
~ No comment.
No, no, no, no.
Don't do that.
Cate broke your alibi weeks ago.
There were hours when she didn't see you at the wedding.
She assumed you were off sleeping with a bridesmaid, Tiffany Evans.
~ But Tiffany said otherwise.
~ And I did a lot of checking with every cab company in your area.
Unfortunately for you, the cab company that took you home have got a computerised system.
They keep really good records.
Your journey details, times, all paid up.
~ No comment.
~ Seriously?
My daughter was the same age as Pippa when this happened.
My heart went out to you.
I knew how you felt.
I couldn't let you down.
That's what I always thought.
Two years, never letting go!
I nearly killed myself over this, and you're gonna "no comment" me?
!
So, is there anything else you want to say to us?
I got my punishment that night.
What did you do with Lisa's body?
Lee was working at a church.
There was a funeral the day before.
So... .. best place to hide a body.
A grave.
Did you not find any traces of Rohypnol in Pippa's body?
Passes through the system in 24 hours.
We didn't find her for a few days.
And besides, they watered it down.
You did it.
You got them.
Done my penance.
I just keep thinking of all the damage done... .. all those lives.
~ That's Beth.
She's here.
Do you mind if I...
~ No, go.
Well done.
Go on.
I think you're wrong, by the way.
You're wrong, what you said to Lee in there.
We're not all alone.
Hope you're right about that.
~ I wasn't sure you'd come.
~ I can't believe you asked.
Anyway, I never miss a chance to be belittled.
~ I want to work with you.
~ You wanna what?
I'm not ready to stop.
In fact I'm just getting going again.
~ You don't want to end on a loss.
~ No, I bloody don't,
~ and especially not to you.
~ Why would I ever want to work with you again?
Because I bring prestige, which matters.
Don't protest!
I'm brilliant.
I'd be your conscience, challenge what you do, and I still think you need that.
I think you're wrong about the law.
I understand why, but it is a calling.
It is noble.
And I think... you need to get that back.
~ I don't need a tutor.
~ Yes, you do.
We all do.
It wouldn't work.
I'm sorry, but no.
I've done some work on this.
They're wrong about your son's case.
I think there could be grounds for appeal.
Where did you get these files?
They're the originals you sent me.
And you kept them, even though you don't like me very much.
I don't have to like you.
But I have to believe in you.
I've spent too much time here recently being afraid.
I need a way back in.
Get out.
~ No!
~ What's the matter?
You worried about what could happen?
Get out!
Mark, what are you gonna do to me?
Please, don't!
No!
I trusted you.
Oh, my God!
~ Sit down.
~ Where's...
Sit down!
Do you know how many knives there are in here?
14.
I counted 'em while I was waiting.
~ Thought which'd be best to use on you.
~ I'm sorry!
~ No, no, no.
Don't open your mouth.
You don't get to speak.
You could've kept... one bit of your humanity.
You could've faced up to what you've done... .. taken your punishment.
Been a decent human being.
What...
What am I saying?
You're not that.
You can't ever have been.
When you die... .. no-one will mourn for you.
We could kill you in here, dump your body on a beach.
And no-one'd care.
No-one'd notice.
But we're more than you.
We...
I will not be broken by this.
We all get to live.
But you... .. you've no life left.
Not here.
I was found innocent.
Shut up!
Just shut up, you piece of shit!
~ I'm sorry.
~ You're not sorry!
If you were sorry, you'd have pleaded guilty.
You heard what she said.
You are leaving.
You are never coming back.
And you will never see either of your children again.
~ You can't do that.
~ Oh, I can do that.
If you try and see them, if you follow them, if you go to their schools, if you contact them in any way,
I will kill you.
And unlike you, I will face the consequences.
You are dead to us.
Do you understand?
Now you're coming with us.
Up.
Your bags are in the cab.
It'll take you to Bournemouth train station.
A vicar friend of mine will meet you there and make sure you get on the train to Sheffield.
I've got you into a halfway house.
From there... .. you're on your own.
~ You think you can banish me?
~ We're sure of it, Joe.
~ What time's your taxi coming?
~ Um, about half an hour.
~ You don't have to wait.
~ Right.
~ I couldn't have done this without you.
~ No, you couldn't.
~ And you didn't.
~ Seriously.
~ Don't be nice to me.
It's not how it works.
~ All right.
So, where are you gonna go?
Er, I dunno.
Um...
Close to Daisy.
I need to be near my daughter.
Yeah.
Quite right.
Well...
OK.
Thanks for everything.
~ Handshake?
~ Yeah.
Not hugging you.
Look after yourself, Miller.
~ What about Joe?
~ Er, it's been dealt with.
I miss him so much.
Me too.
We haven't shown you this place, have we?
We can't never come here.
We can't... miss out.
Not on somewhere this beautiful.
We lost your brother here, darlin'.
He would've loved you.
Would've loved having a little sister to boss around.
I have to reclaim it for you now, Lizzie.
And for us.
Keep our love as strong as steel.
That's the way we win.
~ Yeah.
~ Hey!
You're late!
Yeah, but we've got crisps!
~ Hello!
~ Hello, Fred!
Yeah, he likes that, don't he?
~ He's a cutie, ain't he?
~ Hello.
~ How you doing?
~ All right.
~ Hey, pretty girl!
~ She's got a little red nose.
~ Oh, you have!
~ Hello.
How you doing?
~ All right.
~ Hello.
~ Have you said hello to everybody?
Yeah!
Where to, then, sir?
All right.
Where's your father?
Are we getting a sub?
I don't want a sub.
You never know where they've been.
Will you calm down?
He's one minute late.
Stop overreacting.
What if he never shows up?
What if I never learn anything else?
I'm going down, sir!
Oh, he's not even here.
We lost Farkle.
A little help, Maya?
Matthews is out, Farkle is down, it's Maya time.
Farkle's fixed.
No Maya time.
You may proceed.
During Maya time, we open the confiscation drawer and take back all the stuff from the land of unfairly taken toys.
Maya!
I don't think anybody really wants...
All right, whose is this?
What'd I miss?
Maya!
He is going to walk in and catch you and you're going to be in trouble and I am here to keep you out of trouble, and I will have failed.
Do you want me to fail?
Do you want me to show you how to have fun?
Behaving is fun.
- Come here!
- I really don't want to.
You come here right now.
Ring power!
When we say "ring power" you have to.
It's a rule.
Tell me this isn't fun.
Yeah, that seems like fun, but now you did it, so I don't get to do it, so are we sitting down now?
- Of course there's another one!
- Do it.
There is nothing in this world that can make me do it.
Ring power.
What'd I miss?
When did you guys decide there are no rules in here?
When did my generosity in allowing you to express yourselves make you think you could turn my class into a zoo?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Lucas.
Why are you the only one here that didn't say I'm sorry?
Because I never do anything.
No.
Because you respect the rules.
Because you know without them, civilization becomes chaos.
The rest of you are gonna spend the afternoon thinking about that, with the exception of Lucas the good.
Oh, boy!
Is that gonna stick?
I'm already making t-shirts.
You put me in a real bad position here, sir.
I gotta do something.
You can fight this, Lucas.
No, I can't, sir.
Everyone's looking.
Okay.
Do what you gotta do.
- Detention.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- Feel better, huckleberry?
- I'm just like you now.
Yeah, we're exactly the same.
Yeah, you're all the same.
Detention, all of you!
What do you want?
I'm going to be home late today, daddy.
I know, honey.
I've always allowed you to bend the rules.
But the best of students know just how far they can push before those rules are broken.
Today you are not the best of students.
But you know we're good people most of the time, don't you, daddy?
Daddy?
You're my daddy.
Why do we need rules at all?
You think you could make it in a world without rules?
I think I could do fine in any world.
The rest of you believe that?
Okay.
Well, guess what, guys.
School's out.
You've got the whole place to yourselves.
No rules.
One hour to behave however you want.
Let's see what becomes of you.
Well, I think we'll be perfectly behaved ladies and gentlemen.
And I think within one minute you'll be eating each other.
- Where are you going?
- I'm locking you in.
The best punishment I can give is to force you to spend some time with yourselves.
I'll see you in an hour.
Whoever's left.
I can't believe it.
He locked us in.
That's fine.
I don't have a problem with that.
I'm not claustrophobic or anything.
We're trapped.
I can't breathe.
There's more carbon dioxide than oxygen!
The ratio is all wrong!
Okay.
Farkle gotsta go.
I gotsta?
Stop.
This is exactly what my father wants.
He wants us to panic and fall apart.
We have to show him that we can get through this without turning into a pack of wild animals.
I'm hungry.
What do you mean by that?
Nothing.
I'm just really hungry.
Because we're best friends.
Yeah, you know what else?
I don't think I've ever been this hungry.
I feel ya, ranger Rick.
I'm kinda hungry, too.
And it's not like a regular kind of hungry, right?
No.
No.
This one's deep.
It must be attended to.
Oh, guys, can we just show a little discipline?
I mean, how much more time in here could we possibly have?
You know, I could eat, too.
What?
What are you looking at?
Guys!
What are you seeing right now?
Stop talking, chicken.
All right, come on!
Let's prove my father wrong.
Let's form our own perfect society.
Rileytown is a land of goodness and rainbows where everybody folds their hands nicely like so.
Who wants to live in Rileytown?
Nobody wants Rileytown!
It's too lollipop!
You're lollipop!
Sister, I'm a lot of things, but I ain't lollipop.
Rileytown has order, structure and our hands folded like so!
What do you got?
I got Mayaville!
No rules, no laws, no hand folding and nobody says no!
No.
You got chaos is what you got!
I got order, you got chaos!
You got lollipop, I got whoo!
Okay, detention may be bringing out the worst in us, but at least we're making the time pass.
Eat Riley!
Okay.
But no biting.
Oh, yay, it's you.
Go easy on me, Topy.
I'm vulnerable today.
Ava?
What happened?
What happened?
Emma Weathersbee happened!
She's makin' inroads, man!
Auggie!
Ava, whatever's going on, it's not worth shoving your face in the cake.
Dude, why would I do that?
This face takes hours.
- Join me?
- No, I couldn't possibly...
Oh!
There's actually not gonna be any left, is there?
Okay, shove over.
Emma Weathersbee does this thing I can't even begin to compete with.
What does she do?
Oh, it's all just so obvious and your dopey son is falling for it.
Okay, what does Emma do?
She's nice.
She's polite.
She says "please" and "thank you"
and "may I" and...
I don't want to live in this kind of world!
Okay, Ava, what do you want me to do for you?
Could you make me likable?
Honey, I don't see how.
Topanga, I know how I come across.
But I also know that if you just give me a chance, deep down inside me, there may be a beautiful, shining soul.
Oh, honey!
How was that?
Oh, you just want me to help you be fake nice?
I ain't lookin' for miracles.
I just want your kid back.
Here's what I know, deep down inside you, in your beautiful, shining soul, you actually see the good in me.
Aw, honey.
How was that?
Why are you guys over there?
Why can't we just be one happy society that runs the way I think it should?
Because you want us all to be you.
We're not all you, Riley.
I mean, you know the reason I've never been able to choose between you?
Because if it was you all the time, life would be like...
And if it was you all the time, life would be like...
Descensus in cuniculi cavum!
I need to be both of you guys.
But who are you going to be with right now, Farkle?
Before you answer that, you may want to consider a little thing I call... this.
He forgot to lock the back door?
Maya, we're in detention.
You can't leave.
Hey.
School's out.
He said we got the place to ourselves.
He said to make our own rules.
See you around, suckers.
Farkle?
Hey.
What part of "descensus in cuniculi cavum" do you not understand?
All of it.
It means we drop down into the rabbit hole, man.
- Lucas?
- I never do anything, Riley.
Yeah!
Okay.
We don't need them.
We can just be in here, hands folded like so.
So, what do you guys want to talk about?
Oh, that's right.
You guys don't talk, do you?
Well, the first rule of Rileytown is that everybody in here gets to talk.
You there.
What do you have to say?
Hi.
My name is Dave.
I like corn chips and I'm sorry I didn't go with the other group.
Dave!
I mean, don't get us wrong.
We really respect you and everything.
- You do?
- We always have.
You're one of the good ones and we'd follow you anywhere.
Thank you.
It's just that without the others, we're kinda bored out of our minds.
Dave!
We're safe and sound and not getting into trouble.
Yeah, but the problem with that is, all the good kids are in here.
We just know that they're having a lot more fun out there.
What're you doing in here?
They're having a lot more fun out there.
We're in detention, janitor harley.
How 'bout that.
Little zippy crossed the line.
Maya influenced me.
I've noticed that over the years.
You do realize the back door is wide open don't you, little zippy?
We're aware.
And yet this group stays in here, while the other group is rampaging down the hallway.
Well, what do you make of that?
I'm sure we'll find out.
This lesson has your father written all over it.
You're supposed to lock the front door.
Actually, I'm not.
It's time to find out what Maya is up to.
Goodbye.
Maya will be fine.
Lucas and Farkle won't let her get into trouble.
- She's stronger than them.
- She's better when you're with her.
Oh, please. 14 years of good influence can't possibly come apart in...
Okay, well, this is less fun when there's no one to chase.
Everybody else is in detention.
I'm finally cool and nobody notices.
Okay.
Okay.
Watch this.
Huh!
Also, ow!
Maya...
If there's no good kids out here noticing us, then, what's the point?
You questioning my leadership, hop-along?
Okay, these names you're calling me are killing my street cred.
Aw!
And what would you like me to call you?
I'd like you to call me "mad dog."
You don't seem like a mad dog to me.
What do I seem like to you?
You know that lamb that Mary had?
I don't like the way that this is going.
I think what mad dog is saying is what good is being bad if there's no other kind of people around?
I'm Batman.
Who's that?
I agree with mad dog and Batman.
For me, it was very important for us to be amongst the good.
Why?
Because even bad kids have good parts.
But without the good kids, you may never find out what they are.
You told us you were one of the bad kids when you were younger.
Well, you know, I used to intimidate people.
Make 'em see things my way.
- Did they?
- For a while.
- Then what happened?
- I met a good kid.
But you seem like such a nice guy.
It's hard for me to believe you ever intimidated anything.
Oh, yeah?
Okay.
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we need a good kid around.
To find the good in us.
Yeah.
Let's go steal one.
Duck.
Duck.
Duck.
She's actually too nice to make someone the goose.
Without Maya around, she's actually getting worse.
Duck.
Hi.
Wait!
Duck!
Okay!
Why are you guys lookin' at me like that?
- Help us.
- Make us more like you.
Okay.
You guys want to have some fun?
Everybody clean off your faces, you look ridiculous.
Lucas,
I'll get you.
Thank you.
You know, they call me "mad dog".
Of course they do.
Would you call me "mad dog"?
Would you call me "princess dancing sunshine"?
No, I would not.
Well, there you go.
I'm home!
What a day!
We all have bad days, August.
Please.
I'm sure you did your best.
Thank you.
May I?
What the...
I told you I didn't think I could do this.
What did you do to her?
Honey, she asked me to!
I would change myself completely if it meant not losing you to miss Emma Weathersbee.
Ava.
You're not Emma.
Be Ava.
I don't want two Emmas.
I can't stand being polite all day.
- You can't?
- No.
It makes me want to draw with a black crayon.
You want two Avas?
No!
"Please" and "thank you" are all right, but sometimes a guy's gotta hear "give me" and "I want!"
Well, I want to take off this stupid hat!
And I want to take off this stupid dress!
And I want cheese!
Give me!
Ava, we're having tea right now.
Let me tell you what I think about tea...
No!
I will get you some cheese.
Topanga...
- Yes?
- Thank you.
Wow, Ava.
You know, inside of there, there really is a sweet little girl after all.
Aw, Topy...
How was that?
Pretty good.
You have fun?
I did.
It was quite enjoyable.
And you?
Someone had the idea to put me in a bag.
- Did you hear about that?
- Really?
Well, you know, there's some bad kids out there.
Okay, guys.
Detention over.
- Dad.
- Yeah?
Remember how you told us that people change people?
Secret of life.
Well, when you're not with those people, how do you keep from changing back?
You went a little wild, did you?
Whatever I got is strong in me, Matthews.
Yeah, me, too, but the other way.
- Harley!
- Right here.
- You watched them?
- Like a hawk.
- Wait!
- You're with him?
Yeah.
He's my good kid.
What do you got?
Everyone went nuts, except for zippy.
Why didn't you go nuts, zippy?
I was without Maya.
Without Maya, I don't think I'd ever unfold my hands.
What about this one here?
Maya was the ringleader.
Maya was the first one out the door.
I was without Riley.
Without Riley, I may never come back.
Okay.
Well, detention over, guys.
Everyone out.
Except Maya.
- Dad...
- Everyone out.
So, you were like me.
What changed you?
Well, it turns out there is always two doors.
He showed me the other one.
It's good to know there's someone like that around.
Okay, so...
How long did it take for you to go full-blown Maya?
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
That's four minutes better than last time.
So, you weren't there this morning?
Yeah, the subway was late or something...
Or something.
You know, Maya, it's a good thing to know, I don't always have to be in this room to give my students a test.
And it's a good thing we got people who check up on us every once in a while.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, what's next?
I sit here another hour.
Maya, whatever you end up deciding to be, the best thing I can teach you right now is that there are consequences to our actions.
The rules are there to help us.
I'll try harder next time.
I know.
- Hey, Matthews.
- Yeah?
Next time I'm gonna put some war paint on Riley's face.
Yeah.
I'm sure she's counting on it.
Riley!
Right here.
Thanks for coming over, Ava.
I had a real good time.
Me too, Auggie.
Tomorrow, I want to talk about me more and I want to watch my TV shows and I want to talk about me more.
Sounds good.
See you tomorrow.
- Topanga!
- Yes!
Throw me out!
I had the same idea.
Whee!
- Thank you!
- My pleasure.
I never thought I'd say this, but she is really starting to grow on me.
Really?
Because I decided that if you still didn't like her
I was never going to see her again, because your happiness is more important than anything to me.
Aw, honey...
How was that?
Joshua:
In the beginning, astarfellfromheaven
Andchangedus .
Madeusangels andgaveus anew destiny:
Tostoptheapocalypse
Andthedevilhimself.
Wemustpassgod 'stest
Andprovehumanity isstillworthsaving.
Forwearethe messengers.
Erin:
Previously on the messengers...
Eliza:
Your daughter's been touched with a gift of her own.
Amy:
Togetheragain,
Just like my drawing.
Is this all of us?
Who's that?
That's my friend michael.
He likes soccer.
You promised me if i listened to your stories,
I'd get my son back.
Now where is michael?
What the hell is this?
The man:
St. Monica.
The patron saint of mothers.
I saw these two boys in my vision.
Vera:
I've seen them twice today, too.
It's definitely a sign.
These brothers must be connected
To the next horseman.
How is rose any different from the rest of us?
The man:
Because
Rose is the horseman of death.
Rest in peace, joshua.
(gasps)
We can't save him, he's dead.
He doesn't have to be.
What do you mean?
What if i told you
I can bring him back from the dead?
That if you give me what i want,
I'll resurrect your friend?
The man:
All right, dear messengers,
Take a moment and ask yourselves:
What would joshua do?
He would do anything to save one of us.
Except for make a deal with the devil.
But eliza said we can't defeat the horsemen
Unless all seven messengers are truly united.
We can't defeat anyone without joshua.
No, you can't.
You need a man of vision,
Which means you need to share his latest vision with me,
Or...
I will leave him for dead.
And you can all go back to the bar and cry in your beer.
If you want to know what his visions are,
Then you need him alive just as much as we do.
Do i?
I'll give you till the count of ten.
One...
It's a mistake.
Don't listen to him.
Two...
What choice do we have?
Three...
How do we know this isn't just a lie?
Four...
We don't.
Five...
We want the same thing.
Yeah, but for different reasons.
Six...
Seven...
Guys, we don't have a choice.
Eight...
We're just gonna give the devil what he wants?
Nine...
Vera:
Joshua will be damned if we do,
But we'll all be damned if we don't.
Ten-- now tell me what i want to hear
And don't lie to me,
Or there will be hell to pay.
Plowman family farms.
Damn it, vera!
That's what joshua saw in his last vision.
The logo with a photo of the two brothers,
Mark and vincent--
They own the company.
The headquarters is in california.
That's what we know.
Farming and famine.
Sounds like a perfect match.
Okay, you got what you wanted.
Now bring joshua back.
Don't rush me, boy.
(eerie chanting)
(stops chanting)
Vera:
Joshua.
(gasping)
What have you done?
So the devil really brought me back to life?
Vera:
Yeah.
And rose really killed you?
She's the horseman of death.
Look, you didn't tell her anything
About your visions, right?
Not about plowman farms or...
No.
I lied.
No one knows
About the real vision but us.
And the devil.
Erin:
But at least
We've got you back.
Peter:
But...
H-how do we know
What our next move is?
Joshua:
I know what to do.
And as long as i'm alive I will not let us fail.
(train horn blaring)
Joshua:
I did a little research.
The plowmans are holding a public press conference
The day after tomorrow
And we gotta get there.
So we're gonna train hop
All the way to california?
Tickets, please.
Just messing with you.
You're like a michael jackson video, you know that?
So we're not sitting together?
You're lucky you got seats at all.
It's not easy hustling tickets for wanted fugitives.
All aboard.
Cindy:
I have no doubt once you have
A full grasp of operation genesis,
You'll see that your hacking skills
Will come in very handy.
You're sure the devil
Won't find out about this?
How would he?
He seems to have his ways.
Let's face it:
Horsemen have worked with him for six generations.
He's always been able to talk them out of the apocalypse.
Not this time.
He just wants to hold onto his playground.
We have a purpose.
(train horn blares)
We stop in albuquerque next,
Then on to california.
Should put us right in time for the event
Tomorrow at plowman headquarters.
And get this:
These brothers, mark and vincent,
They're not just farmers.
They're big players
In the genetically modified seed industry.
Supposed to announce some new technology
That's been kept under wraps.
I wonder if that has anything to do
With breaking the next horseman's seal.
Maybe...
But let me ask you this:
What was it like?
What was what like?
To be dead.
In my culture,
We believe in reincarnation.
Just not the way you did it.
So i'm curious.
Do you remember anything?
I saw a tunnel of light.
You know, the one everyone always talks about?
And i was headed right toward heaven.
And then, suddenly, i felt an ice-cold hand
On the back of my neck,
Yanking me back.
And it still feels like
The devil's got me tight in his grip.
I know why y'all brought me back.
But what if i go to hell for it?
Pick a card.
Come on...
This is the first card trick
My father ever taught me.
Learned it when i was, like, six.
It's called "dead man's hand."
Just pick one, all right?
And memorize it and put it back.
And your card is...
Not here.
You don't see it, do you?
Mm-mm.
That's weird.
Check your pocket.
Come on...
Your card?
It's still a good trick, though.
Wait, that never...
That never happens.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
I know this trick like the back of my hand.
What the hell is wrong with me?
I, uh...
It's getting worse.
What is?
Um, i've been forgetting things.
Like, things that i've known all my life.
It just...
It started not too long ago.
After you got your gift?
You just shape-shifted at the train station, right?
Yeah.
So?
Maybe the memory problems
Are the cost of your gift.
(sighs)
(gasps)
You had a vision.
What was it?
There's a storm coming.
Vera:
I'm telling you, amy has some kind of gift.
See?
Rose isn't in this.
Somehow amy knew she wasn't a messenger.
You just said she also drew
The devil at the last supper.
I mean, what are you feeding this kid?
And this--
Michael's soccer uniform--
It's the same one
I saw in the video the devil showed me.
And the "m"...
It could be for michael.
Did you ever show the video to amy?
No.
She says it's her imaginary friend.
I mean, somehow she has to be
Connected to all of this, right?
Are you sure she's not a messenger?
I mean, if she is, we haven't seen her wings.
Well, the bible's full of characters.
Maybe amy's got a different role to play.
How are you doing?
Honestly, not great.
I gotta get amy away from all this.
You know?
Rose, the devil,
The things that she's seen...
And now she's drawing pictures
That seem to predict the future.
I mean, i'm really worried about her.
Sucks to be a parent, huh?
Sometimes.
You ever thought about being one?
I am.
(laughs):
What?
What do you mean?
Gabriela told me That i'm nadia's father.
Conductor (over p.A.):
Attention, passengers.
Our next stop is albuquerque.
V, wait up!
Uh, excuse me, sorry, sorry.
V, what are you doing?
It's just a quick stop.
Oh, my god.
No way.
St. Monica, patron saint of mothers.
Want to buy a cupcake?
We're raising money for our school soccer program.
Mi-michael?
Mi...
Michael.
Oh, um...
Uh, yeah, chocolate, uh, please?
Do you know this boy?
Guys!
Brian fairburn.
Yeah, i babysit for him all the time.
Guys, the train's about to leave!
Can i borrow this a second?
Sure.
I think i just found michael.
What are you talking about?
Look at number three.
That boy's my son.
That-that-that's the same boy
From the videos i saw.
And the same boy from amy's drawings.
And-and look...
The medallion the devil gave me.
St. Monica.
It's the same name as this school.
Look, we gave him what he wanted,
And i think the devil's given me a clue to find my son.
Or it could be just another one of his tricks.
But what if it isn't?
I can't leave without knowing for sure.
We can't give up on the mission.
It's not safe for any of us to be alone right now.
She's not alone.
I'm staying, too.
Vera, look at me.
I know how important this is to you.
But you cannot leave.
It's my son.
(p.A. Chiming)
Conductor:
Attention, all passengers.
This is the final boarding call for the westbound train.
You need to tell nadia as soon as we get back.
I know.
She already blames me for losing her dad.
It's like, if i tell her this, then it's like
I'm taking him away from her all over again.
No, you're not taking anything away from her.
You're just giving her the truth.
Why did you tell me?
Because the last time i wasn't honest with you,
I almost lost you.
And i don't want that to happen ever again.
Do you still have feelings for gabriela?
Nah.
I have feelings for you.
Man:
Sonofabitch!
That'sthatkidwanted formurder.
(quietly):
Peter...
Peter, wake up.
You've been made.
Keep him here, okay?
Erin:
Yeah.
Come on!
Answer the phone.
Woman:
Police headquarters.
How may i direct your call?
Hey!
This is deputy landis out of flagstaff.
Look, i'm off-duty, but i need to report a... (grunting)
Sir?
Sir, are you there?
(phone beeps off)
(train horn blows)
I can't take you anywhere, can i?
We gotta go.
What's going on?
Josh just had a vision.
I saw a tree with a blue tire swing.
And then rain started to fall--
Red rain-- and-and everything just turned to dust.
The next seal maybe?
Well, i hate to say it, but we got other problems.
Cop just i.D.'d peter.
We gotta get off the train.
But we need to get to the plowman brothers.
Change of plans.
No.
Listen to me.
We already lost vera and alan.
The rest of us have to stay on point.
We can't do that behind bars.
Peter's not the only one who's a fugitive here.
Erin's wanted, i'm wanted.
What do we do?
Koa, cover me.
(alarm rings)
Everything's all right, folks.
Just a quick maintenance check.
We'll be back on our way in a jiffy.
(echoing, indistinct voice;
becoming clearer)
Joshua:
...No, guys, we can't do this.
We can figure it out, but we got to stick together!
Then we're screwed, josh!
If we stay on the train,
The entire mission gets derailed.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm good.
Erin:
Look, we'll meet you at the plowmans.
Okay?
Promise.
(door hisses open)
Who knew this trip could actually get longer?
I think the correct response to somebody
Who saved your ass is thank you.
Would you guys stop it?
At least, we found a road.
It's got to lead somewhere, right?
Hopefully to the next town.
We can catch a bus from there.
Yeah, according to my gps,
That's just a short 47-mile walk.
Can you look up some good news on that thing, please?
What about that?
Raul:
Welcome to farmville.
(various animals bleating and mooing in distance)
Erin:
It's dry as a bone out here.
This place has seen better days.
(calf bellows in distance)
Peter:
Hey, buddy.
Why you over here by yourself?
Raul:
Peter...
Guys, check it out.
Whoa.
Do you think this is the tree from joshua's vision?
Hey, use that phone of yours and ask him.
Maybe we can sweet-talk these people into giving us a ride?
Erin:
Yeah.
Well, according to joshua,
We're definitely here for a reason.
Something we can do for you folks?
Look, i-i'm sorry.
We don't mean to bother you.
We were actually just hoping you might be able
To give us a ride into town.
Yeah, our car broke down a few miles back.
Earl cowan.
Hi.
Sorry to hear you folks are stranded.
Tom's a pretty good mechanic.
Could, uh, tow you out and take a look.
Oh, thanks.
It's pretty bad.
Threw a rod, i think.
Engine's blown.
Really not worth the tow charges.
Yeah, we just need a ride.
Maybe to the nearest bus station?
Well, i suppose we could give you a lift.
But it's an hour into town and it's, uh,
Just about suppertime.
Y'all must be hungry.
Care to join us?
(quiet laugh)
Yeah.
Sure.
We'd be honored.
Come on in.
Thanks.
Hey, v, shouldn't we, uh,
At least think this through a second?
I mean, what are you gonna do?
You just gonna walk in there and take your kid back?
You're damn right!
Okay, but...
Well, shouldn't we at least call the cops first?
Or-or-or liam neeson?
Look!
I'm tired of waiting.
I want my son!
(knocking on door)
Answer the door!
Hey, hey, hey!
Take it easy!
I don't think anyone's home.
No.
No, come...
No, come...
Okay.
(grunts)
Ah, yeah.
Okay.
You're heavy when you're dead, you know that?
Vera!
Hey, i found a hide-a-key.
Vera!
(alan grunts, vera gasps)
You're scaring me.
I need to show you something.
This was his room.
Oh, vera, i'm...
I'm sorry.
(quiet laugh)
It's a model of the solar system.
He got an a-plus.
Alan:
I don't get it.
Why would they just leave like this?
(sniffling):
I don't know, alan.
Vera:
Wait.
Yes, i do.
(squeaks)
Son of a bitch.
Alan, he told them we were coming.
The devil's behind this.
That's why they're not here!
Erin:
And after that adventure,
My first time riding a horse was also my last.
(everybody chuckles)
Well, i'm sorry we don't have more to offer you.
That was the last of the berries.
From our very last harvest at that.
Your very last harvest?
Well, it's been a bad few seasons across the valley.
Just can't seem to shake the drought.
Even with our own irrigation system,
We still haven't been able to turn things around.
Crops keep dying.
Afraid we've done all we can.
Well, we prayed and prayed for a miracle,
And tom here finally brought us one.
Peter:
How so?
Well, he introduced us to those nice folks
From plowman family farms.
They're, uh, buying us out,
Like they did every other suffering farm in the valley.
Gladys:
Well, we didn't know what we were gonna do.
We're always the last holdout.
Tom:
Plowmans cover every base.
Soil treatment, improved seed, irrigation.
They're actually about to start testing their technology
On farms across the valley.
Once they do that,
They'll turn this place from a dirt patch
Into a bumper crop, in no time.
All i got to do is sign the contracts,
And then we'll be part of the plowman family.
You'll have to excuse earl.
Nerves a bit frazzled lately.
His great-grandfather started this farm,
And it's hard for him to let it go.
Tom:
Butit'saboutdamntime .
What about your first job?
No.
Your first boyfriend?
Nothing.
Okay.
What about the neighborhood you grew up in?
Do you remember any of that?
Koa:
Itusedto be so clear.
It was a good day.
Now,forsomereason, itjust...
It'sallablur.
Now i can't even remember my own father's face.
What's happening to me?
My opinion is that it has to do with your gift.
Now, hear me out.
You shape-shifted at the train station,
And then you forgot the trick your father taught you.
Then you morphed into the conductor,
And now these memories are gone.
So?
So...
By stealing people's identities,
Maybe you're losing track of your own.
These gifts we've been given,
They weren't just doled out at random.
Each one of them speaks to something
That we need to learn about ourselves.
You were raised a con artist, right?
Yeah.
So your whole past is about manipulating folks.
Then maybe your future should be about helping them.
How do i know that's gonna help me?
Well, that's just it.
Being a messenger isn't about you.
It's about everyone else.
Erin:
"it's about damn time."
You're sure that's what you heard tom thinking?
Yeah, it was weird.
I don't know-- he seems like such a nice guy.
Maybe he's just frustrated over watching the farm fail.
Joshua must have had a vision of this place for a reason, right?
I mean, it's about to be taken over
By the same brothers we're looking at as horsemen.
But why?
I don't know.
But we're supposed to be here-- i'm sure of it.
(grunting, bellowing)
Come on.
Yeah, this way, this way.
This way.
So why do you keep these two apart, anyway?
'cause that one over there's his mother,
But this one,
He's gonna be a bull one day.
Might as well get used to it, right?
Earl:
We'll need to hurry to town
If you want to catch the last night bus.
Or you're welcome to bunk in our guest room,
Get a fresh start in the morning.
If it's not too much trouble, we'd love to stay.
No trouble.
Thanks.
So this is what you were telling me about.
The meteorite contains every element known to man,
Plus one we've never seen before.
But every time we try to extract it,
Let's just say it becomes very volatile.
Well, in that case, my esteemed guest and i would like to see
The extraction process for ourselves.
This evening.
Madam secretary, you don't understand.
I Think i understand perfectly.
I cannot continue to put my people in harm's way just so...
Doctor...
It's either your people Or you.
Can't sleep?
All my life, i've been a preacher.
But i was just selling my old man's snake oil.
Then i met rose,
And finally thought i had something real to believe in.
She played you, joshua.
But you're not the only one who fell for it.
Maybe not.
But i used to lead people, koa.
Inspire them.
Now nobody listens to me.
I couldn't even keep six of us on a train.
Maybe you weren't supposed to.
There's an old taoist saying--
"when the best leader's work is done,
The people say, 'we did it ourselves.'"
You're a good leader, joshua.
You just need to listen to your own advice.
Yeah, what's that?
It's not about you.
It's about everyone else.
Tom:
Damn,thissaltisheavy.
Plowmanain'tpayingmeenough forthiscrap.
(indistinct radio communication)
Simon:
Once the solution mixes with the pulverized meteor sample
Inside the centrifuge,
The genesis element should be in its purest form for collection.
But each time, it resists extraction,
Almost like it's defending itself.
I'm begging you to reconsider.
Now, doctor.
You heard the lady.
Do as you're told.
Initialize.
Yes, sir.
Technicians (over radio):
Initiated.
(technician screams)
Now do you see?
No matter what we try, it ends in disaster.
Wrong.
It's incredible.
Isn't it?
Oh, i think we're well on our way to creating
The most destructive weapon the world has ever known.
Seven years of searching, dead end after dead end,
And now i've abandoned everybody who needs me
To go on a wild goose chase.
No, it was a good lead-- you had to follow it.
The devil was never gonna give me my son back, okay?
How could i have trusted him?
Vera, you are closer now than ever to finding michael.
I need better than "closer," alan.
I need my son.
(tranquilizer gun fires)
(gasps):
Ow...
Alan?
Alan?
!
Alan?
!
Alan...
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
Get off of me...
What the hell did you do?
Nothing!
Did you shoot her?
No.
She pass out?
No, man, she's dead.
Are you kidding me?
We followed them all the way from texas.
Richards wants her alive.
(engine revving, tires screeching)
Just get them in the car.
Let's get the hell out of here.
(engine revving, tires screeching)
(gasps)
(calf bleating, grunting)
(mooing)
Hey, bud.
(bellows)
You're not gonna give up, are you?
(bellows)
(bellows, grunts)
Let's go see mom.
(calf bellowing)
(mooing)
(calf bleats)
Hope you have an appetite.
Gladys makes the best eggs and hash around.
(gladys laughs quietly)
Thank you.
Morning, earl.
Morning.
Mind tasting this?
It's water from your irrigation tank.
(spits)
It's salty!
You want to tell him, or should i?
Tell me what?
Who the hell you think you are?
I saw tom pouring salt into the tank last night.
Don't listen to him, earl.
That would kill all the crops.
Exactly.
Wh-why would you do a thing like that?
I didn't.
He did.
I'm guessing he's been poisoning the water supply
To make the farm fail, so you'd be forced to sell.
You been like a son to me, tom.
You tell me the truth.
(exhales)
Selling's for your own good, and you know it, earl-- you do--
And you're so damn stubborn,
I was just trying to get you a fair price
Before you had to give the farm away.
How much of a price you get from the plowman family
For selling them out?
Gladys...
Call the sheriff.
(door shuts, engine starts)
Peter, stop him!
(metal groaning, clanking, creaking)
Earl:
Well,
I don't know how y'all did it, but you did it.
Better head out the back way.
You sure about this?
Go on, take it.
It's the least we can do.
Mm.
Don't worry, we'll bring your truck back
After we meet up with our friends.
We aren't worried.
I told you we prayed for a miracle to save our farm and...
Now we know-- you all were the real miracle.
Earl:
I just tore up that contract from the plowmans.
Thank you.
You ready to get back on mission?
I think that was the mission.
(engine starts)
(lively, indistinct conversations)
Don't worry, they'll be here.
Hey, you made it.
Yeah-- 100 miles an hour, no patrolmen in sight.
Thank god.
Anyone hear from vera and alan?
No.
Not a word.
(crowd applauds, cheers)
That's them.
That's the plowmans.
Howdy, folks.
Plowman family farms is proud
To present to the world...
The greatest agricultural breakthrough in a century.
Tomorrow, at farms all across
The drought-stricken central valley,
We launch a cutting-edge,
New rainmaking system--
One that not only seeds clouds
But also fortifies them
With a nutrient-rich water source
We call...
Smart rain.
The tree in your vision-- wasn't it killed by rain?
Woman:
Yeah!
Vincent:
Now as many of you will realize, i am
Not exactly the science guy,
So...
Tell us a little bit more
About the nitty-gritty, the detail,
My brother--
The smarts behind smart rain--
Mark plowman, everybody.
Mark:
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our revolutionary technology
Begins with this specially designed,
Emission-free,
Cloud seeding drone.
(crowd applauds, whistles)
Now, when this incredible machine takes to the sky,
It's a two-stage
Patented process.
First the clouds are seeded with a special nutrient-rich formula
Mixed with the rainmaking iodine crystals.
When the smart rain finally
Falls on our genetically enhanced seeds,
Fallow fields will spring to bountiful life,
Increasing yields tenfold.
We're not just talking about
Fruit and vegetables anymore, folks.
We are on the path to feeding the world.
(cheering, whistling)
What'd you see?
Joshua:
They claim the smart rain's gonna feed the world,
But i just saw a knife cut through a plowman bag of seed
That was full of nothing but bones.
I'm worried if they launch this technology
They're gonna break another seal.
Both brothers' faces are on on those bags.
So who's the horseman, vincent or mark?
Koa:
Better figure it out fast--
They're launching this thing tomorrow.
What do we do, go after both?
Joshua:
I wish i could tell you.
Look...
If there's one thing we should learn from rose, it's to not
Blindly follow anyone.
This should be a democracy, not a dictatorship.
We all know we need to stop the horsemen.
So we should all decide what to do.
Okay.
Raul and i will see what we can get out of mark.
How about the three of us track down vincent?
Look, every generation of the messengers
Have stopped their horsemen.
If we have faith in ourselves,
And in each other...
Then, by god, so will we.
Vincent:
All right,
Enjoy yourself, party!
(applause, cheering)
(phone dings)
What the hell?
How'd i get my money back?
(brakes squeak, doors open)
Hey!
(car doors close)
Guys!
Alan?
Man (muffled):
You got him?
Man 2 (muffled):
Yeah, let's go.
(mechanical whirring, rattling)
Man 1:
Get him to smyrna right away-- we're behind schedule.
(suv engine starts)
(pneumatic hiss)
Oh, no.
This cannot be happening.

In the beginning, a star fell from Heaven and changed us.
Made us angels and gave us a new destiny:
to stop the Apocalypse and the Devil himself.
We must pass God's test and prove humanity is still worth saving.
For we are the Messengers.
Previously on The Messengers...
Your daughter's been touched with a gift of her own.
Together again, just like my drawing.
Is this all of us?
Who's that?
That's my friend Michael.
He likes soccer.
You promised me if I listened to your stories,
I'd get my son back.
Now where is Michael?
What the hell is this?
St. Monica.
The patron saint of mothers.
I saw these two boys in my vision.
I've seen them twice today, too.
It's definitely a sign.
These brothers must be connected to the next Horseman.
How is Rose any different from the rest of us?
Because Rose is the Horseman of Death.
Rest in peace, Joshua.
We can't save him, he's dead.
- He doesn't have to be.
- What do you mean?
What if I told you I can bring him back from the dead?
That if you give me what I want,
I'll resurrect your friend?
All right, dear Messengers, take a moment and ask yourselves:
What would Joshua do?
He would do anything to save one of us.
Except for make a deal with the Devil.
But Eliza said we can't defeat the Horsemen unless all seven Messengers are truly united.
We can't defeat anyone without Joshua.
No, you can't.
You need a man of vision, which means you need to share his latest vision with me, or...
I will leave him for dead.
And you can all go back to the bar and cry in your beer.
If you want to know what his visions are, then you need him alive just as much as we do.
Do I?
I'll give you till the count of ten.
- One...
- It's a mistake.
Don't listen to him.
- Two...
- What choice do we have?
- Three...
- How do we know this isn't just a lie?
- Four...
- We don't.
- Five...
- We want the same thing.
- Yeah, but for different reasons.
- Six...
Seven...
- Guys, we don't have a choice.
- Eight...
We're just gonna give the Devil what he wants?
Nine...
Joshua will be damned if we do, but we'll all be damned if we don't.
Ten... now tell me what I want to hear and don't lie to me, or there will be hell to pay.
- Plowman Family Farms.
- Damn it, Vera!
That's what Joshua saw in his last vision.
The logo with a photo of the two brothers, Mark and Vincent...
They own the company.
The headquarters is in California.
That's what we know.
Farming and Famine.
Sounds like a perfect match.
Okay, you got what you wanted.
Now bring Joshua back.
Don't rush me, boy.
Joshua.
What have you done?
So the Devil really brought me back to life?
Yeah.
And Rose really killed you?
She's the Horseman of Death.
Look, you didn't tell her anything about your visions, right?
Not about Plowman Farms or...
No.
I lied.
No one knows about the real vision but us.
And the Devil.
But at least we've got you back.
But... h-how do we know what our next move is?
I know what to do.
And as long as I'm alive...
I will not let us fail.
I did a little research.
The Plowmans are holding a public press conference the day after tomorrow and we gotta get there.
So we're gonna train hop all the way to California?
Tickets, please.
Just messing with you.
You're like a Michael Jackson video, you know that?
So we're not sitting together?
You're lucky you got seats at all.
It's not easy hustling tickets for wanted fugitives.
All aboard.
I have no doubt once you have a full grasp of Operation Genesis, you'll see that your hacking skills will come in very handy.
You're sure the Devil won't find out about this?
How would he?
He seems to have his ways.
Let's face it:
Horsemen have worked with him for six generations.
He's always been able to talk them out of the Apocalypse.
Not this time.
He just wants to hold onto his playground.
We have a purpose.
We stop in Albuquerque next, then on to California.
Should put us right in time for the event tomorrow at Plowman headquarters.
And get this:
These brothers, Mark and Vincent, they're not just farmers.
They're big players in the genetically modified seed industry.
Supposed to announce some new technology that's been kept under wraps.
I wonder if that has anything to do with breaking the next Horseman's seal.
Maybe... but let me ask you this:
What was it like?
What was what like?
To be dead.
In my culture, we believe in reincarnation.
Just not the way you did it.
So I'm curious.
Do you remember anything?
I saw a tunnel of light.
You know, the one everyone always talks about?
And I was headed right toward Heaven.
And then, suddenly, I felt an ice-cold hand on the back of my neck, yanking me back.
And it still feels like the Devil's got me tight in his grip.
I know why y'all brought me back.
But what if I go to Hell for it?
Pick a card.
Come on... this is the first card trick my father ever taught me.
Learned it when I was, like, six.
It's called "Dead Man's Hand."
Just pick one, all right?
And memorize it and put it back.
And your card is... not here.
You don't see it, do you?
Mm-mm.
That's weird.
Check your pocket.
Come on...
Your card?
It's still a good trick, though.
Wait, that never... that never happens.
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.
I know this trick like the back of my hand.
What the hell is wrong with me?
I, uh...
It's getting worse.
What is?
Um, I've been forgetting things.
Like, things that I've known all my life.
It just... it started not too long ago.
After you got your gift?
You just shape-shifted at the train station, right?
Yeah.
So?
Maybe the memory problems are the cost of your gift.
You had a vision.
What was it?
There's a storm coming.
I'm telling you, Amy has some kind of gift.
See?
Rose isn't in this.
Somehow Amy knew she wasn't a Messenger.
You just said she also drew the Devil at the Last Supper.
I mean, what are you feeding this kid?
And this...
Michael's soccer uniform...
It's the same one I saw in the video the Devil showed me.
And the "M"... it could be for Michael.
Did you ever show the video to Amy?
No.
She says it's her imaginary friend.
I mean, somehow she has to be connected to all of this, right?
Are you sure she's not a Messenger?
I mean, if she is, we haven't seen her wings.
Well, the Bible's full of characters.
Maybe Amy's got a different role to play.
How are you doing?
Honestly, not great.
I gotta get Amy away from all this.
You know?
Rose, the Devil, the things that she's seen...
And now she's drawing pictures that seem to predict the future.
I mean, I'm really worried about her.
Sucks to be a parent, huh?
Sometimes.
You ever thought about being one?
I am.
What?
What do you mean?
Gabriela told me...
That I'm Nadia's father.
Attention, passengers.
Our next stop is Albuquerque.
V, wait up!
Uh, excuse me, sorry, sorry.
V, what are you doing?
It's just a quick stop.
Oh, my God.
No way.
St. Monica, Patron Saint of Mothers.
Want to buy a cupcake?
We're raising money for our school soccer program.
Mi-Michael?
Mi...
Michael.
Oh, um... uh, yeah, chocolate, uh, please?
- Do you know this boy?
- Guys!
Brian Fairburn.
Yeah, I babysit for him all the time.
Guys, the train's about to leave!
- Can I borrow this a second?
- Sure.
I think I just found Michael.
- What are you talking about?
- Look at number three.
That boy's my son.
That-that-that's the same boy from the videos I saw.
And the same boy from Amy's drawings.
And-and look...
The medallion the Devil gave me.
St. Monica.
It's the same name as this school.
Look, we gave him what he wanted, and I think the Devil's given me a clue to find my son.
Or it could be just another one of his tricks.
But what if it isn't?
- I can't leave without knowing for sure.
- We can't give up on the mission.
It's not safe for any of us to be alone right now.
She's not alone.
- I'm staying, too.
- Vera, look at me.
I know how important this is to you.
But you cannot leave.
It's my son.
Attention, all passengers.
This is the final boarding call for the westbound train.
You need to tell Nadia as soon as we get back.
I know.
She already blames me for losing her dad.
It's like, if I tell her this, then it's like
I'm taking him away from her all over again.
No, you're not taking anything away from her.
You're just giving her the truth.
Why did you tell me?
Because the last time I wasn't honest with you, I almost lost you.
And I don't want that to happen ever again.
Do you still have feelings for Gabriela?
Nah.
I have feelings for you.
Son of a bitch!
That's that kid wanted for murder.
Peter...
Peter, wake up.
You've been made.
- Keep him here, okay?
- Yeah.
Come on!
Answer the phone.
Police Headquarters.
How may I direct your call?
Hey!
This is Deputy Landis out of Flagstaff.
Look, I'm off-duty, but I need to report a...
Sir?
Sir, are you there?
I can't take you anywhere, can I?
We gotta go.
What's going on?
Josh just had a vision.
I saw a tree with a blue tire swing.
And then rain started to fall...
Red rain... and-and everything just turned to dust.
The next seal maybe?
Well, I hate to say it, but we got other problems.
Cop just I.D.'d Peter.
We gotta get off the train.
But we need to get to the Plowman brothers.
- Change of plans.
- No.
Listen to me.
We already lost Vera and Alan.
The rest of us have to stay on point.
We can't do that behind bars.
Peter's not the only one who's a fugitive here.
- Erin's wanted, I'm wanted.
- What do we do?
Koa, cover me.
Everything's all right, folks.
Just a quick maintenance check.
We'll be back on our way in a jiffy.
No, guys, we can't do this.
We can figure it out, but we got to stick together!
Then we're screwed, Josh!
If we stay on the train, the entire mission gets derailed.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I'm good.
Look, we'll meet you at the Plowmans.
Okay?
Promise.
Who knew this trip could actually get longer?
I think the correct response to somebody who saved your ass is thank you.
Would you guys stop it?
At least, we found a road.
It's got to lead somewhere, right?
Hopefully to the next town.
We can catch a bus from there.
Yeah, according to my GPS, that's just a short 47-mile walk.
Can you look up some good news on that thing, please?
What about that?
Welcome to Farmville.
It's dry as a bone out here.
This place has seen better days.
Hey, buddy.
Why you over here by yourself?
Peter...
Guys, check it out.
Whoa.
Do you think this is the tree from Joshua's vision?
Hey, use that phone of yours and ask him.
Maybe we can sweet-talk these people into giving us a ride?
Yeah.
Well, according to Joshua, we're definitely here for a reason.
Something we can do for you folks?
Look, I-I'm sorry.
We don't mean to bother you.
We were actually just hoping you might be able to give us a ride into town.
Yeah, our car broke down a few miles back.
- Earl Cowan.
- Hi.
Sorry to hear you folks are stranded.
Tom's a pretty good mechanic.
Could, uh, tow you out and take a look.
Oh, thanks.
It's pretty bad.
Threw a rod, I think.
Engine's blown.
Really not worth the tow charges.
Yeah, we just need a ride.
Maybe to the nearest bus station?
Well, I suppose we could give you a lift.
But it's an hour into town and it's, uh, just about suppertime.
Y'all must be hungry.
Care to join us?
Yeah.
Sure.
We'd be honored.
- Come on in.
- Thanks.
Hey, V, shouldn't we, uh, at least think this through a second?
I mean, what are you gonna do?
You just gonna walk in there and take your kid back?
- You're damn right!
- Okay, but... well, shouldn't we at least call the cops first?
- Or-or-or Liam Neeson?
- Look!
I'm tired of waiting.
I want my son!
Answer the door!
Hey, hey, hey!
Take it easy!
I don't think anyone's home.
No.
No, come...
No, come...
Okay.
Ah, yeah.
Okay.
You're heavy when you're dead, you know that?
Vera!
Hey, I found a hide-a-key.
Vera!
You're scaring me.
I need to show you something.
This was his room.
Oh, Vera, I'm...
I'm sorry.
It's a model of the solar system.
He got an A-plus.
I don't get it.
Why would they just leave like this?
I don't know, Alan.
Wait.
Yes, I do.
Son of a bitch.
Alan, he told them we were coming.
The Devil's behind this.
That's why they're not here!
And after that adventure, my first time riding a horse was also my last.
Well, I'm sorry we don't have more to offer you.
That was the last of the berries.
From our very last harvest at that.
Your very last harvest?
Well, it's been a bad few seasons across the valley.
Just can't seem to shake the drought.
Even with our own irrigation system, we still haven't been able to turn things around.
Crops keep dying.
Afraid we've done all we can.
Well, we prayed and prayed for a miracle, and Tom here finally brought us one.
How so?
Well, he introduced us to those nice folks from Plowman Family Farms.
They're, uh, buying us out, like they did every other suffering farm in the valley.
Well, we didn't know what we were gonna do.
We're always the last holdout.
Plowmans cover every base.
Soil treatment, improved seed, irrigation.
They're actually about to start testing their technology on farms across the valley.
Once they do that, they'll turn this place from a dirt patch into a bumper crop, in no time.
All I got to do is sign the contracts, and then we'll be part of the Plowman family.
You'll have to excuse Earl.
Nerves a bit frazzled lately.
His great-grandfather started this farm, and it's hard for him to let it go.
But it's about damn time.
What about your first job?
No.
Your first boyfriend?
- Nothing.
- Okay.
What about the neighborhood you grew up in?
Do you remember any of that?
It used to be so clear.
It was a good day.
Now, for some reason, it just... it's all a blur.
Now I can't even remember my own father's face.
What's happening to me?
My opinion is that it has to do with your gift.
Now, hear me out.
You shape-shifted at the train station, and then you forgot the trick your father taught you.
Then you morphed into the conductor, and now these memories are gone.
So?
So... by stealing people's identities, maybe you're losing track of your own.
These gifts we've been given, they weren't just doled out at random.
Each one of them speaks to something that we need to learn about ourselves.
- You were raised a con artist, right?
- Yeah.
So your whole past is about manipulating folks.
Then maybe your future should be about helping them.
How do I know that's gonna help me?
Well, that's just it.
Being a Messenger isn't about you.
It's about everyone else.
"It's about damn time."
You're sure that's what you heard Tom thinking?
Yeah, it was weird.
I don't know... he seems like such a nice guy.
Maybe he's just frustrated over watching the farm fail.
Joshua must have had a vision of this place for a reason, right?
I mean, it's about to be taken over by the same brothers we're looking at as Horsemen.
But why?
I don't know.
But we're supposed to be here...
I'm sure of it.
Come on.
Yeah, this way, this way.
This way.
So why do you keep these two apart, anyway?
'Cause that one over there's his mother, but this one, he's gonna be a bull one day.
Might as well get used to it, right?
We'll need to hurry to town if you want to catch the last night bus.
Or you're welcome to bunk in our guest room, get a fresh start in the morning.
If it's not too much trouble, we'd love to stay.
No trouble.
Thanks.
So this is what you were telling me about.
The meteorite contains every element known to man, plus one we've never seen before.
But every time we try to extract it, let's just say it becomes very volatile.
Well, in that case, my esteemed guest and I would like to see the extraction process for ourselves.
This evening.
Madam Secretary, you don't understand.
I...
Think I understand perfectly.
I cannot continue to put my people in harm's way just so...
Doctor...
It's either your people...
Or you.
Can't sleep?
All my life, I've been a preacher.
But I was just selling my old man's snake oil.
Then I met Rose, and finally thought I had something real to believe in.
She played you, Joshua.
But you're not the only one who fell for it.
Maybe not.
But I used to lead people, Koa.
Inspire them.
Now nobody listens to me.
I couldn't even keep six of us on a train.
Maybe you weren't supposed to.
There's an old Taoist saying...
"When the best leader's work is done, the people say, 'We did it ourselves.'"
You're a good leader, Joshua.
You just need to listen to your own advice.
Yeah, what's that?
It's not about you.
It's about everyone else.
Damn, this salt is heavy.
Plowman ain't paying me enough for this crap.
Once the solution mixes with the pulverized meteor sample inside the centrifuge, the Genesis Element should be in its purest form for collection.
But each time, it resists extraction, almost like it's defending itself.
I'm begging you to reconsider.
Now, Doctor.
You heard the lady.
Do as you're told.
Initialize.
Yes, sir.
Initiated.
Now do you see?
No matter what we try, it ends in disaster.
Wrong.
It's incredible.
Isn't it?
Oh, I think we're well on our way to creating the most destructive weapon the world has ever known.
Seven years of searching, dead end after dead end, and now I've abandoned everybody who needs me to go on a wild goose chase.
No, it was a good lead...
you had to follow it.
The Devil was never gonna give me my son back, okay?
How could I have trusted him?
Vera, you are closer now than ever to finding Michael.
I need better than "closer," Alan.
I need my son.
Ow...
Alan?
Alan?
!
Alan?
!
Alan...
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
Get off of me...
What the hell did you do?
Nothing!
Did you shoot her?
No.
She pass out?
No, man, she's dead.
Are you kidding me?
We followed them all the way from Texas.
Richards wants her alive.
Just get them in the car.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Hey, bud.
You're not gonna give up, are you?
Let's go see mom.
Hope you have an appetite.
Gladys makes the best eggs and hash around.
Thank you.
- Morning, Earl.
- Morning.
Mind tasting this?
It's water from your irrigation tank.
It's salty!
You want to tell him, or should I?
Tell me what?
Who the hell you think you are?
I saw Tom pouring salt into the tank last night.
Don't listen to him, Earl.
That would kill all the crops.
Exactly.
Wh-Why would you do a thing like that?
- I didn't.
- He did.
I'm guessing he's been poisoning the water supply to make the farm fail, so you'd be forced to sell.
You been like a son to me, Tom.
You tell me the truth.
Selling's for your own good, and you know it, Earl... you do...
And you're so damn stubborn,
I was just trying to get you a fair price before you had to give the farm away.
How much of a price you get from the Plowman family for selling them out?
Gladys... call the sheriff.
Peter, stop him!
Well, I don't know how y'all did it, but you did it.
Better head out the back way.
You sure about this?
Go on, take it.
- It's the least we can do.
- Mm.
Don't worry, we'll bring your truck back after we meet up with our friends.
We aren't worried.
I told you we prayed for a miracle to save our farm and... now we know... you all were the real miracle.
I just tore up that contract from the Plowmans.
Thank you.
You ready to get back on mission?
I think that was the mission.
_
Don't worry, they'll be here.
Hey, you made it.
Yeah... 100 miles an hour, no patrolmen in sight.
Thank God.
Anyone hear from Vera and Alan?
No.
Not a word.
That's them.
That's the Plowmans.
Howdy, folks.
Plowman Family Farms is proud to present to the world... the greatest agricultural breakthrough in a century.
Tomorrow, at farms all across the drought-stricken Central Valley, we launch a cutting-edge, new rainmaking system...
One that not only seeds clouds but also fortifies them with a nutrient-rich water source we call...
Smart Rain.
The tree in your vision...
wasn't it killed by rain?
Yeah!
Now as many of you will realize, I am not exactly the science guy, so... tell us a little bit more about the nitty-gritty, the detail, my brother...
The smarts behind Smart Rain...
Mark Plowman, everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our revolutionary technology begins with this specially designed, emission-free, cloud seeding drone.
Now, when this incredible machine takes to the sky, it's a two-stage patented process.
First the clouds are seeded with a special nutrient-rich formula mixed with the rainmaking iodine crystals.
When the Smart Rain finally falls on our genetically enhanced seeds, fallow fields will spring to bountiful life, increasing yields tenfold.
We're not just talking about fruit and vegetables anymore, folks.
We are on the path to feeding the world.
What'd you see?
They claim the Smart Rain's gonna feed the world, but I just saw a knife cut through a Plowman bag of seed that was full of nothing but bones.
I'm worried if they launch this technology they're gonna break another seal.
Both brothers' faces are on on those bags.
So who's the Horseman, Vincent or Mark?
Better figure it out fast...
They're launching this thing tomorrow.
What do we do, go after both?
I wish I could tell you.
Look... if there's one thing we should learn from Rose, it's to not blindly follow anyone.
This should be a democracy, not a dictatorship.
We all know we need to stop the Horsemen.
So we should all decide what to do.
Okay.
Raul and I will see what we can get out of Mark.
How about the three of us track down Vincent?
Look, every generation of the Messengers have stopped their Horsemen.
If we have faith in ourselves, and in each other... then, by God, so will we.
All right, enjoy yourself, party!
What the hell?
How'd I get my money back?
Hey!
Guys!
Alan?
You got him?
Yeah, let's go.
Get him to Smyrna right away... we're behind schedule.
Oh, no.
This cannot be happening.
JOSHUA:
In the beginning, a star fell from Heaven and changed us.
Made us angels and gave us a new destiny:
to stop the Apocalypse and the Devil himself.
We must pass God's test and prove humanity is still worth saving.
For we are the Messengers.
Previously on The Messengers...
ELIZA:
Your daughter's been touched with a gift of her own.
AMY:
Together again, just like my drawing.
Is this all of us?
Who's that?
That's my friend Michael.
He likes soccer.
You promised me if I listened to your stories,
I'd get my son back.
Now where is Michael?
What the hell is this?
THE MAN:
St. Monica.
The patron saint of mothers.
I saw these two boys in my vision.
VERA:
I've seen them twice today, too.
It's definitely a sign.
These brothers must be connected to the next Horseman.
How is Rose any different from the rest of us?
THE MAN:
Because Rose is the Horseman of Death.
Rest in peace, Joshua.
(gasps)
We can't save him, he's dead.
- He doesn't have to be.
- What do you mean?
What if I told you I can bring him back from the dead?
That if you give me what I want,
I'll resurrect your friend?
THE MAN:
All right, dear Messengers, take a moment and ask yourselves:
What would Joshua do?
He would do anything to save one of us.
Except for make a deal with the Devil.
But Eliza said we can't defeat the Horsemen unless all seven Messengers are truly united.
We can't defeat anyone without Joshua.
No, you can't.
You need a man of vision, which means you need to share his latest vision with me, or...
I will leave him for dead.
And you can all go back to the bar and cry in your beer.
If you want to know what his visions are, then you need him alive just as much as we do.
Do I?
I'll give you till the count of ten.
- One...
- It's a mistake.
Don't listen to him.
- Two...
- What choice do we have?
- Three...
- How do we know this isn't just a lie?
- Four...
- We don't.
- Five...
- We want the same thing.
- Yeah, but for different reasons.
- Six...
Seven...
- Guys, we don't have a choice.
- Eight...
We're just gonna give the Devil what he wants?
Nine...
VERA:
Joshua will be damned if we do, but we'll all be damned if we don't.
Ten... now tell me what I want to hear and don't lie to me, or there will be hell to pay.
- Plowman Family Farms.
- Damn it, Vera!
That's what Joshua saw in his last vision.
The logo with a photo of the two brothers, Mark and Vincent...
They own the company.
The headquarters is in California.
That's what we know.
Farming and Famine.
Sounds like a perfect match.
Okay, you got what you wanted.
Now bring Joshua back.
Don't rush me, boy.
(eerie chanting)
(stops chanting)
VERA:
Joshua.
(gasping)
What have you done?
So the Devil really brought me back to life?
VERA:
Yeah.
And Rose really killed you?
She's the Horseman of Death.
Look, you didn't tell her anything about your visions, right?
Not about Plowman Farms or...
No.
I lied.
No one knows about the real vision but us.
And the Devil.
ERIN:
But at least we've got you back.
PETER:
But... h-how do we know what our next move is?
JOSHUA:
I know what to do.
And as long as I'm alive...
I will not let us fail.
(train horn blaring)
JOSHUA:
I did a little research.
The Plowmans are holding a public press conference the day after tomorrow and we gotta get there.
So we're gonna train hop all the way to California?
Tickets, please.
Just messing with you.
You're like a Michael Jackson video, you know that?
So we're not sitting together?
You're lucky you got seats at all.
It's not easy hustling tickets for wanted fugitives.
All aboard.
CINDY:
I have no doubt once you have a full grasp of Operation Genesis, you'll see that your hacking skills will come in very handy.
You're sure the Devil won't find out about this?
How would he?
He seems to have his ways.
Let's face it:
Horsemen have worked with him for six generations.
He's always been able to talk them out of the Apocalypse.
Not this time.
He just wants to hold onto his playground.
We have a purpose.
(train horn blares)
We stop in Albuquerque next, then on to California.
Should put us right in time for the event tomorrow at Plowman headquarters.
And get this:
These brothers, Mark and Vincent, they're not just farmers.
They're big players in the genetically modified seed industry.
Supposed to announce some new technology that's been kept under wraps.
I wonder if that has anything to do with breaking the next Horseman's seal.
Maybe... but let me ask you this:
What was it like?
What was what like?
To be dead.
In my culture, we believe in reincarnation.
Just not the way you did it.
So I'm curious.
Do you remember anything?
I saw a tunnel of light.
You know, the one everyone always talks about?
And I was headed right toward Heaven.
And then, suddenly, I felt an ice-cold hand on the back of my neck, yanking me back.
And it still feels like the Devil's got me tight in his grip.
I know why y'all brought me back.
But what if I go to Hell for it?
Pick a card.
Come on... this is the first card trick my father ever taught me.
Learned it when I was, like, six.
It's called "Dead Man's Hand."
Just pick one, all right?
And memorize it and put it back.
And your card is... not here.
You don't see it, do you?
Mm-mm.
That's weird.
Check your pocket.
Come on...
Your card?
It's still a good trick, though.
Wait, that never... that never happens.
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.
I know this trick like the back of my hand.
What the hell is wrong with me?
I, uh...
It's getting worse.
What is?
Um, I've been forgetting things.
Like, things that I've known all my life.
It just... it started not too long ago.
After you got your gift?
You just shape-shifted at the train station, right?
Yeah.
So?
Maybe the memory problems are the cost of your gift.
(sighs)
(gasps)
You had a vision.
What was it?
There's a storm coming.
VERA:
I'm telling you, Amy has some kind of gift.
See?
Rose isn't in this.
Somehow Amy knew she wasn't a Messenger.
You just said she also drew the Devil at the Last Supper.
I mean, what are you feeding this kid?
And this...
Michael's soccer uniform...
It's the same one I saw in the video the Devil showed me.
And the "M"... it could be for Michael.
Did you ever show the video to Amy?
No.
She says it's her imaginary friend.
I mean, somehow she has to be connected to all of this, right?
Are you sure she's not a Messenger?
I mean, if she is, we haven't seen her wings.
Well, the Bible's full of characters.
Maybe Amy's got a different role to play.
How are you doing?
Honestly, not great.
I gotta get Amy away from all this.
You know?
Rose, the Devil, the things that she's seen...
And now she's drawing pictures that seem to predict the future.
I mean, I'm really worried about her.
Sucks to be a parent, huh?
Sometimes.
You ever thought about being one?
I am.
(laughs):
What?
What do you mean?
Gabriela told me...
That I'm Nadia's father.
CONDUCTOR (over P.A.):
Attention, passengers.
Our next stop is Albuquerque.
V, wait up!
Uh, excuse me, sorry, sorry.
V, what are you doing?
It's just a quick stop.
Oh, my God.
No way.
St. Monica, Patron Saint of Mothers.
Want to buy a cupcake?
We're raising money for our school soccer program.
Mi-Michael?
Mi...
Michael.
Oh, um... uh, yeah, chocolate, uh, please?
- Do you know this boy?
- Guys!
Brian Fairburn.
Yeah, I babysit for him all the time.
Guys, the train's about to leave!
- Can I borrow this a second?
- Sure.
I think I just found Michael.
- What are you talking about?
- Look at number three.
That boy's my son.
That-that-that's the same boy from the videos I saw.
And the same boy from Amy's drawings.
And-and look...
The medallion the Devil gave me.
St. Monica.
It's the same name as this school.
Look, we gave him what he wanted, and I think the Devil's given me a clue to find my son.
Or it could be just another one of his tricks.
But what if it isn't?
- I can't leave without knowing for sure.
- We can't give up on the mission.
It's not safe for any of us to be alone right now.
She's not alone.
- I'm staying, too.
- Vera, look at me.
I know how important this is to you.
But you cannot leave.
It's my son.
(P.A. chiming)
CONDUCTOR:
Attention, all passengers.
This is the final boarding call for the westbound train.
You need to tell Nadia as soon as we get back.
I know.
She already blames me for losing her dad.
It's like, if I tell her this, then it's like
I'm taking him away from her all over again.
No, you're not taking anything away from her.
You're just giving her the truth.
Why did you tell me?
Because the last time I wasn't honest with you, I almost lost you.
And I don't want that to happen ever again.
Do you still have feelings for Gabriela?
Nah.
I have feelings for you.
MAN:
Son of a bitch!
That's that kid wanted for murder.
(quietly):
Peter...
Peter, wake up.
You've been made.
- Keep him here, okay?
- ERIN:
Yeah.
Come on!
Answer the phone.
WOMAN:
Police Headquarters.
How may I direct your call?
Hey!
This is Deputy Landis out of Flagstaff.
Look, I'm off-duty, but I need to report a... (grunting)
Sir?
Sir, are you there?
(phone beeps off)
(train horn blows)
I can't take you anywhere, can I?
We gotta go.
What's going on?
Josh just had a vision.
I saw a tree with a blue tire swing.
And then rain started to fall...
Red rain... and-and everything just turned to dust.
The next seal maybe?
Well, I hate to say it, but we got other problems.
Cop just I.D.'d Peter.
We gotta get off the train.
But we need to get to the Plowman brothers.
- Change of plans.
- No.
Listen to me.
We already lost Vera and Alan.
The rest of us have to stay on point.
We can't do that behind bars.
Peter's not the only one who's a fugitive here.
- Erin's wanted, I'm wanted.
- What do we do?
Koa, cover me.
(alarm rings)
Everything's all right, folks.
Just a quick maintenance check.
We'll be back on our way in a jiffy.
(echoing, indistinct voice; becoming clearer)
JOSHUA: no, guys, we can't do this.
We can figure it out, but we got to stick together!
Then we're screwed, Josh!
If we stay on the train, the entire mission gets derailed.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I'm good.
ERIN:
Look, we'll meet you at the Plowmans.
Okay?
Promise.
(door hisses open)
Who knew this trip could actually get longer?
I think the correct response to somebody who saved your ass is thank you.
Would you guys stop it?
At least, we found a road.
It's got to lead somewhere, right?
Hopefully to the next town.
We can catch a bus from there.
Yeah, according to my GPS, that's just a short 47-mile walk.
Can you look up some good news on that thing, please?
What about that?
RAUL:
Welcome to Farmville.
(various animals bleating and mooing in distance)
ERIN:
It's dry as a bone out here.
This place has seen better days.
(calf bellows in distance)
PETER:
Hey, buddy.
Why you over here by yourself?
RAUL:
Peter...
Guys, check it out.
Whoa.
Do you think this is the tree from Joshua's vision?
Hey, use that phone of yours and ask him.
Maybe we can sweet-talk these people into giving us a ride?
ERIN:
Yeah.
Well, according to Joshua, we're definitely here for a reason.
Something we can do for you folks?
Look, I-I'm sorry.
We don't mean to bother you.
We were actually just hoping you might be able to give us a ride into town.
Yeah, our car broke down a few miles back.
- Earl Cowan.
- Hi.
Sorry to hear you folks are stranded.
Tom's a pretty good mechanic.
Could, uh, tow you out and take a look.
Oh, thanks.
It's pretty bad.
Threw a rod, I think.
Engine's blown.
Really not worth the tow charges.
Yeah, we just need a ride.
Maybe to the nearest bus station?
Well, I suppose we could give you a lift.
But it's an hour into town and it's, uh, just about suppertime.
Y'all must be hungry.
Care to join us?
(quiet laugh)
Yeah.
Sure.
We'd be honored.
- Come on in.
- Thanks.
Hey, V, shouldn't we, uh, at least think this through a second?
I mean, what are you gonna do?
You just gonna walk in there and take your kid back?
- You're damn right!
- Okay, but... well, shouldn't we at least call the cops first?
- Or-or-or Liam Neeson?
- Look!
I'm tired of waiting.
I want my son!
(knocking on door)
Answer the door!
Hey, hey, hey!
Take it easy!
I don't think anyone's home.
No.
No, come...
No, come...
Okay.
(grunts)
Ah, yeah.
Okay.
You're heavy when you're dead, you know that?
Vera!
Hey, I found a hide-a-key.
Vera!
(Alan grunts, Vera gasps)
You're scaring me.
I need to show you something.
This was his room.
Oh, Vera, I'm...
I'm sorry.
(quiet laugh)
It's a model of the solar system.
He got an A-plus.
ALAN:
I don't get it.
Why would they just leave like this?
(sniffling):
I don't know, Alan.
VERA:
Wait.
Yes, I do.
(squeaks)
Son of a bitch.
Alan, he told them we were coming.
The Devil's behind this.
That's why they're not here!
ERIN:
And after that adventure, my first time riding a horse was also my last.
(everybody chuckles)
Well, I'm sorry we don't have more to offer you.
That was the last of the berries.
From our very last harvest at that.
Your very last harvest?
Well, it's been a bad few seasons across the valley.
Just can't seem to shake the drought.
Even with our own irrigation system, we still haven't been able to turn things around.
Crops keep dying.
Afraid we've done all we can.
Well, we prayed and prayed for a miracle, and Tom here finally brought us one.
PETER:
How so?
Well, he introduced us to those nice folks from Plowman Family Farms.
They're, uh, buying us out, like they did every other suffering farm in the valley.
GLADYS:
Well, we didn't know what we were gonna do.
We're always the last holdout.
TOM:
Plowmans cover every base.
Soil treatment, improved seed, irrigation.
They're actually about to start testing their technology on farms across the valley.
Once they do that, they'll turn this place from a dirt patch into a bumper crop, in no time.
All I got to do is sign the contracts, and then we'll be part of the Plowman family.
You'll have to excuse Earl.
Nerves a bit frazzled lately.
His great-grandfather started this farm, and it's hard for him to let it go.
TOM:
But it's about damn time.
What about your first job?
No.
Your first boyfriend?
- Nothing.
- Okay.
What about the neighborhood you grew up in?
Do you remember any of that?
KOA:
It used to be so clear.
It was a good day.
Now, for some reason, it just... it's all a blur.
Now I can't even remember my own father's face.
What's happening to me?
My opinion is that it has to do with your gift.
Now, hear me out.
You shape-shifted at the train station, and then you forgot the trick your father taught you.
Then you morphed into the conductor, and now these memories are gone.
So?
So... by stealing people's identities, maybe you're losing track of your own.
These gifts we've been given, they weren't just doled out at random.
Each one of them speaks to something that we need to learn about ourselves.
- You were raised a con artist, right?
- Yeah.
So your whole past is about manipulating folks.
Then maybe your future should be about helping them.
How do I know that's gonna help me?
Well, that's just it.
Being a Messenger isn't about you.
It's about everyone else.
ERIN: "It's about damn time."
You're sure that's what you heard Tom thinking?
Yeah, it was weird.
I don't know... he seems like such a nice guy.
Maybe he's just frustrated over watching the farm fail.
Joshua must have had a vision of this place for a reason, right?
I mean, it's about to be taken over by the same brothers we're looking at as Horsemen.
But why?
I don't know.
But we're supposed to be here...
I'm sure of it.
(grunting, bellowing)
Come on.
Yeah, this way, this way.
This way.
So why do you keep these two apart, anyway?
'Cause that one over there's his mother, but this one, he's gonna be a bull one day.
Might as well get used to it, right?
EARL:
We'll need to hurry to town if you want to catch the last night bus.
Or you're welcome to bunk in our guest room, get a fresh start in the morning.
If it's not too much trouble, we'd love to stay.
No trouble.
Thanks.
So this is what you were telling me about.
The meteorite contains every element known to man, plus one we've never seen before.
But every time we try to extract it, let's just say it becomes very volatile.
Well, in that case, my esteemed guest and I would like to see the extraction process for ourselves.
This evening.
Madam Secretary, you don't understand.
I...
Think I understand perfectly.
I cannot continue to put my people in harm's way just so...
Doctor...
It's either your people...
Or you.
Can't sleep?
All my life, I've been a preacher.
But I was just selling my old man's snake oil.
Then I met Rose, and finally thought I had something real to believe in.
She played you, Joshua.
But you're not the only one who fell for it.
Maybe not.
But I used to lead people, Koa.
Inspire them.
Now nobody listens to me.
I couldn't even keep six of us on a train.
Maybe you weren't supposed to.
There's an old Taoist saying...
"When the best leader's work is done, the people say, 'We did it ourselves.'"
You're a good leader, Joshua.
You just need to listen to your own advice.
Yeah, what's that?
It's not about you.
It's about everyone else.
TOM:
Damn, this salt is heavy.
Plowman ain't paying me enough for this crap.
(indistinct radio communication)
SIMON:
Once the solution mixes with the pulverized meteor sample inside the centrifuge, the Genesis Element should be in its purest form for collection.
But each time, it resists extraction, almost like it's defending itself.
I'm begging you to reconsider.
Now, Doctor.
You heard the lady.
Do as you're told.
Initialize.
Yes, sir.
TECHNICIANS (over radio):
Initiated.
(technician screams)
Now do you see?
No matter what we try, it ends in disaster.
Wrong.
It's incredible.
Isn't it?
Oh, I think we're well on our way to creating the most destructive weapon the world has ever known.
Seven years of searching, dead end after dead end, and now I've abandoned everybody who needs me to go on a wild goose chase.
No, it was a good lead...
you had to follow it.
The Devil was never gonna give me my son back, okay?
How could I have trusted him?
Vera, you are closer now than ever to finding Michael.
I need better than "closer," Alan.
I need my son.
(tranquilizer gun fires)
(gasps):
Ow...
Alan?
Alan?
!
Alan?
!
Alan...
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
Get off of me...
What the hell did you do?
Nothing!
Did you shoot her?
No.
She pass out?
No, man, she's dead.
Are you kidding me?
We followed them all the way from Texas.
Richards wants her alive.
(engine revving, tires screeching)
Just get them in the car.
Let's get the hell out of here.
(engine revving, tires screeching)
(gasps)
(calf bleating, grunting)
(mooing)
Hey, bud.
(bellows)
You're not gonna give up, are you?
(bellows)
(bellows, grunts)
Let's go see mom. (calf bellowing)
(mooing)
(calf bleats)
Hope you have an appetite.
Gladys makes the best eggs and hash around.
(Gladys laughs quietly)
Thank you.
- Morning, Earl.
- Morning.
Mind tasting this?
It's water from your irrigation tank.
(spits)
It's salty!
You want to tell him, or should I?
Tell me what?
Who the hell you think you are?
I saw Tom pouring salt into the tank last night.
Don't listen to him, Earl.
That would kill all the crops.
Exactly.
Wh-Why would you do a thing like that?
- I didn't.
- He did.
I'm guessing he's been poisoning the water supply to make the farm fail, so you'd be forced to sell.
You been like a son to me, Tom.
You tell me the truth.
(exhales)
Selling's for your own good, and you know it, Earl... you do...
And you're so damn stubborn,
I was just trying to get you a fair price before you had to give the farm away.
How much of a price you get from the Plowman family for selling them out?
Gladys... call the sheriff.
(door shuts, engine starts)
Peter, stop him!
(metal groaning, clanking, creaking)
EARL:
Well, I don't know how y'all did it, but you did it.
Better head out the back way.
You sure about this?
Go on, take it.
- It's the least we can do.
- Mm.
Don't worry, we'll bring your truck back after we meet up with our friends.
We aren't worried.
I told you we prayed for a miracle to save our farm and... now we know... you all were the real miracle.
EARL:
I just tore up that contract from the Plowmans.
Thank you.
You ready to get back on mission?
I think that was the mission.
(engine starts)
_
Don't worry, they'll be here.
Hey, you made it.
Yeah... 100 miles an hour, no patrolmen in sight.
Thank God.
Anyone hear from Vera and Alan?
No.
Not a word.
(crowd applauds, cheers)
That's them.
That's the Plowmans.
Howdy, folks.
Plowman Family Farms is proud to present to the world... the greatest agricultural breakthrough in a century.
Tomorrow, at farms all across the drought-stricken Central Valley, we launch a cutting-edge, new rainmaking system...
One that not only seeds clouds but also fortifies them with a nutrient-rich water source we call...
Smart Rain.
The tree in your vision...
wasn't it killed by rain?
WOMAN:
Yeah!
VINCENT:
Now as many of you will realize, I am not exactly the science guy, so... tell us a little bit more about the nitty-gritty, the detail, my brother...
The smarts behind Smart Rain...
Mark Plowman, everybody.
MARK:
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our revolutionary technology begins with this specially designed, emission-free, cloud seeding drone.
(crowd applauds, whistles)
Now, when this incredible machine takes to the sky, it's a two-stage patented process.
First the clouds are seeded with a special nutrient-rich formula mixed with the rainmaking iodine crystals.
When the Smart Rain finally falls on our genetically enhanced seeds, fallow fields will spring to bountiful life, increasing yields tenfold.
We're not just talking about fruit and vegetables anymore, folks.
We are on the path to feeding the world.
(cheering, whistling)
What'd you see?
JOSHUA:
They claim the Smart Rain's gonna feed the world, but I just saw a knife cut through a Plowman bag of seed that was full of nothing but bones.
I'm worried if they launch this technology they're gonna break another seal.
Both brothers' faces are on on those bags.
So who's the Horseman, Vincent or Mark?
KOA:
Better figure it out fast...
They're launching this thing tomorrow.
What do we do, go after both?
JOSHUA:
I wish I could tell you.
Look... if there's one thing we should learn from Rose, it's to not blindly follow anyone.
This should be a democracy, not a dictatorship.
We all know we need to stop the Horsemen.
So we should all decide what to do.
Okay.
Raul and I will see what we can get out of Mark.
How about the three of us track down Vincent?
Look, every generation of the Messengers have stopped their Horsemen.
If we have faith in ourselves, and in each other... then, by God, so will we.
VINCENT:
Allright, enjoy yourself, party!
(applause, cheering)
(phone dings)
What the hell?
How'd I get my money back?
(brakes squeak, doors open)
Hey!
(car doors close)
Guys!
Alan?
MAN (muffled):
You got him?
MAN 2 (muffled):
Yeah, let's go.
(mechanical whirring, rattling)
MAN 1:
Get him to Smyrna right away...
we're behind schedule. (SUV engine starts)
(pneumatic hiss)
Oh, no.
This cannot be happening.
Anybody there?
Hello?
Ah, shut that off.
No!
No!
No!
Can you see it?
What am I looking at?
Our future.
Plans for a new containment system.
A milk bath, Arthur.
More advanced than the one that held us during Precrime.
This file's ten years old.
Because the program was abolished before they could move us into it.
- "They"?
- The feds.
Defense Intelligence Agency.
They had bigger things in mind for us than just stopping local murders in D.C.
Like National Security?
We were going to be their secret weapon.
But the project was halted when they set us free.
So that's a good thing.
Only if it stays that way.
This is what I've been seeing in my vision, Arthur, every day since Dash went back to the city and started working with that cop.
You asked me to stop helping them and I did.
That isn't enough.
- What do you think I am?
- A realist.
Unlike your brother.
She will betray us, Arthur.
You don't know that.
I see it.
What I see is ancient history.
Yes.
But when we're too blind to learn its lessons, history repeats.
Knew I'd regret giving you your own key, Mom.
Yeah, you probably should've thought that one through.
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.
Made your favorite.
Algae and palm frittata.
I can't.
Blake's giving a tour to some bigwig fed today.
- Wants everyone at the precinct early.
- Oh.
Maybe we could plan a little get-together for tonight.
You know, something simple.
Just friends and family?
I-I probably have to work late.
I love you.
You plan on going the whole day avoiding this.
If people will let me.
Happy birthday.
Where am I gonna put those?
In water.
With protein, I'm told.
I'm a cop, Dash.
Would you give flowers to Blake?
Well, I don't know him very well.
When is his birthday?
It's just I'm not, I'm not big on birthdays.
What?
I love them.
Of course, I've only really had ten while technically conscious.
They're very nice.
Thank you.
Hey, Vega.
Your prom night?
You want to eat them?
Yeah.
I won't make that mistake again.
It's not your fault.
Vega and her dad share the same birthday.
Standing ten feet away.
Not in Boston.
Well, he should know why you're being a bitch.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
She's right.
It's been 17 years and sometimes it feels like it was just yesterday.
They never caught the guy who did it.
"17 years."
Think Precrime would've been up and running in eight months.
You would've seen it.
What?
Well, Precrime didn't start until September of '48 officially, but they had the three of us in secret testing a year before that.
For a year?
Narcissist incoming.
Detective Vega?
Henry Blomfeld, Deputy Director of the D.I.A.
Nice to meet you.
Her Hawk-Eye analyst, Dash.
Vega?
- Walk with us?
- Oh, it's okay.
Aw, you really should.
I'm fascinating company.
And I'm Akeela.
Pleasure.
Uh... uh-oh.
I was just telling your lieutenant how impressed I was with Hawk-Eye's numbers this month.
He tells me you're partly responsible.
Thank you.
But Lieutenant Blake is just being modest.
It's all him... and Hawk-Eye.
I don't think so.
You've got a clearance rate four times higher than average.
And all on Class One homicides.
You should take the victory lap, Detective.
You've earned it.
Mr. Blomfeld has invited us both to, uh, come by the agency this afternoon.
I told him we'd be honored.
Vega?
Thanks for the invitation, but you're the politician, Will.
I'll stick to catching the bad guys.
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Director.
You as well, Detective.
Play it back.
Frame by frame.
What's that ticking sound?
Is that a clock?
It's all I could hear before the scream.
Okay, so it looks like the murder happens indoors.
I can't tell if it's day or night.
Two gunshots.
Messy, not calculated.
This happens in the moment.
No faces, no identifiable markings.
Hold it.
What is it?
It's a 2019 Red Clouds jersey.
It's the year that they changed their name.
It's almost impossible to get.
Believe me, I've tried.
Well, if it's rare, maybe we can get Akeela to run the purchase records.
Wally, one more thing.
Dash said he was in the milk bath a year before they started Precrime.
Beta testing.
Working out the kinks.
We were instructed to record everything the Precogs saw, matching up their future visions to the deaths that followed.
But we weren't legally able to act yet.
Worst year of my life.
Mine, too.
Why?
What happened?
- Oh, Vega...
- If someone was murdered that year, and they didn't catch the killer, are those visions recorded somewhere?
Maybe, but-but I doubt it.
After Precrime ended, the feds pretty much stripped everything, covering their asses.
I can ask one of my old buddies, though, if you want me to poke around.
No, it was a long shot.
Thanks, Wally.
Oh, thank God.
Blake made me walk that stick-up-his-ass fed through Hawk-Eye's protocols.
All 49 of them.
I need some action.
Then you're in luck.
We need you to run a purchase.
Hit me.
Vintage 2019 Red Clouds jersey.
Very funny, Vega.
Am I missing something?
Yes, the whole concept of a birthday surprise.
Which I guess is impossible now that you're working with a... a Precog.
I knew you'd been eyeing one, so I got it for your birthday.
You like?
Vega, you're the victim.
Victim?
Is anyone angry at you?
Someone who might be holding a grudge?
Well, I was dismissive of my partner after he gave me flowers.
He might be insulted.
This isn't funny, Vega.
I'm a homicide cop.
The line of people pissed at me starts on the left.
Relax, they made 500 of those jerseys.
So?
So we didn't see my face in the murder vision.
Which means, at worst, I have a one in 500 chance of being murdered in the next few days.
Well, don't pursue this and it's almost zero.
Dash, we're gonna stop this one just like we stopped the others.
I'm gonna go see Arthur.
In the meantime, burn that jersey.
What do you know?
Apparently someone doesn't want Vega to see her next birthday.
I'm not in the mood for glib today.
And I wasn't in the market for a fat lip.
Why didn't you call me when you got Vega's name?
Because of Agatha?
Because she saw a milk bath in her vision?
Because she found one.
The feds had plans for us when Precrime ended.
Maybe still do.
They set us free.
Minds change.
And hearts.
Even if that's true, nobody knows where we are.
Except Vega.
I didn't get another name.
Laura Vega...
That's all I know.
If you're lying to me...
You can always punch me in the face again.
I can't believe I bought you that jersey.
Forget about it.
Look, I was thinking...
I got you a death shirt for your birthday.
I'm the worst friend ever.
Akeela... any details from the murder vision?
Did anything pop?
I don't know.
Maybe.
What about these arrows?
That's the logo for Revive.
It's a program based out of Hayward Correctional Facility, headed up by Dana Winter.
They specialize in inmate rehabilitation.
Well, I'm guessing the rehab didn't take.
Okay, how long will it take you to pull up the files on the prisoners?
I was gonna grab some lunch.
Well, okay.
Let's see if anyone here has had Lara Vega as their arresting officer.
Oop!
Got a bite.
Michael Wynn.
Sprawl gang leader.
He was into selling Clarity.
And women.
Didn't much like being arrested by one.
- You need to piss off.
- You need to get...
Oh, I don't think so, little lady.
Ah!
Ah!
You're dead!
You hear me, you little...
Let's start there.
You really think Wynn could be the guy?
Y-You busted him almost six years ago.
Psychos have good memories and this one used to send me death threats every Christmas.
But he's in prison.
How does he get out to hurt you?
People on the inside have a lot of reach.
Anyway, that's what we're gonna find out.
Yeah, but see... what if that's just it?
What if going to see Wynn is what gets you killed?
This isn't one of our normal cases, Vega.
This is you.
Cops deal in life or death every day.
Occupational hazard.
I know that better than anyone.
Listen...
I've been probing my brain.
Trying to access that part of my memory, to just remember something.
Anything.
I don't.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
But this would be.
You would be.
I should do this alone.
Wynn is unarmed, in a room full of guards.
Besides, I took him down once.
I can do it again.
If I'm late for work again, you're gonna have to call my boss... for the last hour with my food.
I better get a refund.
I am not paying for cold moo sh... 60 years ago, companies outsourced all this stuff abroad.
Killed the working class, causing incarceration rates to skyrocket.
Now, we give the working class their jobs back, only this time, behind bars, for two cents on the dollar.
Doesn't seem right.
I'll save my crocodile tears for the victims and their families.
We don't forget the victims, Detective.
These are our reminders of past victims, past crimes... life-changing mistakes.
It also helps them move on to more productive lives.
Because all it takes is an arts and crafts project.
I know you have history with Michael Wynn and I'll admit, he's not an easy case.
But he is trying.
We believe he may be about to commit a serious crime.
According to data patterns in our Hawk-Eye system.
Right.
According to data patterns in the Hawk-Eye system.
That's impossible.
Michael is closely surveilled, like all our inmates, especially on our excursions.
You let them outside?
Well, it's good to know I'm busting my ass sending criminals to sleep away camp.
We go on weekly outings to restaurants, parks, museums.
Tomorrow, in fact.
That must be how he gets to you.
Shall we?
Detective Vega.
Heard you might be stopping by for a visit.
- I'm touched.
- Don't be.
Who's he?
New partner?
Oh, I'm jealous.
We're here on business.
Well, I thought you just missed me.
I do.
Especially your Christmas greetings.
Decided to give that up.
Changed man, Detective.
Really?
'Cause something tells me I've been on your mind.
Not really.
Sometimes, late at night,
- when I'm...
- Go ahead.
Finish the sentence.
See if the feeling's mutual.
- So you're here to flirt.
- And reminisce.
About the night I took you down.
Remember that?
Your face in the pavement.
My knee in your chest.
Good times.
You're digging up ancient history.
Do your boys here know about our history?
That you got beat up by a former high school cheerleader?
Hmm.
People here just care about the present, Detective.
The here and now.
Is that why you want revenge?
Put a hit out on me to get back the respect of your friends inside?
I keep the past where it belongs.
Are you finished here, Detective?
Chow time.
Stick around.
I got all the time in the world.
It was nice catching up.
Good job.
Housebroken.
Like a poodle.
Vega, watch out!
Guards!
That's two out of three.
Want to go best out of seven?
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
She set me up.
She set me up!
Vega, this isn't over!
You hear me...?
You baited him.
He attacked me, Ms. Winter.
And from the looks of it, he lost his field trip privileges.
Who put this here?
I don't know.
Prisoners are allowed to put things here anonymously.
It... could have been anyone over the past ten years.
Vega, what is it?
- Excuse me, please.
- What's wrong?
You got Wynn.
They won't let him go on any more excursions...
It's over, right?
Wynn's not the killer.
What?
How do you know that?
Because I think I know why I get killed.
It's not Wynn.
This watch...
It was my dad's.
He was wearing it when he was murdered 17 years ago, but it was never recovered.
The ticking sound from my vision.
Exactly.
It must all be connected.
Yeah, but connected how?
Trying to find the guy who killed my dad is gonna get me killed.
Maybe he's in this place.
Or was.
We should get Akeela to run the names of prisoners and alumni.
Yes, but there might be something better than names.
Like faces.
Back so soon?
Recordings of Beta Precrime visions.
You said that you could poke around.
I need access to them.
If they did exist, where would they be?
I told you, the feds mopped up when Precrime fell.
Maybe FBI, maybe D.I.A...
Wait-wait, D.I.A.?
Defense Intelligence.
Blake.
He has a meeting there, some deputy director.
If they still have recordings of my father's murder,
I could catch his killer.
Wait, no.
You said yourself that looking for your father's killer might be what gets you killed.
Yeah, and if it helps me catch the guy, then it's worth the risk.
What if it's not just you?
At risk?
He's right.
The public never heard of Beta Precrime.
If you go asking questions, someone's gonna wonder how you know.
Do you trust me?
Then trust me.
What happened to letting Lieutenant Blake handle the politics, Detective?
I'm learning to multitask, Mr. Director.
Besides, this place fascinates me.
So much history.
If only you could talk about it.
Well, you should come work for us one day.
Then you could be part of creating your own history that you can't talk about.
Watch it.
Please, sit down.
Much as I would like this to be a social call, my reason for asking you here is a serious one.
I can't give you too many details, but there's intelligence that suggests a terrorist attack is imminent.
Foreign?
Domestic?
What we know for certain is the group is decentralized.
We think it could be the same people who bombed the N.I.H. Took down the Monument.
But no group was ever pinned for that attack.
Not officially.
But two words
"memento mori."
Latin.
Yeah.
For "remember you will die."
Oh, they sound friendly.
You think Hawk-Eye can help?
Well, it seems to be the best we have these days.
Computers are the most accurate predictors of future threats that we have left.
Since Precrime.
You said it.
But of course, we wasted that.
On what?
Stopping murders?
No, by missing the bigger picture.
For six years, the three Precognitives saw every murder in D.C. before it happened.
When it turned out the system wasn't foolproof, we gave up.
The next year, 4,000 people died in the bombing on the Mall.
And they would've seen it.
If we'd been smart enough to keep them.
Instead, we set them free.
And no one knows where they are now?
Sir...
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to cut this short.
- Something's come up.
- Of course.
You said six years?
That's how long the Precrime program ran.
Officially.
I heard rumors there was beta testing at least a year before the public knew.
They were seeing murders that no one ever tried to stop.
Uh, Vega, the man is busy.
Walk out with me.
The existence of Beta Precrime was top secret, Detective.
If the public found out that the federal government had been predicting murders that they never stopped...
There'd be a scandal.
Understandably.
Which no one wants.
And what is it you want?
Justice.
While the D.I.A. was testing Precrime's accuracy, no one was ever prosecuted for the murders the Precogs saw.
If those visions are still archived somewhere,
Metro can change that.
Cold cases.
My father was murdered that year.
Vega...
Oh, it's okay, Lieutenant.
We all got into this business for a reason.
I wish I could help, Detective.
But the Precrime vision archives were destroyed when the Supreme Court ruled the program unconstitutional.
These days, the murder visions only exist in one place.
Where?
Inside the Precogs' heads.
But good luck finding one.
The vision is still in my head?
And according to Blomfeld, all other records have been destroyed.
I'm sorry, but it's been too long.
If I still had that memory,
I would remember it.
Right, Wally?
Not necessarily.
What?
Over time, connections break down in the inferior temporal cortex and we lose the ability to access our memories.
- We forget.
- Correct.
However, some trace of the memory still exists as a pattern of neural connections deep in the hippocampus.
Exposed to the right stimulus, those neurons light up.
- The right stimulus?
- Through BIMR.
Brain Imaging Memory Recall.
"Beemer" for short.
It takes a specialized piece of equipment to scan those memories.
And could we find one of those machines around?
Yes.
Where?
Under the stairs.
I offered to take it off the program's hands early in the trial process, so they never had a chance to destroy it.
Wally, if you knew you could access my old visions, why didn't you tell us?
You didn't tell me Vega's father was the victim.
Besides, there's some, uh...
discomfort involved.
Well, it can't be worse than what Dash has been through already.
There are ways.
- Forget it then.
- No.
Let's just do it.
But that's not the hard part.
Your visions from the days of Precrime were formed as part of a symbiotic neural link with your twin brother.
Each brain was just one half of the whole.
That means we can't even access those memories without...
Arthur.
Yes.
And visual stimulation...
Pictures, home video from you, Vega, of your father.
I can get those easy.
But I can't get Arthur.
He won't help us.
Sure, he will.
As long as the price is right.
No, not this time.
Why?
What's different?
♪ You've got those loud bitches ♪
♪ Loud bitches telling you lies ♪
♪ Don't listen to those girls ♪
♪ They're just snakes in disguise ♪
♪ You've got the truth coming to you ♪
♪ Got to step up your game if you want to run with me ♪
♪ Should have been dead by 18 ♪
♪ Oh, mercy me, I landed back on my feet... ♪
Careful.
He cheats.
I'm certain the guy on your left is wanted by Interpol.
Please don't arrest him.
Why?
He has all the chips.
Not for long.
What's this about?
Agatha's wrong, Arthur.
My brother would make a lousy spy.
He knows me.
He knows I couldn't betray him like that.
Then that settles it.
I'll stake my life and freedom based on my brother's gut.
I'm gonna need you to.
Because I can't find the person who killed my father without your help.
Your father?
It happened before Precrime started, when you three were still in training.
Sorry to hear that.
You guys never knew your father.
Terrific role model.
Dumped my mom before we were born.
Well, mine was a good cop and even better father.
He was home every night even though he worked double shifts.
The day he died, I hurt him.
I know I did.
Families fight.
I've heard.
And what makes you so warm and fuzzy anyway?
Are you really asking me that?
Ten years in a milk bath, I know.
But it's not like your brother had it any easier.
I've seen things he hasn't.
I would never do anything to hurt Dash.
Or any of you.
I think you know that.
What does your gut say?
That you have a good chance of ending up dead very soon.
Cash me out.
Only because it's your damn birthday.
Arthur, you remember Wally.
Arthur.
So good to see you.
You're the guy who used to do my nails.
Knock it off.
Let's just do this.
It's, uh, an optogenic-based brain-imaging memory recall device.
It looks for ion channel...
Try it again.
Like I'm six.
Strap you both into that thing and mine your brain for the vision.
Mine, like dig?
Sure, why not?
Coming?
Thank you.
Anytime.
Never again.
You two always worked more smoothly with a little lubricant...
Dopamine, opioids.
Vodka's the best I got.
What, no tonic?
You'll also need these... if you've grown attached to your teeth.
Here comes the pinch.
What we're looking for are patterns...
Specific neural circuits in their brains that code for memories of your dad.
That's why we show them pictures, home movies, recordings of his voice.
I, Hamilton Vega take thee, Lily Vega to be my lawfully wedded wife.
Three, two, one, blow!
Come on, put the camera down.
Come on, let's cut the cake.
They're not responding yet.
How much longer can they take this?
I don't know.
Their memories are-are so degraded, they're not remembering your dad.
He used to whistle this to me.
Hang on, I'm getting something.
It's the whistling.
It's-it's sparking something, an old vision.
Are you sure you want to see this?
Yes.
Oh, my God.
From everything I found, Dina Winter is a saint.
ALU Person of the Year, Luxor genius grant.
You sure she's your guy?
She killed my father in cold blood.
I saw her do it, we both did.
Well, they didn't have a history that I can see.
She was into drugs, though.
Her earlier years.
I count three possession charges the same year your father died.
What about this guy?
Any facial matches?
What do we know about him?
Just that he'd make a terrible eyewitness.
Can you swipe that off, please?
Sorry.
She just doesn't seem like the same person.
People will surprise you.
So how do we bring her down?
I confront her.
Record the whole thing with my lenses, get her to confess.
And if that doesn't work?
You saw a vision of her shooting me too, right?
If I can't nail her for my father's murder,
- I'll get her for attempting mine.
- No.
No way.
It's too dangerous.
I won't let you.
It's the only way.
She saw me take my father's watch.
She could run, she could get away.
You could die.
I think you should do it.
She needs to do it.
I love that you care, and I'm thankful for what you and your brother did for me, but this is something I've been living with for a long time.
I need to do this, Dash.
Then I need to come with you.
Lara?
Hi.
Hey.
Where are you going?
I was just headed out.
Rico, go.
Uh, Mom, I really have somewhere to go.
I'm not just leaving to leave.
I still miss him, too, baby.
You ever think about the person who did it?
For years...
I used to fanaticize about everything I would do to them.
How much I would give to spread the hurt.
To make them feel it, too.
But you got over it?
Let's just say that I'm happy
I never found them.
I got to go.
They're chocolate.
Dulce de leche frosting...
Your favorite.
Save me one.
You don't have to do this.
If you think that, you don't understand.
I was embarrassed when my father wore his uniform and dropped me off at school that day.
I told him to drop me around the block.
And I'd just walk.
That's not a good enough reason to get yourself killed.
Don't worry.
I ditched the jersey.
We can change the future, right?
Sometimes it's the past that's harder to escape.
Vega?
Don't lose yourself in there.
Detective Vega.
Kind of late to be making house calls.
I'm pretty sure you recognize this.
Um, I'm not sure what you mean.
Isn't that the watch you took from my clinic this morning?
No, it's the watch you took off my father's body after you killed him.
You're recording this, I assume?
With one of those nifty A.R. devices?
I work with criminals, remember?
You are a criminal.
You're a murderer.
The-the person who... murdered your father was a junkie.
Someone who couldn't see past her next fix.
Stop pretending like you're talking about someone else.
And one stupid night, when she was so hopped up on heroin she couldn't see straight, she...
did something terrible.
Something she could never take back...
You're talking about yourself!
Calm down, Vega.
Be careful.
That junkie...
It was you, admit it!
Vega!
It was you.
That night weighs on her...
still.
And... no amount of good she's done has ever made it right.
But... she kept trying.
Keeps trying.
You got to turn your life around.
Because you got to have one.
You got to live.
He didn't.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Say it was you.
Please...
I-I have a family.
A son...
I've changed.
I'm not that junkie in the alley anymore.
You expect me to buy that?
!
You would shoot me right now if you had the chance.
Where's your gun?
I have one for protection, but, uh...
Not another step!
Where's your gun?
!
The only person with a gun here is you!
You can't know how sorry I am.
It was the worst mistake I'll ever make.
Saying yes.
"Saying... yes"?
To the job.
You were hired?
Vega, look in the mirror!
Uh, are you okay, Mom?
Bradford, put down my gun!
Bradford... that's your name?
I'm Detective Vega.
Don't move!
Vega, look at his shirt.
Maybe you weren't the victim in my vision.
He was!
Bradford.
How about this?
How about I put my gun down first?
Okay?
- Okay...
- Stay back!
Bradford, a long time ago, your mom... did something she can't take back.
I won't make the same mistake.
You shouldn't, either.
This isn't the way.
Listen to her, honey.
Okay.
You're okay.
- You're okay.
- Are you okay?
!
Yeah.
Please, he-he didn't mean to...
Go upstairs, baby.
Before... you said someone hired you to kill my dad.
Who?
Lycon.
He was my dealer.
Some guys came to him.
Said to make it look like a mugging.
Which guys?
Who were they?
I don't know.
I never met them face to face.
But I will tell you everything I know.
Just... keep my son out of this.
Please?
Let this end with us.
An eyeless man?
Lycon, a longtime dope peddler in the Sprawl back when Deena was a junkie.
He might be the go-between for whoever hired her to kill my father.
No one's heard from him in years, but we figured with your connections...
If this is all you have to go on, it's pretty thin.
I'll look into it on my end.
Thank you, Arthur.
For this and for before.
I don't expect a thank you from you.
But an apology for slugging me in the mouth would be nice.
Why?
You deserved it.
Okay, then.
But next time?
I hit you back.
You know your way out.
I just need a little more time.
You know I'll help you with this Lycon thing.
Whatever you need.
Thanks.
But right now, I need to go home.
Vega?
When you get home, grab the chair.
Mom?
Happy birthday.
It's over.
Anybody there?
Hello?
Ah, shut that off.
No!
Can you see it?
What am I looking at?
Our future.
Plans for a new containment system.
A milk bath, Arthur.
More advanced than the one that held us during Precrime.
This file's ten years old.
Because the program was abolished before they could move us into it.
- "They"?
- The feds.
Defense Intelligence Agency.
They had bigger things in mind for us than just stopping local murders in D.C.
Like National Security?
We were going to be their secret weapon.
But the project was halted when they set us free.
So that's a good thing.
Only if it stays that way.
This is what I've been seeing in my vision, Arthur, every day since Dash went back to the city and started working with that cop.
You asked me to stop helping them and I did.
That isn't enough.
- What do you think I am?
- A realist.
Unlike your brother.
She will betray us, Arthur.
You don't know that.
I see it.
What I see is ancient history.
Yes.
But when we're too blind to learn its lessons, history repeats.
Knew I'd regret giving you your own key, Mom.
Yeah, you probably should've thought that one through.
Thanks.
Made your favorite.
Algae and palm frittata.
I can't.
Blake's giving a tour to some bigwig fed today.
Wants everyone at the precinct early.
Maybe we could plan a little get-together for tonight.
You know, something simple.
Just friends and family?
I-I probably have to work late.
I love you.
You plan on going the whole day avoiding this.
If people will let me.
Happy birthday.
Where am I gonna put those?
In water.
With protein, I'm told.
I'm a cop, Dash.
Would you give flowers to Blake?
Well, I don't know him very well.
When is his birthday?
It's just I'm not, I'm not big on birthdays.
What?
I love them.
Of course, I've only really had ten while technically conscious.
They're very nice.
Thank you.
Hey, Vega.
Your prom night?
You want to eat them?
Yeah.
I won't make that mistake again.
It's not your fault.
Vega and her dad share the same birthday.
Standing ten feet away.
Not in Boston.
Well, he should know why you're being a bitch.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
She's right.
It's been 17 years and sometimes it feels like it was just yesterday.
They never caught the guy who did it.
"17 years."
Think Precrime would've been up and running in eight months.
You would've seen it.
What?
Well, Precrime didn't start until September of '48 officially, but they had the three of us in secret testing a year before that.
For a year?
Narcissist incoming.
Detective Vega?
Henry Blomfeld, Deputy Director of the D.I.A.
Nice to meet you.
Her Hawk-Eye analyst, Dash.
Vega?
- Walk with us?
- Oh, it's okay.
Aw, you really should.
I'm fascinating company.
And I'm Akeela.
Pleasure.
I was just telling your lieutenant how impressed I was with Hawk-Eye's numbers this month.
He tells me you're partly responsible.
Thank you.
But Lieutenant Blake is just being modest.
It's all him... and Hawk-Eye.
I don't think so.
You've got a clearance rate four times higher than average.
And all on Class One homicides.
You should take the victory lap, Detective.
You've earned it.
Mr. Blomfeld has invited us both to, come by the agency this afternoon.
I told him we'd be honored.
Vega?
Thanks for the invitation, but you're the politician, Will.
I'll stick to catching the bad guys.
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Director.
You as well, Detective.
Play it back.
Frame by frame.
What's that ticking sound?
Is that a clock?
It's all I could hear before the scream.
Okay, so it looks like the murder happens indoors.
I can't tell if it's day or night.
Two gunshots.
Messy, not calculated.
This happens in the moment.
No faces, no identifiable markings.
Hold it.
What is it?
It's a 2019 Red Clouds jersey.
It's the year that they changed their name.
It's almost impossible to get.
Believe me, I've tried.
Well, if it's rare, maybe we can get Akeela to run the purchase records.
Wally, one more thing.
Dash said he was in the milk bath a year before they started Precrime.
Beta testing.
Working out the kinks.
We were instructed to record everything the Precogs saw, matching up their future visions to the deaths that followed.
But we weren't legally able to act yet.
Worst year of my life.
Mine, too.
Why?
What happened?
- Oh, Vega...
- If someone was murdered that year, and they didn't catch the killer, are those visions recorded somewhere?
Maybe, but-but I doubt it.
After Precrime ended, the feds pretty much stripped everything, covering their asses.
I can ask one of my old buddies, though, if you want me to poke around.
No, it was a long shot.
Thanks, Wally.
Oh, thank God.
Blake made me walk that stick-up-his-ass fed through Hawk-Eye's protocols.
All 49 of them.
I need some action.
Then you're in luck.
We need you to run a purchase.
Hit me.
Vintage 2019 Red Clouds jersey.
Very funny, Vega.
Am I missing something?
Yes, the whole concept of a birthday surprise.
Which I guess is impossible now that you're working with a... a Precog.
I knew you'd been eyeing one, so I got it for your birthday.
You like?
Vega, you're the victim.
Victim?
Is anyone angry at you?
Someone who might be holding a grudge?
Well, I was dismissive of my partner after he gave me flowers.
He might be insulted.
This isn't funny, Vega.
I'm a homicide cop.
The line of people pissed at me starts on the left.
Relax, they made 500 of those jerseys.
So?
So we didn't see my face in the murder vision.
Which means, at worst, I have a one in 500 chance of being murdered in the next few days.
Well, don't pursue this and it's almost zero.
Dash, we're gonna stop this one just like we stopped the others.
I'm gonna go see Arthur.
In the meantime, burn that jersey.
What do you know?
Apparently someone doesn't want Vega to see her next birthday.
I'm not in the mood for glib today.
And I wasn't in the market for a fat lip.
Why didn't you call me when you got Vega's name?
Because of Agatha?
Because she saw a milk bath in her vision?
Because she found one.
The feds had plans for us when Precrime ended.
Maybe still do.
They set us free.
Minds change.
And hearts.
Even if that's true, nobody knows where we are.
Except Vega.
I didn't get another name.
Laura Vega...
That's all I know.
If you're lying to me...
You can always punch me in the face again.
I can't believe I bought you that jersey.
Forget about it.
Look, I was thinking...
I got you a death shirt for your birthday.
I'm the worst friend ever.
Akeela... any details from the murder vision?
Did anything pop?
I don't know.
Maybe.
What about these arrows?
That's the logo for Revive.
It's a program based out of Hayward Correctional Facility, headed up by Dana Winter.
They specialize in inmate rehabilitation.
Well, I'm guessing the rehab didn't take.
Okay, how long will it take you to pull up the files on the prisoners?
I was gonna grab some lunch.
Well, okay.
Let's see if anyone here has had Lara Vega as their arresting officer.
Oop!
Got a bite.
Michael Wynn.
Sprawl gang leader.
He was into selling Clarity.
And women.
Didn't much like being arrested by one.
- You need to piss off.
- You need to get...
Oh, I don't think so, little lady.
Ah!
Ah!
You're dead!
You hear me, you little...
Let's start there.
You really think Wynn could be the guy?
Y-You busted him almost six years ago.
Psychos have good memories and this one used to send me death threats every Christmas.
But he's in prison.
How does he get out to hurt you?
People on the inside have a lot of reach.
Anyway, that's what we're gonna find out.
Yeah, but see... what if that's just it?
What if going to see Wynn is what gets you killed?
This isn't one of our normal cases, Vega.
This is you.
Cops deal in life or death every day.
Occupational hazard.
I know that better than anyone.
Listen...
I've been probing my brain.
Trying to access that part of my memory, to just remember something.
Anything.
I don't.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
But this would be.
You would be.
I should do this alone.
Wynn is unarmed, in a room full of guards.
Besides, I took him down once.
I can do it again.
If I'm late for work again, you're gonna have to call my boss... for the last hour with my food.
I better get a refund.
I am not paying for cold moo sh... 60 years ago, companies outsourced all this stuff abroad.
Killed the working class, causing incarceration rates to skyrocket.
Now, we give the working class their jobs back, only this time, behind bars, for two cents on the dollar.
Doesn't seem right.
I'll save my crocodile tears for the victims and their families.
We don't forget the victims, Detective.
These are our reminders of past victims, past crimes... life-changing mistakes.
It also helps them move on to more productive lives.
Because all it takes is an arts and crafts project.
I know you have history with Michael Wynn and I'll admit, he's not an easy case.
But he is trying.
We believe he may be about to commit a serious crime.
According to data patterns in our Hawk-Eye system.
Right.
According to data patterns in the Hawk-Eye system.
That's impossible.
Michael is closely surveilled, like all our inmates, especially on our excursions.
You let them outside?
Well, it's good to know I'm busting my ass sending criminals to sleep away camp.
We go on weekly outings to restaurants, parks, museums.
Tomorrow, in fact.
That must be how he gets to you.
Shall we?
Detective Vega.
Heard you might be stopping by for a visit.
- I'm touched.
- Don't be.
Who's he?
New partner?
Oh, I'm jealous.
We're here on business.
Well, I thought you just missed me.
I do.
Especially your Christmas greetings.
Decided to give that up.
Changed man, Detective.
Really?
'Cause something tells me I've been on your mind.
Not really.
Sometimes, late at night,
- when I'm...
- Go ahead.
Finish the sentence.
See if the feeling's mutual.
- So you're here to flirt.
- And reminisce.
About the night I took you down.
Remember that?
Your face in the pavement.
My knee in your chest.
Good times.
You're digging up ancient history.
Do your boys here know about our history?
That you got beat up by a former high school cheerleader?
People here just care about the present, Detective.
The here and now.
Is that why you want revenge?
Put a hit out on me to get back the respect of your friends inside?
I keep the past where it belongs.
Are you finished here, Detective?
Chow time.
Stick around.
I got all the time in the world.
It was nice catching up.
Good job.
Housebroken.
Like a poodle.
Vega, watch out!
Guards!
That's two out of three.
Want to go best out of seven?
She set me up.
She set me up!
Vega, this isn't over!
You hear me...?
You baited him.
He attacked me, Ms. Winter.
And from the looks of it, he lost his field trip privileges.
Who put this here?
I don't know.
Prisoners are allowed to put things here anonymously.
It... could have been anyone over the past ten years.
Vega, what is it?
- Excuse me, please.
- What's wrong?
You got Wynn.
They won't let him go on any more excursions...
It's over, right?
Wynn's not the killer.
What?
How do you know that?
Because I think I know why I get killed.
It's not Wynn.
This watch...
It was my dad's.
He was wearing it when he was murdered 17 years ago, but it was never recovered.
The ticking sound from my vision.
Exactly.
It must all be connected.
Yeah, but connected how?
Trying to find the guy who killed my dad is gonna get me killed.
Maybe he's in this place.
Or was.
We should get Akeela to run the names of prisoners and alumni.
Yes, but there might be something better than names.
Like faces.
Back so soon?
Recordings of Beta Precrime visions.
You said that you could poke around.
I need access to them.
If they did exist, where would they be?
I told you, the feds mopped up when Precrime fell.
Maybe FBI, maybe D.I.A...
Wait-wait, D.I.A.?
Defense Intelligence.
Blake.
He has a meeting there, some deputy director.
If they still have recordings of my father's murder,
I could catch his killer.
Wait, no.
You said yourself that looking for your father's killer might be what gets you killed.
Yeah, and if it helps me catch the guy, then it's worth the risk.
What if it's not just you?
At risk?
He's right.
The public never heard of Beta Precrime.
If you go asking questions, someone's gonna wonder how you know.
Do you trust me?
Then trust me.
What happened to letting Lieutenant Blake handle the politics, Detective?
I'm learning to multitask, Mr. Director.
Besides, this place fascinates me.
So much history.
If only you could talk about it.
Well, you should come work for us one day.
Then you could be part of creating your own history that you can't talk about.
Watch it.
Please, sit down.
Much as I would like this to be a social call, my reason for asking you here is a serious one.
I can't give you too many details, but there's intelligence that suggests a terrorist attack is imminent.
Foreign?
Domestic?
What we know for certain is the group is decentralized.
We think it could be the same people who bombed the N.I.H. Took down the Monument.
But no group was ever pinned for that attack.
Not officially.
But two words keep popping up: "memento mori."
Latin.
Yeah.
For "remember you will die."
Oh, they sound friendly.
You think Hawk-Eye can help?
Well, it seems to be the best we have these days.
Computers are the most accurate predictors of future threats that we have left.
Since Precrime.
You said it.
But of course, we wasted that.
On what?
Stopping murders?
No, by missing the bigger picture.
For six years, the three Precognitives saw every murder in D.C. before it happened.
When it turned out the system wasn't foolproof, we gave up.
The next year, 4,000 people died in the bombing on the Mall.
And they would've seen it.
If we'd been smart enough to keep them.
Instead, we set them free.
And no one knows where they are now?
AGENT:
Sir...
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to cut this short.
- Something's come up.
- Of course.
You said six years?
That's how long the Precrime program ran.
Officially.
I heard rumors there was beta testing at least a year before the public knew.
They were seeing murders that no one ever tried to stop.
Vega, the man is busy.
Walk out with me.
The existence of Beta Precrime was top secret, Detective.
If the public found out that the federal government had been predicting murders that they never stopped...
There'd be a scandal.
Understandably.
Which no one wants.
And what is it you want?
Justice.
While the D.I.A. was testing Precrime's accuracy, no one was ever prosecuted for the murders the Precogs saw.
If those visions are still archived somewhere,
Metro can change that.
Cold cases.
My father was murdered that year.
Vega...
Oh, it's okay, Lieutenant.
We all got into this business for a reason.
I wish I could help, Detective.
But the Precrime vision archives were destroyed when the Supreme Court ruled the program unconstitutional.
These days, the murder visions only exist in one place.
Where?
Inside the Precogs' heads.
But good luck finding one.
The vision is still in my head?
And according to Blomfeld, all other records have been destroyed.
I'm sorry, but it's been too long.
If I still had that memory,
I would remember it.
Right, Wally?
Not necessarily.
What?
Over time, connections break down in the inferior temporal cortex and we lose the ability to access our memories.
- We forget.
- Correct.
However, some trace of the memory still exists as a pattern of neural connections deep in the hippocampus.
Exposed to the right stimulus, those neurons light up.
- The right stimulus?
- Through BIMR.
Brain Imaging Memory Recall.
"Beemer" for short.
It takes a specialized piece of equipment to scan those memories.
And could we find one of those machines around?
Yes.
Where?
Under the stairs.
I offered to take it off the program's hands early in the trial process, so they never had a chance to destroy it.
Wally, if you knew you could access my old visions, why didn't you tell us?
You didn't tell me Vega's father was the victim.
Besides, there's some...
discomfort involved.
Well, it can't be worse than what Dash has been through already.
There are ways.
- Forget it then.
- No.
Let's just do it.
But that's not the hard part.
Your visions from the days of Precrime were formed as part of a symbiotic neural link with your twin brother.
Each brain was just one half of the whole.
That means we can't even access those memories without...
Arthur.
Yes.
And visual stimulation...
Pictures, home video from you, Vega, of your father.
I can get those easy.
But I can't get Arthur.
He won't help us.
Sure, he will.
As long as the price is right.
No, not this time.
Why?
What's different?
Careful.
He cheats.
I'm certain the guy on your left is wanted by Interpol.
Please don't arrest him.
Why?
He has all the chips.
Not for long.
What's this about?
Agatha's wrong, Arthur.
My brother would make a lousy spy.
He knows me.
He knows I couldn't betray him like that.
Then that settles it.
I'll stake my life and freedom based on my brother's gut.
I'm gonna need you to.
Because I can't find the person who killed my father without your help.
Your father?
It happened before Precrime started, when you three were still in training.
Sorry to hear that.
You guys never knew your father.
Terrific role model.
Dumped my mom before we were born.
Well, mine was a good cop and even better father.
He was home every night even though he worked double shifts.
The day he died, I hurt him.
I know I did.
Families fight.
I've heard.
And what makes you so warm and fuzzy anyway?
Are you really asking me that?
Ten years in a milk bath, I know.
But it's not like your brother had it any easier.
I've seen things he hasn't.
I would never do anything to hurt Dash.
Or any of you.
I think you know that.
What does your gut say?
That you have a good chance of ending up dead very soon.
Cash me out.
Only because it's your damn birthday.
Arthur, you remember Wally.
Arthur.
So good to see you.
You're the guy who used to do my nails.
Knock it off.
Let's just do this.
It's, an optogenic-based brain-imaging memory recall device.
It looks for ion channel...
Try it again.
Like I'm six.
Strap you both into that thing and mine your brain for the vision.
Mine, like dig?
Sure, why not?
Coming?
Thank you.
Anytime.
Never again.
You two always worked more smoothly with a little lubricant...
Dopamine, opioids.
Vodka's the best I got.
What, no tonic?
You'll also need these... if you've grown attached to your teeth.
Here comes the pinch.
What we're looking for are patterns...
Specific neural circuits in their brains that code for memories of your dad.
That's why we show them pictures, home movies, recordings of his voice.
I, Hamilton Vega take thee, Lily Vega to be my lawfully wedded wife.
Three, two, one, blow!
Come on, put the camera down.
Come on, let's cut the cake.
They're not responding yet.
How much longer can they take this?
I don't know.
Their memories are-are so degraded, they're not remembering your dad.
He used to whistle this to me.
Hang on, I'm getting something.
It's the whistling.
It's-it's sparking something, an old vision.
Are you sure you want to see this?
Yes.
Oh, my God.
From everything I found, Dina Winter is a saint.
ALU Person of the Year, Luxor genius grant.
You sure she's your guy?
She killed my father in cold blood.
I saw her do it, we both did.
Well, they didn't have a history that I can see.
She was into drugs, though.
Her earlier years.
I count three possession charges the same year your father died.
What about this guy?
Any facial matches?
What do we know about him?
Just that he'd make a terrible eyewitness.
Can you swipe that off, please?
Sorry.
She just doesn't seem like the same person.
People will surprise you.
So how do we bring her down?
I confront her.
Record the whole thing with my lenses, get her to confess.
And if that doesn't work?
You saw a vision of her shooting me too, right?
If I can't nail her for my father's murder,
- I'll get her for attempting mine.
- No.
No way.
It's too dangerous.
I won't let you.
It's the only way.
She saw me take my father's watch.
She could run, she could get away.
You could die.
I think you should do it.
She needs to do it.
I love that you care, and I'm thankful for what you and your brother did for me, but this is something I've been living with for a long time.
I need to do this, Dash.
Then I need to come with you.
Lara?
Hi.
Hey.
Where are you going?
I was just headed out.
Rico, go.
Mom, I really have somewhere to go.
I'm not just leaving to leave.
I still miss him, too, baby.
You ever think about the person who did it?
For years...
I used to fanaticize about everything I would do to them.
How much I would give to spread the hurt.
To make them feel it, too.
But you got over it?
Let's just say that I'm happy
I never found them.
I got to go.
They're chocolate.
Dulce de leche frosting...
Your favorite.
Save me one.
You don't have to do this.
If you think that, you don't understand.
I was embarrassed when my father wore his uniform and dropped me off at school that day.
I told him to drop me around the block.
And I'd just walk.
That's not a good enough reason to get yourself killed.
Don't worry.
I ditched the jersey.
We can change the future, right?
Sometimes it's the past that's harder to escape.
Vega?
Don't lose yourself in there.
Detective Vega.
Kind of late to be making house calls.
I'm pretty sure you recognize this.
I'm not sure what you mean.
Isn't that the watch you took from my clinic this morning?
No, it's the watch you took off my father's body after you killed him.
You're recording this, I assume?
With one of those nifty A.R. devices?
I work with criminals, remember?
You are a criminal.
You're a murderer.
The-the person who... murdered your father was a junkie.
Someone who couldn't see past her next fix.
Stop pretending like you're talking about someone else.
And one stupid night, when she was so hopped up on heroin she couldn't see straight, she...
did something terrible.
Something she could never take back...
You're talking about yourself!
Calm down, Vega.
Be careful.
That junkie...
It was you, admit it!
Vega!
It was you.
That night weighs on her...
still.
And... no amount of good she's done has ever made it right.
But... she kept trying.
Keeps trying.
You got to turn your life around.
Because you got to have one.
You got to live.
He didn't.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Say it was you.
Please...
I-I have a family.
A son...
I've changed.
I'm not that junkie in the alley anymore.
You expect me to buy that?
!
You would shoot me right now if you had the chance.
Where's your gun?
I have one for protection, but...
Not another step!
Where's your gun?
!
The only person with a gun here is you!
You can't know how sorry I am.
It was the worst mistake I'll ever make.
Saying yes.
"Saying... yes"?
To the job.
You were hired?
Vega, look in the mirror!
Are you okay, Mom?
Bradford, put down my gun!
Bradford... that's your name?
I'm Detective Vega.
Don't move!
Vega, look at his shirt.
Maybe you weren't the victim in my vision.
He was!
Bradford.
How about this?
How about I put my gun down first?
Okay?
- Okay...
- Stay back!
Bradford, a long time ago, your mom... did something she can't take back.
I won't make the same mistake.
You shouldn't, either.
This isn't the way.
Listen to her, honey.
Okay.
You're okay.
- You're okay.
- Are you okay?
!
Yeah.
Please, he-he didn't mean to...
Go upstairs, baby.
Before... you said someone hired you to kill my dad.
Who?
Lycon.
He was my dealer.
Some guys came to him.
Said to make it look like a mugging.
Which guys?
Who were they?
I don't know.
I never met them face to face.
But I will tell you everything I know.
Just... keep my son out of this.
Please?
Let this end with us.
An eyeless man?
Lycon, a longtime dope peddler in the Sprawl back when Deena was a junkie.
He might be the go-between for whoever hired her to kill my father.
No one's heard from him in years, but we figured with your connections...
If this is all you have to go on, it's pretty thin.
I'll look into it on my end.
Thank you, Arthur.
For this and for before.
I don't expect a thank you from you.
But an apology for slugging me in the mouth would be nice.
Why?
You deserved it.
Okay, then.
But next time?
I hit you back.
You know your way out.
I just need a little more time.
You know I'll help you with this Lycon thing.
Whatever you need.
Thanks.
But right now, I need to go home.
Vega?
When you get home, grab the chair.
Mom?
Happy birthday.
It's over.
- (thudding nearby) - (thunder crashes)
Anybody there?
(loud thud)
Hello?
(beeping)
(quietly):
Ah, shut that off.
(gun clicks)
No!
No!
No!
AGATHA:
Can you see it?
What am I looking at?
Our future.
Plans for a new containment system.
A milk bath, Arthur.
More advanced than the one that held us during Precrime.
This file's ten years old.
Because the program was abolished before they could move us into it.
- "They"?
- The feds.
Defense Intelligence Agency.
They had bigger things in mind for us than just stopping local murders in D.C.
Like National Security?
We were going to be their secret weapon.
But the project was halted when they set us free.
So that's a good thing.
Only if it stays that way.
This is what I've been seeing in my vision, Arthur, every day since Dash went back to the city and started working with that cop.
You asked me to stop helping them and I did.
That isn't enough.
- What do you think I am?
- A realist.
Unlike your brother.
She will betray us, Arthur.
You don't know that.
I see it.
What I see is ancient history.
Yes.
But when we're too blind to learn its lessons, history repeats.
Knew I'd regret giving you your own key, Mom.
Yeah, you probably should've thought that one through.
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.
Made your favorite.
Algae and palm frittata.
I can't.
Blake's giving a tour to some bigwig fed today.
- Wants everyone at the precinct early.
- Oh.
Maybe we could plan a little get-together for tonight.
You know, something simple.
Just friends and family?
I-I probably have to work late.
I love you.
You plan on going the whole day avoiding this.
If people will let me.
(indistinct chatter)
Happy birthday.
Where am I gonna put those?
In water.
With protein, I'm told.
I'm a cop, Dash.
Would you give flowers to Blake?
Well, I don't know him very well.
When is his birthday?
(sighs)
It's just I'm not, I'm not big on birthdays.
What?
I love them.
Of course, I've only really had ten while technically conscious.
They're very nice.
Thank you.
Hey, Vega.
Your prom night?
You want to eat them?
Yeah.
I won't make that mistake again.
It's not your fault.
Vega and her dad share the same birthday.
Standing ten feet away.
Not in Boston.
Well, he should know why you're being a bitch.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
She's right.
It's been 17 years and sometimes it feels like it was just yesterday.
They never caught the guy who did it.
"17 years."
Think Precrime would've been up and running in eight months.
You would've seen it.
What?
Well, Precrime didn't start until September of '48 officially, but they had the three of us in secret testing a year before that.
For a year?
Narcissist incoming.
(indistinct chatter)
Detective Vega?
Henry Blomfeld, Deputy Director of the D.I.A.
Nice to meet you.
Her Hawk-Eye analyst, Dash.
Vega?
- Walk with us?
- Oh, it's okay.
Aw, you really should.
I'm fascinating company.
And I'm Akeela.
Pleasure.
- (bracelet buzzing)
- Uh... uh-oh.
BLOMFELD:
I was just telling your lieutenant how impressed I was with Hawk-Eye's numbers this month.
He tells me you're partly responsible.
Thank you.
But Lieutenant Blake is just being modest.
It's all him... and Hawk-Eye.
I don't think so.
You've got a clearance rate four times higher than average.
And all on Class One homicides.
You should take the victory lap, Detective.
You've earned it.
Mr. Blomfeld has invited us both to, uh, come by the agency this afternoon.
I told him we'd be honored.
Vega?
Thanks for the invitation, but you're the politician, Will.
I'll stick to catching the bad guys.
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Director.
You as well, Detective.
(ticking)
(scream)
VEGA:
Play it back.
Frame by frame.
(ticking)
What's that ticking sound?
Is that a clock?
It's all I could hear before the scream.
Okay, so it looks like the murder happens indoors.
I can't tell if it's day or night.
Two gunshots.
Messy, not calculated.
This happens in the moment.
No faces, no identifiable markings.
Hold it.
What is it?
It's a 2019 Red Clouds jersey.
It's the year that they changed their name.
It's almost impossible to get.
Believe me, I've tried.
Well, if it's rare, maybe we can get Akeela to run the purchase records.
(clears his throat)
Wally, one more thing.
Dash said he was in the milk bath a year before they started Precrime.
Beta testing.
Working out the kinks.
We were instructed to record everything the Precogs saw, matching up their future visions to the deaths that followed.
But we weren't legally able to act yet.
Worst year of my life.
Mine, too.
Why?
What happened?
- Oh, Vega...
- If someone was murdered that year, and they didn't catch the killer, are those visions recorded somewhere?
(sighs)
Maybe, but-but I doubt it.
After Precrime ended, the feds pretty much stripped everything, covering their asses.
I can ask one of my old buddies, though, if you want me to poke around.
No, it was a long shot.
Thanks, Wally.
Oh, thank God.
Blake made me walk that stick-up-his-ass fed through Hawk-Eye's protocols.
All 49 of them.
I need some action.
Then you're in luck.
We need you to run a purchase.
Hit me.
Vintage 2019 Red Clouds jersey.
Very funny, Vega.
Am I missing something?
Yes, the whole concept of a birthday surprise.
Which I guess is impossible now that you're working with a... (whispers): a Precog.
I knew you'd been eyeing one, so I got it for your birthday.
You like?
Vega, you're the victim.
AKEELA:
Victim?
Is anyone angry at you?
Someone who might be holding a grudge?
Well, I was dismissive of my partner after he gave me flowers.
He might be insulted.
This isn't funny, Vega.
I'm a homicide cop.
The line of people pissed at me starts on the left.
Relax, they made 500 of those jerseys.
So?
So we didn't see my face in the murder vision.
Which means, at worst, I have a one in 500 chance of being murdered in the next few days.
Well, don't pursue this and it's almost zero.
Dash, we're gonna stop this one just like we stopped the others.
I'm gonna go see Arthur.
In the meantime, burn that jersey.
What do you know?
Apparently someone doesn't want Vega to see her next birthday.
I'm not in the mood for glib today.
And I wasn't in the market for a fat lip.
Why didn't you call me when you got Vega's name?
Because of Agatha?
Because she saw a milk bath in her vision?
Because she found one.
The feds had plans for us when Precrime ended.
Maybe still do.
They set us free.
Minds change.
And hearts.
Even if that's true, nobody knows where we are.
Except Vega.
I didn't get another name.
Laura Vega...
That's all I know.
If you're lying to me...
You can always punch me in the face again.
I can't believe I bought you that jersey.
VEGA:
Forget about it.
Look, I was thinking...
I got you a death shirt for your birthday.
I'm the worst friend ever.
Akeela... any details from the murder vision?
Did anything pop?
I don't know.
Maybe.
What about these arrows?
That's the logo for Revive.
It's a program based out of Hayward Correctional Facility, headed up by Dana Winter.
They specialize in inmate rehabilitation.
Well, I'm guessing the rehab didn't take.
Okay, how long will it take you to pull up the files on the prisoners?
I was gonna grab some lunch.
Well, okay.
Let's see if anyone here has had Lara Vega as their arresting officer.
Oop!
Got a bite.
Michael Wynn.
Sprawl gang leader.
He was into selling Clarity.
And women.
Didn't much like being arrested by one.
- You need to piss off.
- You need to get...
Oh, I don't think so, little lady.
(grunting)
Ah!
Ah!
You're dead!
You hear me, you little...
Let's start there.
DASH:
You really think Wynn could be the guy?
Y-You busted him almost six years ago.
Psychos have good memories and this one used to send me death threats every Christmas.
But he's in prison.
How does he get out to hurt you?
People on the inside have a lot of reach.
Anyway, that's what we're gonna find out.
Yeah, but see... what if that's just it?
What if going to see Wynn is what gets you killed?
This isn't one of our normal cases, Vega.
This is you.
Cops deal in life or death every day.
Occupational hazard.
I know that better than anyone.
Listen...
I've been probing my brain.
Trying to access that part of my memory, to just remember something.
Anything.
I don't.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
But this would be.
You would be.
I should do this alone.
Wynn is unarmed, in a room full of guards.
Besides, I took him down once.
I can do it again.
(indistinct chatter)
If I'm late for work again, you're gonna have to call my boss... for the last hour with my food.
I better get a refund.
I am not paying for cold moo sh...
WOMAN: 60 years ago, companies outsourced all this stuff abroad.
Killed the working class, causing incarceration rates to skyrocket.
Now, we give the working class their jobs back, only this time, behind bars, for two cents on the dollar.
Doesn't seem right.
I'll save my crocodile tears for the victims and their families.
We don't forget the victims, Detective.
These are our reminders of past victims, past crimes... life-changing mistakes.
It also helps them move on to more productive lives.
Because all it takes is an arts and crafts project.
I know you have history with Michael Wynn and I'll admit, he's not an easy case.
But he is trying.
We believe he may be about to commit a serious crime.
According to data patterns in our Hawk-Eye system.
Right.
According to data patterns in the Hawk-Eye system.
WINTER:
That's impossible.
Michael is closely surveilled, like all our inmates, especially on our excursions.
You let them outside?
Well, it's good to know I'm busting my ass sending criminals to sleep away camp.
We go on weekly outings to restaurants, parks, museums.
Tomorrow, in fact.
That must be how he gets to you.
Shall we?
Detective Vega.
Heard you might be stopping by for a visit.
- I'm touched.
- Don't be.
Who's he?
New partner?
Oh, I'm jealous.
We're here on business.
Well, I thought you just missed me.
I do.
Especially your Christmas greetings.
Decided to give that up.
Changed man, Detective.
Really?
'Cause something tells me I've been on your mind.
Not really.
Sometimes, late at night,
- when I'm...
- Go ahead.
Finish the sentence.
See if the feeling's mutual.
- So you're here to flirt.
- And reminisce.
About the night I took you down.
Remember that?
Your face in the pavement.
My knee in your chest.
Good times.
You're digging up ancient history.
VEGA:
Do your boys here know about our history?
That you got beat up by a former high school cheerleader?
Hmm.
People here just care about the present, Detective.
The here and now.
Is that why you want revenge?
Put a hit out on me to get back the respect of your friends inside?
I keep the past where it belongs.
(buzzer sounds)
Are you finished here, Detective?
Chow time.
Stick around.
I got all the time in the world.
It was nice catching up.
Good job.
Housebroken.
Like a poodle.
Vega, watch out!
(shouts)
- WINTER:
Guards!
- (grunting)
That's two out of three.
Want to go best out of seven?
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
She set me up.
She set me up!
Vega, this isn't over!
You hear me...?
You baited him.
He attacked me, Ms. Winter.
And from the looks of it, he lost his field trip privileges.
Who put this here?
I don't know.
Prisoners are allowed to put things here anonymously.
It... could have been anyone over the past ten years.
Vega, what is it?
- Excuse me, please.
- What's wrong?
You got Wynn.
They won't let him go on any more excursions...
It's over, right?
Wynn's not the killer.
What?
How do you know that?
Because I think I know why I get killed.
VEGA:
It's not Wynn.
This watch...
It was my dad's.
He was wearing it when he was murdered 17 years ago, but it was never recovered.
The ticking sound from my vision.
Exactly.
It must all be connected.
Yeah, but connected how?
Trying to find the guy who killed my dad is gonna get me killed.
Maybe he's in this place.
Or was.
We should get Akeela to run the names of prisoners and alumni.
Yes, but there might be something better than names.
Like faces.
Back so soon?
Recordings of Beta Precrime visions.
You said that you could poke around.
I need access to them.
If they did exist, where would they be?
I told you, the feds mopped up when Precrime fell.
Maybe FBI, maybe D.I.A...
Wait-wait, D.I.A.?
Defense Intelligence.
Blake.
He has a meeting there, some deputy director.
If they still have recordings of my father's murder,
I could catch his killer.
Wait, no.
You said yourself that looking for your father's killer might be what gets you killed.
Yeah, and if it helps me catch the guy, then it's worth the risk.
What if it's not just you?
At risk?
WALLY:
He's right.
The public never heard of Beta Precrime.
If you go asking questions, someone's gonna wonder how you know.
Do you trust me?
Then trust me.
BLOMFELD:
What happened to letting Lieutenant Blake handle the politics, Detective?
I'm learning to multitask, Mr. Director.
Besides, this place fascinates me.
So much history.
If only you could talk about it.
Well, you should come work for us one day.
Then you could be part of creating your own history that you can't talk about.
Watch it.
Please, sit down.
Much as I would like this to be a social call, my reason for asking you here is a serious one.
I can't give you too many details, but there's intelligence that suggests a terrorist attack is imminent.
Foreign?
Domestic?
What we know for certain is the group is decentralized.
We think it could be the same people who bombed the N.I.H. Took down the Monument.
But no group was ever pinned for that attack.
Not officially.
But two words keep popping up: "memento mori."
Latin.
Yeah.
For "remember you will die."
Oh, they sound friendly.
You think Hawk-Eye can help?
Well, it seems to be the best we have these days.
Computers are the most accurate predictors of future threats that we have left.
Since Precrime.
You said it.
But of course, we wasted that.
On what?
Stopping murders?
No, by missing the bigger picture.
For six years, the three Precognitives saw every murder in D.C. before it happened.
When it turned out the system wasn't foolproof, we gave up.
The next year, 4,000 people died in the bombing on the Mall.
And they would've seen it.
If we'd been smart enough to keep them.
Instead, we set them free.
And no one knows where they are now?
- (door opens)
- AGENT:
Sir... (whispering)
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to cut this short.
- Something's come up.
- Of course.
You said six years?
That's how long the Precrime program ran.
Officially.
I heard rumors there was beta testing at least a year before the public knew.
They were seeing murders that no one ever tried to stop.
Uh, Vega, the man is busy.
Walk out with me.
The existence of Beta Precrime was top secret, Detective.
If the public found out that the federal government had been predicting murders that they never stopped...
There'd be a scandal.
Understandably.
Which no one wants.
And what is it you want?
Justice.
While the D.I.A. was testing Precrime's accuracy, no one was ever prosecuted for the murders the Precogs saw.
If those visions are still archived somewhere,
Metro can change that.
Cold cases.
My father was murdered that year.
Vega...
Oh, it's okay, Lieutenant.
We all got into this business for a reason.
I wish I could help, Detective.
But the Precrime vision archives were destroyed when the Supreme Court ruled the program unconstitutional.
These days, the murder visions only exist in one place.
Where?
Inside the Precogs' heads.
But good luck finding one.
DASH:
The vision is still in my head?
VEGA:
And according to Blomfeld, all other records have been destroyed.
I'm sorry, but it's been too long.
If I still had that memory,
I would remember it.
Right, Wally?
Not necessarily.
What?
WALLY:
Over time, connections break down in the inferior temporal cortex and we lose the ability to access our memories.
- We forget.
- Correct.
However, some trace of the memory still exists as a pattern of neural connections deep in the hippocampus.
Exposed to the right stimulus, those neurons light up.
- The right stimulus?
- Through BIMR.
Brain Imaging Memory Recall.
"Beemer" for short.
It takes a specialized piece of equipment to scan those memories.
And could we find one of those machines around?
Yes.
Where?
Under the stairs.
I offered to take it off the program's hands early in the trial process, so they never had a chance to destroy it.
Wally, if you knew you could access my old visions, why didn't you tell us?
You didn't tell me Vega's father was the victim.
Besides, there's some, uh...
discomfort involved.
Well, it can't be worse than what Dash has been through already.
There are ways.
- Forget it then.
- No.
Let's just do it.
But that's not the hard part.
Your visions from the days of Precrime were formed as part of a symbiotic neural link with your twin brother.
Each brain was just one half of the whole.
That means we can't even access those memories without...
Arthur.
Yes.
WALLY:
And visual stimulation...
Pictures, home video from you, Vega, of your father.
I can get those easy.
But I can't get Arthur.
He won't help us.
Sure, he will.
As long as the price is right.
No, not this time.
Why?
What's different?
♪ You've got those loud bitches ♪
♪ Loud bitches telling you lies ♪
♪ Don't listen to those girls ♪
♪ They're just snakes in disguise ♪
♪ You've got the truth coming to you ♪
♪ And you've got to see ♪
♪ Got to step up your game if you want to run with me ♪
♪ Prophecy, prophecy ♪
♪ Should have been dead by 18 ♪
♪ Oh, mercy me, I landed back on my feet... ♪
Careful.
He cheats.
(men chuckle)
I'm certain the guy on your left is wanted by Interpol.
Please don't arrest him.
Why?
He has all the chips.
Not for long.
What's this about?
Agatha's wrong, Arthur.
My brother would make a lousy spy.
He knows me.
He knows I couldn't betray him like that.
Then that settles it.
I'll stake my life and freedom based on my brother's gut.
I'm gonna need you to.
Because I can't find the person who killed my father without your help.
Your father?
It happened before Precrime started, when you three were still in training.
Sorry to hear that.
You guys never knew your father.
(chuckles)
Terrific role model.
Dumped my mom before we were born.
Well, mine was a good cop and even better father.
He was home every night even though he worked double shifts.
The day he died, I hurt him.
I know I did.
Families fight.
I've heard.
And what makes you so warm and fuzzy anyway?
Are you really asking me that?
Ten years in a milk bath, I know.
But it's not like your brother had it any easier.
I've seen things he hasn't.
I would never do anything to hurt Dash.
Or any of you.
I think you know that.
What does your gut say?
That you have a good chance of ending up dead very soon.
Cash me out.
Only because it's your damn birthday.
Arthur, you remember Wally.
Arthur.
So good to see you.
You're the guy who used to do my nails.
Knock it off.
Let's just do this.
It's, uh, an optogenic-based brain-imaging memory recall device.
It looks for ion channel...
Try it again.
Like I'm six.
Strap you both into that thing and mine your brain for the vision.
Mine, like dig?
Sure, why not?
Coming?
Thank you.
Anytime.
Never again.
WALLY:
You two always worked more smoothly with a little lubricant...
Dopamine, opioids.
Vodka's the best I got.
What, no tonic?
WALLY:
You'll also need these... if you've grown attached to your teeth.
Here comes the pinch.
What we're looking for are patterns...
Specific neural circuits in their brains that code for memories of your dad.
That's why we show them pictures, home movies, recordings of his voice.
MAN:
I, Hamilton Vega take thee, Lily Vega to be my lawfully wedded wife.
ALL:
Three, two, one, blow!
(clapping, cheering)
Come on, put the camera down.
Come on, let's cut the cake.
They're not responding yet.
How much longer can they take this?
I don't know.
Their memories are-are so degraded, they're not remembering your dad.
(Hamilton whistles)
He used to whistle this to me.
Hang on, I'm getting something.
WALLY:
It's the whistling.
It's-it's sparking something, an old vision.
Are you sure you want to see this?
Yes.
(gun fires)
(gun fires)
Oh, my God.
From everything I found, Dina Winter is a saint.
ALU Person of the Year, Luxor genius grant.
You sure she's your guy?
She killed my father in cold blood.
I saw her do it, we both did.
AKEELA:
Well, they didn't have a history that I can see.
She was into drugs, though.
Her earlier years.
I count three possession charges the same year your father died.
What about this guy?
Any facial matches?
What do we know about him?
Just that he'd make a terrible eyewitness.
Can you swipe that off, please?
Sorry.
She just doesn't seem like the same person.
People will surprise you.
So how do we bring her down?
I confront her.
Record the whole thing with my lenses, get her to confess.
And if that doesn't work?
You saw a vision of her shooting me too, right?
If I can't nail her for my father's murder,
- I'll get her for attempting mine.
- No.
No way.
It's too dangerous.
I won't let you.
It's the only way.
She saw me take my father's watch.
She could run, she could get away.
You could die.
I think you should do it.
She needs to do it.
VEGA:
I love that you care, and I'm thankful for what you and your brother did for me, but this is something I've been living with for a long time.
I need to do this, Dash.
Then I need to come with you.
(door opens)
LILY:
Lara?
Hi.
Hey.
RICO:
Where are you going?
I was just headed out.
Rico, go.
Uh, Mom, I really have somewhere to go.
I'm not just leaving to leave.
I still miss him, too, baby.
You ever think about the person who did it?
For years...
I used to fanaticize about everything I would do to them.
How much I would give to spread the hurt.
To make them feel it, too.
But you got over it?
Let's just say that I'm happy
I never found them.
I got to go.
They're chocolate.
Dulce de leche frosting...
Your favorite.
Save me one.
(crickets trilling)
(sighs)
You don't have to do this.
If you think that, you don't understand.
I was embarrassed when my father wore his uniform and dropped me off at school that day.
I told him to drop me around the block.
And I'd just walk.
That's not a good enough reason to get yourself killed.
Don't worry.
I ditched the jersey.
We can change the future, right?
Sometimes it's the past that's harder to escape.
Vega?
Don't lose yourself in there.
(footsteps approaching)
Detective Vega.
Kind of late to be making house calls.
I'm pretty sure you recognize this.
Um, I'm not sure what you mean.
Isn't that the watch you took from my clinic this morning?
No, it's the watch you took off my father's body after you killed him.
You're recording this, I assume?
With one of those nifty A.R. devices?
I work with criminals, remember?
You are a criminal.
You're a murderer.
The-the person who... murdered your father was a junkie.
Someone who couldn't see past her next fix.
Stop pretending like you're talking about someone else.
And one stupid night, when she was so hopped up on heroin she couldn't see straight, she...
did something terrible.
Something she could never take back...
You're talking about yourself!
Calm down, Vega.
Be careful.
That junkie...
It was you, admit it!
- (screams)
- Vega!
It was you.
That night weighs on her...
still.
And... no amount of good she's done has ever made it right.
But... she kept trying.
Keeps trying.
You got to turn your life around.
Because you got to have one.
You got to live.
He didn't.
(gasps)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Say it was you.
Please...
I-I have a family.
A son...
I've changed.
I'm not that junkie in the alley anymore.
You expect me to buy that?
!
You would shoot me right now if you had the chance.
Where's your gun?
I have one for protection, but, uh...
Not another step!
Where's your gun?
!
The only person with a gun here is you!
You can't know how sorry I am.
It was the worst mistake I'll ever make.
Saying yes.
"Saying... yes"?
To the job.
You were hired?
Vega, look in the mirror!
Uh, are you okay, Mom?
Bradford, put down my gun!
Bradford... that's your name?
I'm Detective Vega.
Don't move!
DASH:
Vega, look at his shirt.
Maybe you weren't the victim in my vision.
He was!
Bradford.
How about this?
How about I put my gun down first?
Okay?
- Okay...
- Stay back!
Bradford, a long time ago, your mom... did something she can't take back.
I won't make the same mistake.
You shouldn't, either.
This isn't the way.
Listen to her, honey.
Okay.
You're okay.
- You're okay.
- Are you okay?
!
Yeah.
Please, he-he didn't mean to... (whispers):
Go upstairs, baby.
Before... you said someone hired you to kill my dad.
Who?
Lycon.
He was my dealer.
Some guys came to him.
Said to make it look like a mugging.
Which guys?
Who were they?
I don't know.
I never met them face to face.
But I will tell you everything I know.
Just... keep my son out of this.
Please?
Let this end with us.
An eyeless man?
Lycon, a longtime dope peddler in the Sprawl back when Deena was a junkie.
He might be the go-between for whoever hired her to kill my father.
DASH:
No one's heard from him in years, but we figured with your connections...
If this is all you have to go on, it's pretty thin.
I'll look into it on my end.
Thank you, Arthur.
For this and for before.
I don't expect a thank you from you.
But an apology for slugging me in the mouth would be nice.
Why?
You deserved it.
Okay, then.
But next time?
I hit you back.
You know your way out.
I just need a little more time.
You know I'll help you with this Lycon thing.
Whatever you need.
Thanks.
But right now, I need to go home.
Vega?
When you get home, grab the chair.

Anybody there?
Hello?
Ah, shut that off.
No!
Can you see it?
What am I looking at?
Our future.
Plans for a new containment system.
A milk bath, Arthur.
More advanced than the one that held us during Precrime.
This file's ten years old.
Because the program was abolished before they could move us into it.
"They"?
The feds.
Defense Intelligence Agency.
They had bigger things in mind for us than just stopping local murders in D.C.
Like National Security?
We were going to be their secret weapon.
But the project was halted when they set us free.
So that's a good thing.
Only if it stays that way.
This is what I've been seeing in my vision, Arthur, every day since Dash went back to the city and started working with that cop.
You asked me to stop helping them and I did.
That isn't enough.
What do you think I am?
A realist.
Unlike your brother.
She will betray us, Arthur.
You don't know that.
I see it.
What I see is ancient history.
Yes.
But when we're too blind to learn its lessons, history repeats.
Knew I'd regret giving you your own key, Mom.
Yeah, you probably should've thought that one through.
Thanks.
Made your favorite.
Algae and palm frittata.
I can't.
Blake's giving a tour to some bigwig fed today.
Wants everyone at the precinct early.
Maybe we could plan a little get-together for tonight.
You know, something simple.
Just friends and family?
I-I probably have to work late.
I love you.
You plan on going the whole day avoiding this.
If people will let me.
Happy birthday.
Where am I gonna put those?
In water.
With protein, I'm told.
I'm a cop, Dash.
Would you give flowers to Blake?
Well, I don't know him very well.
When is his birthday?
It's just I'm not,
I'm not big on birthdays.
What?
I love them.
Of course, I've only really had ten while technically conscious.
They're very nice.
Thank you.
Hey, Vega.
Your prom night?
You want to eat them?
I won't make that mistake again.
It's not your fault.
Vega and her dad share the same birthday.
Standing ten feet away.
Not in Boston.
Well, he should know why you're being a bitch.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
She's right.
It's been 17 years and sometimes it feels like it was just yesterday.
They never caught the guy who did it.
"17 years."
Think Precrime would've been up and running in eight months.
You would've seen it.
What?
Well, Precrime didn't start until September of '48 officially, but they had the three of us in secret testing a year before that.
For a year?
Narcissist incoming.
Detective Vega?
Henry Blomfeld, Deputy Director of the D.I.A.
Nice to meet you.
Her Hawk-Eye analyst, Dash.
Vega?
Walk with us?
Oh, it's okay.
Aw, you really should.
I'm fascinating company.
And I'm Akeela.
Pleasure.
I was just telling your Lieutenant how impressed I was with Hawk-Eye's numbers this month.
He tells me you're partly responsible.
Thank you.
But Lieutenant Blake is just being modest.
It's all him... and Hawk-Eye.
I don't think so.
You've got a clearance rate four times higher than average.
And all on Class One homicides.
You should take the victory lap, Detective.
You've earned it.
Mr. Blomfeld has invited us both to, uh, come by the agency this afternoon.
I told him we'd be honored.
Vega?
Thanks for the invitation, but you're the politician, Will.
I'll stick to catching the bad guys.
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Director.
You as well, Detective.
Play it back.
Frame by frame.
What's that ticking sound?
Is that a clock?
It's all I could hear before the scream.
Okay, so it looks like the murder happens indoors.
I can't tell if it's day or night.
Two gunshots.
Messy, not calculated.
This happens in the moment.
No faces, no identifiable markings.
Hold it.
What is it?
It's a 2019 Red Clouds jersey.
It's the year that they changed their name.
It's almost impossible to get.
Believe me, I've tried.
Well, if it's rare, maybe we can get Akeela to run the purchase records.
Wally, one more thing.
Dash said he was in the milk bath a year before they started Precrime.
Beta testing.
Working out the kinks.
We were instructed to record everything the Precogs saw, matching up their future visions to the deaths that followed.
But we weren't legally able to act yet.
Worst year of my life.
Mine, too.
Why?
What happened?
- Oh, Vega--
- If someone was murdered that year, and they didn't catch the killer, are those visions recorded somewhere?
Maybe, but-but I doubt it.
After Precrime ended, the feds pretty much stripped everything, covering their asses.
I can ask one of my old buddies, though, if you want me to poke around.
No, it was a long shot.
Thanks, Wally.
Oh, thank God.
Blake made me walk that stick-up-his-ass fed through Hawk-Eye's protocols.
All 49 of them.
- I need some action.
- Then you're in luck.
We need you to run a purchase.
Hit me.
Vintage 2019 Red Clouds jersey.
Very funny, Vega.
Am I missing something?
Yes, the whole concept of a birthday surprise.
Which I guess is impossible now that you're working with a-- a Precog.
I knew you'd been eyeing one, so I got it for your birthday.
You like?
Vega, you're the victim.
Victim?
Is anyone angry at you?
Someone who might be holding a grudge?
Well, I was dismissive of my partner after he gave me flowers.
He might be insulted.
This isn't funny, Vega.
I'm a homicide cop.
The line of people pissed at me starts on the left.
Relax, they made 500 of those jerseys.
So?
So we didn't see my face in the murder vision.
Which means, at worst, I have a one in 500 chance of being murdered in the next few days.
Well, don't pursue this and it's almost zero.
Dash, we're gonna stop this one just like we stopped the others.
I'm gonna go see Arthur.
In the meantime, burn that jersey.
What do you know?
Apparently someone doesn't want Vega to see her next birthday.
I'm not in the mood for glib today.
And I wasn't in the market for a fat lip.
Why didn't you call me when you got Vega's name?
Because of Agatha?
Because she saw a milk bath in her vision?
Because she found one.
The feds had plans for us when Precrime ended.
Maybe still do.
They set us free.
Minds change.
And hearts.
Even if that's true, nobody knows where we are.
Except Vega.
I didn't get another name.
Laura Vega... that's all I know.
If you're lying to me...
You can always punch me in the face again.
I can't believe I bought you that jersey.
Forget about it.
Look, I was thinking...
I got you a death shirt for your birthday.
I'm the worst friend ever.
Akeela... any details from the murder vision?
Did anything pop?
I don't know.
Maybe.
What about these arrows?
That's the logo for Revive.
It's a program based out of Hayward Correctional Facility, headed up by Dana Winter.
They specialize in inmate rehabilitation.
Well, I'm guessing the rehab didn't take.
Okay, how long will it take you to pull up the files on the prisoners?
I was gonna grab some lunch.
Well, okay.
Let's see if anyone here has had Laura Vega as their arresting officer.
Oop!
Got a bite.
Michael Wynn.
Sprawl gang leader.
He was into selling Clarity.
And women.
Didn't much like being arrested by one.
You need to piss off.
You need to get...
Oh, I don't think so, little lady.
Ah!
Ah!
You're dead!
You hear me, you little...
Let's start there.
You really think Wynn could be the guy?
Y-You busted him almost six years ago.
Psychos have good memories and this one used to send me death threats every Christmas.
But he's in prison.
How does he get out to hurt you?
People on the inside have a lot of reach.
Anyway, that's what we're gonna find out.
Yeah, but see... what if that's just it?
What if going to see Wynn is what gets you killed?
This isn't one of our normal cases, Vega.
This is you.
Cops deal in life or death every day.
Occupational hazard.
I know that better than anyone.
Listen...
I've been probing my brain.
Trying to access that part of my memory, to just remember something.
Anything.
I don't.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
But this would be.
You would be.
I should do this alone.
Wynn is unarmed, in a room full of guards.
Besides, I took him down once.
I can do it again.
If I'm late for work again, you're gonna have to call my boss for the last hour with my food.
I better get a refund.
I am not paying for cold moo shu.
60 years ago, companies outsourced all this stuff abroad.
Killed the working class, causing incarceration rates to skyrocket.
Now, we give the working class their jobs back, only this time, behind bars, for two cents on the dollar.
Doesn't seem right.
I'll save my crocodile tears for the victims and their families.
We don't forget the victims, Detective.
These are our reminders of past victims, past crimes... life-changing mistakes.
It also helps them move on to more productive lives.
Because all it takes is an arts and crafts project.
I know you have history with Michael Wynn and I'll admit, he's not an easy case.
But he is trying.
We believe he may be about to commit a serious crime.
According to data patterns in our Hawk-Eye system.
Right.
According to data patterns in the Hawk-Eye system.
That's impossible.
Michael is closely surveilled, like all our inmates, especially on our excursions.
You let them outside?
Well, it's good to know I'm busting my ass sending criminals to sleep away camp.
We go on weekly outings to restaurants, parks, museums.
Tomorrow, in fact.
That must be how he gets to you.
Shall we?
Detective Vega.
Heard you might be stopping by for a visit.
I'm touched.
Don't be.
Who's he?
New partner?
Oh, I'm jealous.
We're here on business.
Well, I thought you just missed me.
I do.
Especially your Christmas greetings.
Decided to give that up.
Changed man, Detective.
Really?
'Cause something tells me I've been on your mind.
Not really.
Sometimes, late at night,
- when I'm...
- Go ahead.
Finish the sentence.
See if the feeling's mutual.
So you're here to flirt.
And reminisce.
About the night I took you down.
Remember that?
Your face in the pavement.
My knee in your chest.
Good times.
You're digging up ancient history.
Do your boys here know about our history?
That you got beat up by a former high school cheerleader?
People here just care about the present, Detective.
The here and now.
Is that why you want revenge?
Put a hit out on me to get back the respect of your friends inside?
I keep the past where it belongs.
Are you finished here, Detective?
Chow time.
Stick around.
I got all the time in the world.
It was nice catching up.
Good job.
Housebroken.
Like a poodle.
Vega, watch out!
Guards!
That's two out of three.
Want to go best out of seven?
She set me up.
She set me up!
Vega, this isn't over!
You hear me...?
You baited him.
He attacked me, Ms. Winter.
And from the looks of it, he lost his field trip privileges.
Who put this here?
I don't know.
Prisoners are allowed to put things here anonymously.
It... could have been anyone over the past ten years.
Vega, what is it?
- Excuse me, please.
- What's wrong?
You got Wynn.
They won't let him go on any more excursions, it's over, right?
Wynn's not the killer.
What?
How do you know that?
Because I think I know why I get killed.
It's not Wynn.
This watch...it was my dad's.
He was wearing it when he was murdered 17 years ago, but it was never recovered.
The ticking sound from my vision.
Exactly.
It must all be connected.
Yeah, but connected how?
Trying to find the guy who killed my dad is gonna get me killed.
Maybe he's in this place.
Or was.
We should get Akeela to run the names of prisoners and alumni.
Yes, but there might be something better than names.
Like faces.
Back so soon?
Recordings of Beta Precrime visions.
You said that you could poke around.
I need access to them.
If they did exist, where would they be?
I told you, the feds mopped up when Precrime fell.
Maybe FBI, maybe D.I.A.
Wait-wait, D.I.A.?
Defense Intelligence.
Blake.
He has a meeting there, some deputy director.
If they still have recordings of my father's murder,
I could catch his killer.
Wait, no.
You said yourself that looking for your father's killer might be what gets you killed.
Yeah, and if it helps me catch the guy, then it's worth the risk.
What if it's not just you?
At risk?
He's right.
The public never heard of Beta Precrime.
If you go asking questions, someone's gonna wonder how you know.
Do you trust me?
Then trust me.
What happened to letting Lieutenant Blake handle the politics, Detective?
I'm learning to multitask, Mr. Director.
Besides, this place fascinates me.
So much history.
If only you could talk about it.
Well, you should come work for us one day.
Then you could be part of creating your own history that you can't talk about.
Watch it.
Please, sit down.
Much as I would like this to be a social call, my reason for asking you here is a serious one.
I can't give you too many details, but there's intelligence that suggests a terrorist attack is imminent.
Foreign?
Domestic?
What we know for certain is the group is decentralized.
We think it could be the same people who bombed the N.I.H.
Took down the Monument.
But no group was ever pinned for that attack.
Not officially.
But two words keep popping up: "Memento mori."
- Latin.
- Yeah.
For "Remember you will die."
Oh, they sound friendly.
You think Hawk-Eye can help?
Well, it seems to be the best we have these days.
Computers are the most accurate predictors of future threats that we have left.
Since Precrime.
You said it.
But of course, we wasted that.
On what?
Stopping murders?
No, by missing the bigger picture.
For six years, the three Precognitives saw every murder in D.C. before it happened.
When it turned out the system wasn't foolproof, we gave up.
The next year, 4,000 people died in the bombing on the Mall.
And they would've seen it.
If we'd been smart enough to keep them.
Instead, we set them free.
And no one knows where they are now?
Sir...
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to cut this short.
- Something's come up.
- Of course.
You said six years?
That's how long the Precrime program ran.
Officially.
I heard rumors there was beta testing at least a year before the public knew.
They were seeing murders that no one ever tried to stop.
Uh, Vega, the man is busy.
Walk out with me.
The existence of Beta Precrime was top secret, Detective.
If the public found out that the federal government had been predicting murders that they never stopped...
There'd be a scandal.
Understandably.
Which no one wants.
And what is it you want?
Justice.
While the D.I.A. was testing Precrime's accuracy, no one was ever prosecuted for the murders the Precogs saw.
If those visions are still archived somewhere,
Metro can change that.
Cold cases.
My father was murdered that year.
Vega...
Oh, it's okay, Lieutenant.
We all got into this business for a reason.
I wish I could help, Detective.
But the Precrime vision archives were destroyed when the Supreme Court ruled the program unconstitutional.
These days, the murder visions only exist in one place.
Where?
Inside the Precogs' heads.
But good luck finding one.
The vision is still in my head?
And according to Blomfeld, all other records have been destroyed.
I'm sorry, but it's been too long.
If I still had that memory,
I would remember it.
Right, Wally?
Not necessarily.
What?
Over time, connections break down in the inferior temporal cortex and we lose the ability to access our memories.
- We forget.
- Correct.
However, some trace of the memory still exists as a pattern of neural connections deep in the hippocampus.
Exposed to the right stimulus, those neurons light up.
- The right stimulus?
- Through BIMR.
Brain Imaging Memory Recall.
"BIMR" For short.
It takes a specialized piece of equipment to scan those memories.
And could we find one of those machines around?
Yes.
Where?
Under the stairs.
I offered to take it off the program's hands early in the trial process, so they never had a chance to destroy it.
Wally, if you knew you could access my old visions, why didn't you tell us?
You didn't tell me Vega's father was the victim.
Besides, there's some, uh... discomfort involved.
Well, it can't be worse than what Dash has been through already.
There are ways.
- Forget it then.
- No.
Let's just do it.
But that's not the hard part.
Your visions from the days of Precrime were formed as part of a symbiotic neural link with your twin brother.
Each brain was just one half of the whole.
That means we can't even access those memories without...
- Arthur.
- Yes.
And visual stimulation... pictures, home video from you, Vega, of your father.
I can get those easy.
But I can't get Arthur.
He won't help us.
Sure, he will.
As long as the price is right.
No, not this time.
Why?
What's different?
Careful.
He cheats.
I'm certain the guy on your left is wanted by Interpol.
Please don't arrest him.
Why?
He has all the chips.
Not for long.
What's this about?
Agatha's wrong, Arthur.
My brother would make a lousy spy.
He knows me.
He knows I couldn't betray him like that.
Then that settles it.
I'll stake my life and freedom based on my brother's gut.
I'm gonna need you too.
Because I can't find the person who killed my father without your help.
Your father?
It happened before Precrime started, when you three were still in training.
Sorry to hear that.
You guys never knew your father.
Terrific role model.
Dumped my mom before we were born.
Well, mine was a good cop and even better father.
He was home every night even though he worked double shifts.
The day he died, I hurt him.
I know I did.
Families fight.
I've heard.
And what makes you so warm and fuzzy anyway?
Are you really asking me that?
Ten years in a milk bath, I know.
But it's not like your brother had it any easier.
I've seen things he hasn't.
I would never do anything to hurt Dash.
Or any of you.
I think you know that.
What does your gut say?
That you have a good chance of ending up dead very soon.
Cash me out.
Only because it's your damn birthday.
Arthur, you remember Wally.
Arthur.
So good to see you.
You're the guy who used to do my nails.
Knock it off.
Let's just do this.
It's, uh, an optogenetic-based brain-imaging memory recall device.
It looks for ion channel...
Try it again.
Like I'm six.
Strap you both into that thing and mine your brain for the vision.
Mine, like dig?
Sure, why not?
Coming?
Thank you.
Anytime.
Never again.
You two always worked more smoothly with a little lubricant-- dopamine, opioids.
Vodka's the best I got.
What, no tonic?
You'll also need these... if you've grown attached to your teeth.
Here comes the pinch.
What we're looking for are patterns-- specific neural circuits in their brains that code for memories of your dad.
That's why we show them pictures, home movies, recordings of his voice.
I, Hamilton Vega take thee, Lily Vega to be my lawfully wedded wife.
Three, two, one, blow!
Come on, put the camera down.
Come on, let's cut the cake.
They're not responding yet.
How much longer can they take this?
I don't know.
Their memories are-are so degraded, they're not remembering your dad.
He used to whistle this to me.
Hang on, I'm getting something.
It's the whistling.
It's-it's sparking something, an old vision.
Are you sure you want to see this?
Yes.
Oh, my God.
From everthing I found Dina Winters is a saint
ALU Person of the Year,
Luxor genius grant.
You sure she's your guy?
She killed my father in cold blood.
I saw her do it, we both did.
Well, they didn't have a history that I can see.
She was into drugs, though.
Her earlier years.
I count three possession charges the same year your father died.
What about this guy?
Any facial matches?
What do we know about him?
Just that he'd make a terrible eyewitness.
Can you swipe that off, please?
Sorry.
She just doesn't seem like the same person.
People will surprise you.
So how do we bring her down?
I confront her.
Record the whole thing with my lenses, get her to confess.
And if that doesn't work?
You saw a vision of her shooting me too, right?
If I can't nail her for my father's murder,
I'll get her for attempting mine.
No.
No way.
It's too dangerous.
I won't let you.
It's the only way.
She saw me take my father's watch.
She could run, she could get away.
You could die.
I think you should do it.
She needs to do it.
I love that you care, and I'm thankful for what you and your brother did for me, but this is something I've been living with for a long time.
I need to do this, Dash.
Then I need to come with you.
Lara?
Where are you going?
I was just headed out.
Rico, go.
Uh, Mom, I really have somewhere to go.
I'm not just leaving to leave.
I still miss him, too, baby.
You ever think about the person who did it?
For years...
I used to fanaticize about everything I would do to them.
How much I would give to spread the hurt.
To make them feel it, too.
But you got over it?
Let's just say that I'm happy i never found them.
I got to go.
They're chocolate.
Dulce de leche frosting-- your favorite.
Save me one.
You don't have to do this.
If you think that, you don't understand.
I was embarrassed when my father wore his uniform and dropped me off at school that day.
I told him to drop me around the block.
And I'd just walk.
That's not a good enough reason to get yourself killed.
Don't worry.
I ditched the jersey.
We can change the future, right?
Sometimes it's the past that's harder to escape.
Vega?
Don't lose yourself in there.
Detective Vega.
Kind of late to be making house calls.
I'm pretty sure you recognize this.
Um, I'm not sure what you mean.
Isn't that the watch you took from my clinic this morning?
No, it's the watch you took off my father's body after you killed him.
You're recording this, I assume?
With one of those nifty A.R. devices?
I work with criminals, remember?
You are a criminal.
You're a murderer.
The-the person who... murdered your father was a junkie.
Someone who couldn't see past her next fix.
Stop pretending like you're talking about someone else.
And one stupid night, when she was so hopped up on heroin she couldn't see straight, she... did something terrible.
Something she could never take back--
You're talking about yourself!
Calm down, Vega.
Be careful.
That junkie...
It was you, admit it!
Vega!
It was you.
That night weighs on her... still.
And... no amount of good she's done has ever made it right.
But... she kept trying.
Keeps trying.
You got to turn your life around.
Because you got to have one.
You got to live.
He didn't.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Say it was you.
Please...
I-I have a family.
A son-
- I've changed.
I'm not that junkie in the alley anymore.
You expect me to buy that?
!
You would shoot me right now if you had the chance.
Where's your gun?
I have one for protection, but, uh--
Not another step!
Where's your gun?
!
The only person with a gun here is you!
You can't know how sorry I am.
It was the worst mistake I'll ever make.
Saying yes.
"Saying... yes"?
To the job.
You were hired?
Vega, look in the mirror!
Are you okay, Mom?
Bradford, put down my gun!
Bradford-- that's your name?
I'm Detective Vega.
Don't move!
Vega, look at his shirt.
Maybe you weren't the victim in my vision.
He was!
Bradford.
How about this?
How about I put my gun down first?
Okay?
- Okay...
- Stay back!
Bradford, a long time ago, your mom... did something she can't take back.
I won't make the same mistake.
You shouldn't, either.
This isn't the way.
Listen to her, honey.
Okay.
You're okay.
- You're okay.
- Are you okay?
!
Yeah.
Please, he-he didn't mean to--
Go upstairs, baby.
Before... you said someone hired you to kill my dad.
Who?
Lycon.
He was my dealer.
Some guys came to him.
Said to make it look like a mugging.
Which guys?
Who were they?
I don't know.
I never met them face to face.
But I will tell you everything I know.
Just... keep my son out of this.
Please?
Let this end with us.
An eyeless man?
Lycon, a longtime dope peddler in the Sprawl back when Deena was a junkie.
He might be the go-between for whoever hired her to kill my father.
No one's heard from him in years, but we figured with your connections...
If this is all you have to go on, it's pretty thin.
I'll look into it on my end.
Thank you, Arthur.
For this and for before.
I don't expect a thank you from you.
But an apology for slugging me in the mouth would be nice.
Why?
You deserved it.
Okay, then.
But next time?
I hit you back.
You know your way out.
I just need a little more time.
You know I'll help you with this Lycon thing.
Whatever you need.
Thanks.
But right now, I need to go home.
Vega?
When you get home, grab the chair.
Mom?
Happy birthday.
It's over.
Love From Bangladesh!
(man whistling, thunder crashing)
(thudding nearby)
(thunder crashes)
Anybody there?
(loud thud)
Hello?
(beeping)
(quietly):
Ah, shut that off.
(gun clicks)
No!
No!
No!
AGATHA:
Can you see it?
What am I looking at?
Our future.
Plans for a new containment system.
A milk bath, Arthur.
More advanced than the one that held us during Precrime.
This file's ten years old.
Because the program was abolished before they could move us into it.
"They"?
The feds.
Defense Intelligence Agency.
They had bigger things in mind for us than just stopping local murders in D.C.
Like National Security?
We were going to be their secret weapon.
But the project was halted when they set us free.
So that's a good thing.
Only if it stays that way.
This is what I've been seeing in my vision, Arthur, every day since Dash went back to the city and started working with that cop.
You asked me to stop helping them and I did.
That isn't enough.
What do you think I am?
A realist.
Unlike your brother.
She will betray us, Arthur.
You don't know that.
I see it.
What I see is ancient history.
Yes.
But when we're too blind to learn its lessons, history repeats.
Knew I'd regret giving you your own key, Mom.
Yeah, you probably should've thought that one through.
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.
Made your favorite.
Algae and palm frittata.
I can't.
Blake's giving a tour to some bigwig fed today.
Wants everyone at the precinct early.
Oh.
Maybe we could plan a little get-together for tonight.
You know, something simple.
Just friends and family?
I-I probably have to work late.
I love you.
You plan on going the whole day avoiding this.
If people will let me.
(indistinct chatter)
Happy birthday.
Where am I gonna put those?
In water.
With protein, I'm told.
I'm a cop, Dash.
Would you give flowers to Blake?
Well, I don't know him very well.
When is his birthday?
(sighs)
It's just I'm not,
I'm not big on birthdays.
What?
I love them.
Of course, I've only really had ten while technically conscious.
They're very nice.
Thank you.
Hey, Vega.
Your prom night?
You want to eat them?
Yeah.
I won't make that mistake again.
It's not your fault.
Vega and her dad share the same birthday.
Standing ten feet away.
Not in Boston.
Well, he should know why you're being a bitch.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
She's right.
It's been 17 years and sometimes it feels like it was just yesterday.
They never caught the guy who did it.
"17 years."
Think Precrime would've been up and running in eight months.
You would've seen it.
What?
Well, Precrime didn't start until September of '48 officially, but they had the three of us in secret testing a year before that.
For a year?
Narcissist incoming.
(indistinct chatter)
Detective Vega?
Henry Blomfeld, Deputy Director of the D.I.A.
Nice to meet you.
Her Hawk-Eye analyst, Dash.
Vega?
Walk with us?
Oh, it's okay.
Aw, you really should.
I'm fascinating company.
And I'm Akeela.
Pleasure.
(bracelet buzzing) Uh... uh-oh.
BLOMFELD:
I was just telling your lieutenant how impressed I was with Hawk-Eye's numbers this month.
He tells me you're partly responsible.
Thank you.
But Lieutenant Blake is just being modest.
It's all him...
and Hawk-Eye.
I don't think so.
You've got a clearance rate four times higher than average.
And all on Class One homicides.
You should take the victory lap, Detective.
You've earned it.
Mr. Blomfeld has invited us both to, uh, come by the agency this afternoon.
I told him we'd be honored.
Vega?
Thanks for the invitation, but you're the politician, Will.
I'll stick to catching the bad guys.
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Director.
You as well, Detective.
(ticking)
(scream)
VEGA:
Playitback.
Frame by frame.
(ticking)
What's that ticking sound?
Is that a clock?
It's all I could hear before the scream.
Okay, so it looks like the murder happens indoors.
I can't tell if it's day or night.
Two gunshots.
Messy, not calculated.
This happens in the moment.
No faces, no identifiable markings.
Hold it.
What is it?
It's a 2019 Red Clouds jersey.
It's the year that they changed their name.
It's almost impossible to get.
Believe me, I've tried.
Well, if it's rare, maybe we can get
Akeela to run the purchase records.
(clears his throat)
Wally, one more thing.
Dash said he was in the milk bath a year before they started Precrime.
Beta testing.
Working out the kinks.
We were instructed to record everything the Precogs saw, matching up their future visions to the deaths that followed.
But we weren't legally able to act yet.
Worst year of my life.
Mine, too.
Why?
What happened?
Oh, Vega-- If someone was murdered that year, and they didn't catch the killer, are those visions recorded somewhere?
(sighs)
Maybe, but-but I doubt it.
After Precrime ended, the feds pretty much stripped everything, covering their asses.
I can ask one of my old buddies, though, if you want me to poke around.
No, it was a long shot.
Thanks, Wally.
Oh, thank God.
Blake made me walk that stick-up-his-ass fed through Hawk-Eye's protocols.
All 49 of them.
I need some action.
Then you're in luck.
We need you to run a purchase.
Hit me.
Vintage 2019 Red Clouds jersey.
Very funny, Vega.
Am I missing something?
Yes, the whole concept of a birthday surprise.
Which I guess is impossible now that you're working with a--
(whispers):
a Precog.
I knew you'd been eyeing one, so I got it for your birthday.
You like?
Vega, you're the victim.
AKEELA:
Victim?
Is anyone angry at you?
Someone who might be holding a grudge?
Well, I was dismissive of my partner after he gave me flowers.
He might be insulted.
This isn't funny, Vega.
I'm a homicide cop.
The line of people pissed at me starts on the left.
Relax, they made 500 of those jerseys.
So?
So we didn't see my face in the murder vision.
which means, at worst, I have a one in 500 chance of being murdered in the next few days.
Well, don't pursue this and it's almost zero.
Dash, we're gonna stop this one just like we stopped the others.
I'm gonna go see Arthur.
In the meantime, burn that jersey.
What do you know?
Apparently someone doesn't want Vega to see her next birthday.
I'm not in the mood for glib today.
And I wasn't in the market for a fat lip.
Why didn't you call me when you got Vega's name?
Because of Agatha?
Because she saw a milk bath in her vision?
Because she found one.
The feds had plans for us when Precrime ended.
Maybe still do.
They set us free.
Minds change.
And hearts.
Even if that's true, nobody knows where we are.
Except Vega.
I didn't get another name.
Laura Vega-- that's all I know.
If you're lying to me...
You can always punch me in the face again.
I can't believe I bought you that jersey.
VEGA:
Forget about it.
Look, I was thinking...
I got you a death shirt for your birthday.
I'm the worst friend ever.
Akeela... any details from the murder vision?
Did anything pop?
I don't know.
Maybe.
What about these arrows?
That's the logo for Revive.
It's a program based out of Hayward Correctional Facility, headed up by Dana Winter.
They specialize in inmate rehabilitation.
Well, I'm guessing the rehab didn't take.
Okay, how long will it take you to pull up the files on the prisoners?
I was gonna grab some lunch.
Well, okay.
Let's see if anyone here has had Lara Vega as their arresting officer.
Oop!
Got a bite.
Michael Wynn.
Sprawl gang leader.
He was into selling Clarity.
And women.
Didn't much like being arrested by one.
You need to piss off.
You need to get...
Oh, I don't think so, little lady.
(grunting)
Ah!
Ah!
You're dead!
You hear me, you little...
Let's start there.
DASH:
Youreallythink Wynn could be the guy?
Y-You busted him almost six years ago.
Psychos have good memories and this one used to send me death threats every Christmas.
But he's in prison.
How does he get out to hurt you?
People on the inside have a lot of reach.
Anyway, that's what we're gonna find out.
Yeah, but see... what if that's just it?
What if going to see Wynn is what gets you killed?
This isn't one of our normal cases, Vega.
This is you.
Cops deal in life or death every day.
Occupational hazard.
I know that better than anyone.
Listen...
I've been probing my brain.
Trying to access that part of my memory, to just remember something.
Anything.
I don't.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
But this would be.
You would be.
I should do this alone.
Wynn is unarmed, in a room full of guards.
Besides,
I took him down once.
I can do it again.
(indistinct chatter)
If I'm late for work again, you're gonna have to call my boss for the last hour with my food.
I better get a refund.
I am not paying for cold moo shu.
WOMAN:
60 years ago, companies outsourced all this stuff abroad.
Killed the working class, causing incarceration rates to skyrocket.
Now, we give the working class their jobs back, only this time, behind bars, for two cents on the dollar.
Doesn't seem right.
I'll save my crocodile tears for the victims and their families.
We don't forget the victims, Detective.
These are our reminders of past victims, past crimes... life-changing mistakes.
It also helps them move on to more productive lives.
Because all it takes is an arts and crafts project.
I know you have history with Michael Wynn and I'll admit, he's not an easy case.
but he is trying.
We believe he may be about to commit a serious crime.
According to data patterns in our Hawk-Eye system.
Right.
According to data patterns in the Hawk-Eye system.
WINTER:
That's impossible.
Michael is closely surveilled, like all our inmates, especially on our excursions.
You let them outside?
Well, it's good to know I'm busting my ass sending criminals to sleep away camp.
We go on weekly outings to restaurants, parks, museums.
Tomorrow, in fact.
That must be how he gets to you.
Shall we?
Detective Vega.
Heard you might be stopping by for a visit.
I'm touched.
Don't be.
Who's he?
New partner?
Oh, I'm jealous.
We're here on business.
Well, I thought you just missed me.
I do.
Especially your Christmas greetings.
Decided to give that up.
Changed man, Detective.
Really?
'Cause something tells me I've been on your mind.
Not really.
Sometimes, late at night, when I'm...
Go ahead.
Finish the sentence.
See if the feeling's mutual.
So you're here to flirt.
And reminisce.
About the night I took you down.
Remember that?
Your face in the pavement.
My knee in your chest.
Good times.
You're digging up ancient history.
VEGA:
Do your boys here know about our history?
That you got beat up by a former high school cheerleader?
Hmm.
People here just care about the present, Detective.
The here and now.
Is that why you want revenge?
Put a hit out on me to get back the respect of your friends inside?
I keep the past where it belongs.
(buzzer sounds)
Are you finished here, Detective?
Chow time.
Stick around.
I got all the time in the world.
It was nice catching up.
Good job.
Housebroken.
Like a poodle.
Vega, watch out!
(shouts)
WINTER:
Guards!
(grunting)
That's two out of three.
Want to go best out of seven?
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
She set me up.
She set me up!
Vega, this isn't over!
You hear me...?
You baited him.
He attacked me, Ms. Winter.
And from the looks of it, he lost his field trip privileges.
Who put this here?
I don't know.
Prisoners are allowed to put things here anonymously.
It... could have been anyone over the past ten years.
Vega, what is it?
Excuse me, please.
What's wrong?
You got Wynn.
They won't let him go on any more excursions-- it's over, right?
Wynn's not the killer.
What?
How do you know that?
Because I think I know why I get killed.
VEGA:
It's not Wynn.
This watch-- it was my dad's.
He was wearing it when he was murdered 17 years ago, but it was never recovered.
The ticking sound from my vision.
Exactly.
It must all be connected.
Yeah, but connected how?
Trying to find the guy who killed my dad is gonna get me killed.
Maybe he's in this place.
Or was.
We should get Akeela to run the names of prisoners and alumni.
Yes, but there might be something better than names.
Like faces.
Back so soon?
Recordings of Beta Precrime visions.
You said that you could poke around.
I need access to them.
If they did exist, where would they be?
I told you, the feds mopped up when Precrime fell.
Maybe FBI, maybe D.I.A.--
Wait-wait, D.I.A.?
Defense Intelligence.
Blake.
He has a meeting there, some deputy director.
If they still have recordings of my father's murder,
I could catch his killer.
Wait, no.
You said yourself that looking for your father's killer might be what gets you killed.
Yeah, and if it helps me catch the guy, then it's worth the risk.
What if it's not just you?
At risk?
WALLY:
He's right.
The public never heard of Beta Precrime.
If you go asking questions, someone's gonna wonder how you know.
Do you trust me?
Then trust me.
BLOMFELD:
What happened to letting Lieutenant Blake handle the politics, Detective?
I'm learning to multitask, Mr. Director.
Besides, this place fascinates me.
So much history.
If only you could talk about it.
Well, you should come work for us one day.
Then you could be part of creating your own history that you can't talk about.
Watch it.
Please, sit down.
Much as I would like this to be a social call, my reason for asking you here is a serious one.
I can't give you too many details, but there's intelligence that suggests a terrorist attack is imminent.
Foreign?
Domestic?
What we know for certain is the group is decentralized.
We think it could be the same people who bombed the N.I.H.
Took down the Monument.
But no group was ever pinned for that attack.
Not officially.
But two words keep popping up:
"memento mori."
Latin.
Yeah.
For "remember you will die."
Oh, they sound friendly.
You think Hawk-Eye can help?
Well, it seems to be the best we have these days.
Computers are the most accurate predictors of future threats that we have left.
Since Precrime.
You said it.
But of course, we wasted that.
On what?
Stopping murders?
No, by missing the bigger picture.
For six years, the three Precognitives saw every murder in D.C. before it happened.
When it turned out the system wasn't foolproof, we gave up.
The next year, 4,000 people died in the bombing on the Mall.
And they would've seen it.
If we'd been smart enough to keep them.
Instead, we set them free.
And no one knows where they are now?
(door opens) AGENT:
Sir... (whispering)
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to cut this short.
Something's come up.
Of course.
You said six years?
That's how long the Precrime program ran.
Officially.
I heard rumors there was beta testing at least a year before the public knew.
They were seeing murders that no one ever tried to stop.
Uh, Vega, the man is busy.
Walk out with me.
The existence of Beta Precrime was top secret, Detective.
If the public found out that the federal government had been predicting murders that they never stopped...
There'd be a scandal.
Understandably.
Which no one wants.
And what is it you want?
Justice.
While the D.I.A. was testing Precrime's accuracy, no one was ever prosecuted for the murders the Precogs saw.
If those visions are still archived somewhere,
Metro can change that.
Cold cases.
My father was murdered that year.
Vega...
Oh, it's okay, Lieutenant.
We all got into this business for a reason.
I wish I could help, Detective.
But the Precrime vision archives were destroyed when the Supreme Court ruled the program unconstitutional.
These days, the murder visions only exist in one place.
Where?
Inside the Precogs' heads.
But good luck finding one.
DASH:
The vision is still in my head?
VEGA:
And according to Blomfeld, all other records have been destroyed.
I'm sorry, but it's been too long.
If I still had that memory,
I would remember it.
Right, Wally?
Not necessarily.
What?
WALLY:
Over time, connections break down in the inferior temporal cortex and we lose the ability to access our memories.
We forget.
Correct.
However, some trace of the memory still exists as a pattern of neural connections deep in the hippocampus.
Exposed to the right stimulus, those neurons light up.
The right stimulus?
Through BIMR.
Brain Imaging Memory Recall.
"Beemer" for short.
It takes a specialized piece of equipment to scan those memories.
And could we find one of those machines around?
Yes.
Where?
Under the stairs.
I offered to take it off the program's hands early in the trial process, so they never had a chance to destroy it.
Wally, if you knew you could access my old visions, why didn't you tell us?
You didn't tell me Vega's father was the victim.
Besides, there's some, uh... discomfort involved.
Well, it can't be worse than what Dash has been through already.
There are ways.
Forget it then.
No.
Let's just do it.
But that's not the hard part.
Your visions from the days of Precrime were formed as part of a symbiotic neural link with your twin brother.
Each brain was just one half of the whole.
That means we can't even access those memories without...
Arthur.
Yes.
WALLY:
And visual stimulation-- pictures, home video from you, Vega, of your father.
I can get those easy.
But I can't get Arthur.
He won't help us.
Sure, he will.
As long as the price is right.
No, not this time.
Why?
What's different?
♪ You've got those loud bitches ♪
♪ Loud bitches telling you lies ♪
♪ Don't listen to those girls ♪
♪ They're just snakes in disguise ♪
♪ You've got the truth coming to you ♪
♪ And you've got to see ♪
♪ Got to step up your game if you want to run with me ♪
♪ Prophecy, prophecy ♪
♪ Should have been dead by 18 ♪
♪ Oh, mercy me, I landed back on my feet... ♪
Careful.
He cheats.
(men chuckle)
I'm certain the guy on your left is wanted by Interpol.
Please don't arrest him.
Why?
He has all the chips.
Not for long.
What's this about?
Agatha's wrong, Arthur.
My brother would make a lousy spy.
He knows me.
He knows I couldn't betray him like that.
Then that settles it.
I'll stake my life and freedom based on my brother's gut.
I'm gonna need you to.
Because I can't find the person who killed my father without your help.
Your father?
It happened before Precrime started, when you three were still in training.
Sorry to hear that.
You guys never knew your father.
(chuckles)
Terrific role model.
Dumped my mom before we were born.
Well, mine was a good cop and even better father.
He was home every night even though he worked double shifts.
The day he died, I hurt him.
I know I did.
Families fight.
I've heard.
And what makes you so warm and fuzzy anyway?
Are you really asking me that?
Ten years in a milk bath, I know.
But it's not like your brother had it any easier.
I've seen things he hasn't.
I would never do anything to hurt Dash.
Or any of you.
I think you know that.
What does your gut say?
That you have a good chance of ending up dead very soon.
Cash me out.
Only because it's your damn birthday.
Arthur, you remember Wally.
Arthur.
So good to see you.
You're the guy who used to do my nails.
Knock it off.
Let's just do this.
It's, uh, an optogenic-based brain-imaging memory recall device.
It looks for ion channel...
Try it again.
Like I'm six.
Strap you both into that thing and mine your brain for the vision.
Mine, like dig?
Sure, why not?
Coming?
Thank you.
Anytime.
Never again.
WALLY:
You two always worked more smoothly with a little lubricant-- dopamine, opioids.
Vodka's the best I got.
What, no tonic?
WALLY:
You'll also need these... if you've grown attached to your teeth.
Here comes the pinch.
What we're looking for are patterns-- specific neural circuits in their brains that code for memories of your dad.
That's why we show them pictures, home movies, recordings of his voice.
MAN:
I, Hamilton Vega take thee, Lily Vega to be my lawfully wedded wife.
ALL:
Three, two, one, blow!
(clapping, cheering)
Come on, put the camera down.
Come on, let's cut the cake.
They're not responding yet.
How much longer can they take this?
I don't know.
Their memories are-are so degraded, they're not remembering your dad.
(Hamilton whistles)
He used to whistle this to me.
Hang on, I'm getting something.
WALLY:
It's the whistling.
It's-it's sparking something, an old vision.
Are you sure you want to see this?
Yes.
(gun fires)
(gun fires)
Oh, my God.
From everything I found, Dina Winter is a saint.
ALU Person of the Year, Luxor genius grant.
You sure she's your guy?
She killed my father in cold blood.
I saw her do it, we both did.
AKEELA:
Well, they didn't have a history that I can see.
She was into drugs, though.
Her earlier years.
I count three possession charges the same year your father died.
What about this guy?
Any facial matches?
What do we know about him?
Just that he'd make a terrible eyewitness.
Can you swipe that off, please?
Sorry.
She just doesn't seem like the same person.
People will surprise you.
So how do we bring her down?
I confront her.
Record the whole thing with my lenses, get her to confess.
And if that doesn't work?
You saw a vision of her shooting me too, right?
If I can't nail her for my father's murder,
I'll get her for attempting mine.
No.
No way.
It's too dangerous.
I won't let you.
It's the only way.
She saw me take my father's watch.
She could run, she could get away.
You could die.
I think you should do it.
She needs to do it.
VEGA:
I love that you care, and I'm thankful for what you and your brother did for me, but this is something I've been living with for a long time.
I need to do this, Dash.
Then I need to come with you.
(door opens)
LILY:
Lara?
Hi.
Hey.
RICO:
Where are you going?
I was just headed out.
Rico, go.
Uh, Mom, I really have somewhere to go.
I'm not just leaving to leave.
I still miss him, too, baby.
You ever think about the person who did it?
For years...
I used to fanaticize about everything I would do to them.
How much I would give to spread the hurt.
To make them feel it, too.
But you got over it?
Let's just say that I'm happy
I never found them.
I got to go.
They're chocolate.
Dulce de leche frosting-- your favorite.
Save me one.
(crickets trilling)
(sighs)
You don't have to do this.
If you think that, you don't understand.
I was embarrassed when my father wore his uniform and dropped me off at school that day.
I told him to drop me around the block.
And I'd just walk.
That's not a good enough reason to get yourself killed.
Don't worry.
I ditched the jersey.
We can change the future, right?
Sometimes it's the past that's harder to escape.
Vega?
Don't lose yourself in there.
(footsteps approaching)
Detective Vega.
Kind of late to be making house calls.
I'm pretty sure you recognize this.
Um, I'm not sure what you mean.
Isn't that the watch you took from my clinic this morning?
No, it's the watch you took off my father's body after you killed him.
You're recording this, I assume?
With one of those nifty A.R. devices?
I work with criminals, remember?
You are a criminal.
You're a murderer.
The-the person who... murdered your father was a junkie.
Someone who couldn't see past her next fix.
Stop pretending like you're talking about someone else.
And one stupid night, when she was so hopped up on heroin she couldn't see straight, she... did something terrible.
Something she could never take back--
You're talking about yourself!
Calm down, Vega.
Be careful.
That junkie...
It was you, admit it!
(screams) Vega!
It was you.
That night weighs on her... still.
And... no amount of good she's done has ever made it right.
But... she kept trying.
Keeps trying.
You got to turn your life around.
Because you got to have one.
You got to live.
He didn't.
(gasps)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Say it was you.
Please...
I-I have a family.
A son-
- I've changed.
I'm not that junkie in the alley anymore.
You expect me to buy that?
!
You would shoot me right now if you had the chance.
Where's your gun?
I have one for protection, but, uh--
Not another step!
Where's your gun?
!
The only person with a gun here is you!
You can't know how sorry I am.
It was the worst mistake I'll ever make.
Saying yes.
"Saying... yes"?
To the job.
You were hired?
Vega, look in the mirror!
Uh, are you okay, Mom?
Bradford, put down my gun!
Bradford-- that's your name?
I'm Detective Vega.
Don't move!
DASH:
Vega, look at his shirt.
Maybe you weren't the victim in my vision.
He was!
Bradford.
How about this?
How about I put my gun down first?
Okay?
Okay...
Stay back!
Bradford, a long time ago, your mom... did something she can't take back.
I won't make the same mistake.
You shouldn't, either.
This isn't the way.
Listen to her, honey.
Okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Are you okay?
!
Yeah.
Please, he-he didn't mean to--
(whispers):
Go upstairs, baby.
Before... you said someone hired you to kill my dad.
Who?
Lycon.
He was my dealer.
Some guys came to him.
Said to make it look like a mugging.
Which guys?
Who were they?
I don't know.
I never met them face to face.
But I will tell you everything I know.
Just... keep my son out of this.
Please?
Let this end with us.
An eyeless man?
Lycon, a longtime dope peddler in the Sprawl back when Deena was a junkie.
He might be the go-between for whoever hired her to kill my father.
DASH:
No one's heard from him in years, but we figured with your connections...
If this is all you have to go on, it's pretty thin.
I'll look into it on my end.
Thank you, Arthur.
For this and for before.
I don't expect a thank you from you.
But an apology for slugging me in the mouth would be nice.
Why?
You deserved it.
Okay, then.
But next time?
I hit you back.
You know your way out.
I just need a little more time.
You know I'll help you with this Lycon thing.
Whatever you need.
Thanks.
But right now, I need to go home.
Vega?
When you get home, grab the chair.

Back in the '80s, my mom forced us to take the most embarrassing family photos in human history.
Did we agree because we loved her?
Oh, God, no.
We did it 'cause she guilted us.
This is so brutal.
But one day when you abandon me in an old-age home and never visit, you'll look at these pictures and remember how much I loved you.
Now, everybody say "Mahalo."
Mahalo!
And her guilting wasn't just for family photos.
It was for family everything.
Baby, if you don't eat, then I have failed as a mother.
I'm gonna die one day, but have fun with your friends.
When I die, don't have a funeral.
I don't want to take up anybody's time.
And then there was her signature guilt move.
If we were driving and she didn't get her way, she'd jump out of the car and threaten to walk home.
Get back in the car, Mom!
We want to have a picnic with you, okay?
Yeah!
I'm so stoked to eat chicken salad on the ground!
Well, if that's what you want, then...
Yay!
Picnic!
Yep.
It was her guilt world, and we were just living in it.
Hey, where are the car keys?
We're gonna grab a bite before the movie.
Movie?
I thought we had plans to bedazzle all day.
I...
Think you might have dreamed that.
Well, it's possible, but we're all set up, so let's make those drab clothes sparkle, huh?
- Oh, no.
What is that?
!
- Oh, my God!
It's a harlequin clown riding a unicorn high-fiving a dolphin.
Duh.
Yeah...
I think we're gonna pass on the debazzler.
Okay, now you're just embarrassing yourself.
It's bedazzler, as in regular items become dazzled.
And if you don't want to do that,
I'll just join you at the movie.
- No way!
- Oh, my God!
Come on.
I hardly ever get to see you anymore, and you're both growing up so fast, and...
You did promise we'd spend the day together.
Again, that was a dream.
It'll be fun.
Afterwards, we can grab a bite, split a giant cookie, you can ride the little mall train if you're still into it.
Ain't no thang.
Okay, here is the thang.
No.
Wow.
I am being rejected by two people who were tethered to my body for nine months by a food cord.
That's right.
Everything I ate you got a tiny, mushed-up version of.
Everything!
I don't think that's how science works.
You know what?
Go.
I'm not even sad.
I'm great.
Aw, come on.
Not the little pack of tissues!
Mom tears are the worst tears ever!
Fine.
Well, if we have no choice...
Oh, that's so sweet!
And don't you worry.
I promise you won't even notice I'm there.
Hey, check out my new jacket.
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God!
It was may 11, 1980-something, and my dad was pumped to spend the day with his one true love... the Phillies.
Hello, wonderful family, who I'm not gonna be seeing for the next six glorious hours!
Wait.
Where are you going?
To the Phillies game with Vic.
You never told me that.
Did you mark it in the calendar?
You have a calendar?
Where's this calendar?
It's on my desk.
Wait... you've got a desk?
Where's this desk?
You can't go.
Erica and Barry have graciously invited me to see a scary/sexy teen-vampire movie.
Who is gonna watch the baby?
Is that me?
It is.
I told you...
I'm not the baby!
I'm a grown, adult man!
And could you please start this orange?
Come on, Bevy!
Can't the boy stay home alone for the day?
I mean, he is 11... or 14 or whatever.
No!
The last time I went out power-walking,
I came home and found him hiding in the broom closet.
See, that's on you, 'cause you bought a house with a ghost.
Again with the ghost.
There are no ghosts!
Sure.
People don't die with unfinished business.
Must be nice to live in your world.
Okay.
We're going to the ballgame.
Go get your glove.
My Michael Jackson glove or my Nintendo power glove?
Really?
And so, my dad took me to watch the Phillies play at old Veterans Stadium, a beautiful world-class arena... when it was built.
Now it was falling apart at the seams, but we loved it anyway.
Dad, I got to pee.
Well, the bathroom's right up there.
Go ahead.
You want me to go by myself?
Yeah.
Forget what your mother said.
You're not a baby.
Now stop acting like a moron and go!
But I didn't have the guts, so my dad took me, like the little moron baby I was.
The men's room at Veterans Stadium was a nightmarish hellscape of people and pee everywhere.
What's that?
It's a trough.
Aim for a cigarette butt and make a game of it.
But w-where's the dividers?
Where's the handle to flush?
!
Where's the dignity, man?
!
If you don't like it, use the stall.
Mother of mercy.
What happened in there?
It's on the walls.
It's on the walls.
Please hurry it up.
I feel weird being in here not doing anything.
In that moment,
I had what all men experience at one point or another... stage fright.
I couldn't go.
My mind said yes, but my bladder said no.
I'm done.
Let's get the hell out of here so I can breathe through my nose again.
While I was running away from my fears,
Barry and Erica were sitting through a real horror show, and I don't mean the movie.
So, which boy is lost?
His poor mother must be going insane.
- Shh!
- Shh!
Oh!
I snuck in some snacks.
Got microwave popcorn, some chips, and a beautiful tomato.
I don't want a tomato!
Well, it's the last day before it turns.
Somebody's gonna eat it.
This has been the best day.
Yeah.
It's a real shame it's over.
Oh, it doesn't have to be.
I'm gonna make us a dinner reservation at Red Lobster.
Now, it's not Lobstober or Sshrimptember or Clamuary, so you're gonna have to order carefully.
What the hell happened out there?
Mom happened.
Whew.
You know, she guilted us into hanging out with her again.
You know, it is seriously not normal for teenagers to spend this much time with their mothers.
I rode the train, Man!
I rode the tiny train!
Look.
She took a picture and everything!
Okay, I can't watch you suffer like this anymore.
Follow me.
I'm about to change your lives.
How?
I'm gonna teach you how to defeat your mother.
It's natural for teenagers to separate from their parents.
But your mother loves you so much, she'll never let that happen.
That's why it's my job to... why are you wearing that outfit?
You're gonna teach us how to fight Mom, right?
No!
I'm gonna teach you to combat her guilt.
Ohhhh!
That makes more sense.
Should I go change back?
Just focus on me.
He'll get what he gets.
If you've noticed, when your mom tries to guilt me, it doesn't work.
That's because of my simple mantra...
"It's not real.
Don't feel."
What's not real?
The pain she's in.
Her guilt and tears are just a manipulation.
Don't fall for it.
Pops, if your thing was so easy, we would have done it a long time ago.
Oh, you're right.
I'm just a silly old man.
I-I should just go home, ball up my socks, and go to bed.
- No, don't.
I'm sorry.
- Don't do that!
We love you!
It's not real!
Don't feel!
Wait.
That was just an act?
Yes!
My God, you're weak and soft!
Say it with me. "It's not real.
Don't feel."
It's not real.
Don't feel.
Louder!
It's not real!
Don't feel!
Not that loud.
She'll hear you, and then we're all in trouble.
As my brother and sister were learning to fight back,
I was battling the 64 ounces of mountain dew in my bladder!
Dad, I have to pee again.
What?
You just went!
All right, I'm not gonna sugarcoat this.
My bladder shut down.
There's too much pressure at the trough.
Well, why don't you use the damn stall?
Don't speak of the stall... ever!
Well, it's too late.
The bases are loaded.
I'm not taking you again.
So just go!
Isn't there some private executive washroom with scented soaps instead of a giant metal river of whiz?
!
When will the hand-holding end, already?
!
For once in your life, be a man.
You don't think I'm a man?
All right, let me answer that question with this question.
What Superhero is on your underwear right now?
I outgrew those months ago!
Uh-huh.
I'll show you!
I'll go!
Go!
Fine!
I'm going!
Good!
You're doing what I want you to do!
Sure, I was mad at my dad, but mostly I was mad at myself, 'cause he was right.
So I set out to prove my manhood once and for all, and the first step was going potty by myself!
Nope.
Excuse me.
Which way to the upper level?
I'm thinking the higher you go, the fancier it gets.
So I headed up to what I figured was the super-fancy 700 level.
Not fancy.
Not fancy.
I finally gave up and headed back to my seats.
Just one problem...
I had no idea where my seats were.
Oh, balls!
Early-bird dinner was over, and Erica and Barry had been with my mom for six straight hours.
She was going for seven.
Wow.
I am stuffed.
What do you say we go home and burn off some of these calories with a little bedazzling?
Ugh!
Make it stop!
It's too much time with you!
I'm sorry, but I'm done.
If spending time with your mother is some kind of torture, then I'll just walk home.
Stop the car.
And there it was, her signature guilt move... storming out of the car and making us beg her to come back.
Here I go.
I'll probably get flattened by a truck, not that you'd care.
Aw, man!
She's out of the car!
Now what do we do?
Nothing.
Remember what Pops said?
"It's not real.
Don't feel."
I'm walking!
We should just drive off and let her walk home.
You heard her.
She could be flattened by a truck!
She's not a squirrel!
We're 10 minutes from home.
She'll be fine.
I'm walking.
All right, we need to take a stand and drive away.
- Are you with me?
- I don't know!
Still walking!
I need you to look me in the eye and say you are with me.
I'm with you!
God save my soul, I'm with you!
I knew you'd come to your senses.
We're doing it!
This is really happening!
I've never felt so alive in my life!
As my brother and sister were flying high, my dad was crashing down to reality.
Damn it.
Where is he?
See, back before cellphones, getting lost was a much bigger deal.
I'm fine.
It's fine.
It's all gonna be fine.
S-so I'm hungry and alone and may never be rescued.
It's good times.
The only way to actually find someone was to shout their name really loud.
Adam?
!
When that didn't work, my dad decided to awkwardly approach anyone who even looked a little like me.
Tiny lady.
Sorry.
Meanwhile, the more I ran around, the more lost I got.
Luckily, my dad came up with the perfect plan to track me down.
Whoa, whoa.
Slow it down there, boss.
That's a restricted area.
Yeah, yeah...
I got separated from my son, and I need to make an announcement to the entire stadium.
Okay, that makes sense.
This kid of yours... what's he look like?
I don't know.
He's a boy.
He's normal-looking.
He's got hair, a face.
I-I don't look at him much.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, how old is this boy?
11.
Or...14.
Can I just go make my announcement?
!
Oh, yeah, sure.
And after, you want to visit the dugout or shower in the locker room?
Very funny.
Hey, how are your fielding skills?
You want to play shortstop?
Just know I will make it through that door.
Better yet, why don't I have two of my friends escort you to the V.I.P. Section?
My kid's in there!
While my dad had hit an all-time low,
Barry and Erica were riding high.
Dude, we did it!
For once, we didn't give in to her guilt!
I know!
We totally drove away!
I feel so exhilarated, like I just killed a man!
Exactly!
Wait.
What?
Pops, we did just like you said with Mom.
Way to go, kiddos.
I want to hear all about it.
You know that thing mom does when she storms out of the car and then you have to beg her to get back in?
Oh, yeah... the big guns.
Well, we left her on the side of the road like an old mattress!
Boom!
What?
Are you nuts?
!
You don't leave your mother on the side of the road!
Who does that?
That's exactly what you said to do.
That's not what I said at all!
Why are you making us feel guilty?
I thought you were on our side!
My God!
What have you done?
!
Everybody just chill, okay?
That's her.
She's fine.
Evening.
It was the old man!
He put us up to it!
They misunderstood my rhyme!
It doesn't matter.
Is our mom okay?
She's fine.
I gave her a lift.
Lucky for her, I was driving down old York Road and was temporarily blinded by the sunlight reflecting off of her bejeweled jacket.
Where is she?
In the back of my cruiser with a little pack of tissues.
She's pretty certain she failed as a mother.
I know this looks bad, but you have to understand she uses guilt to get her way.
So...
She's like every Mom.
Except in this case, you abandoned her on the side of the road.
Shame on you.
Shame.
Thank you for seeing me home safely, Officer.
It was very kind.
You must be a wonderful son.
Mom...
Bup-bup-bup.
I have one thing to say to you.
That was [Bleep] up.
Only one person felt worse than Barry and Erica... my dad.
He was so desperate to find me that he sought help in the most unlikely of places... a parking lot full of Philly tailgaters.
Hey.
You guys got an extra ticket you could sell me?
I-I got tossed out of the Stadium.
I need to get back in.
Why'd you get ejected, Chief?
Um, I got into it with a security guard because I lost my son.
In Veterans Stadium?
Damn, that is just some bad parenting right there.
I never let my little fella out of my sight.
Tell you what.
Let me C.B. The other camps around the stadium, see if anybody's seen your kid.
Wow.
You'd do that?
Well, t-thank you.
It's what Phillies fans do.
So, how old is he?
What does he look like?
Why's everybody need to know that?
!
Hey.
I-I'm kind of lost.
Could you please help me find my dad?
Of course we can help you find your dad.
Why don't you step over there with the other lost kids?
As I looked at that line of lost little tykes,
I knew I couldn't join them.
I finally had to man up and become the 11- or 14-year-old my dad wanted me to be.
No!
Not today!
I'm lost, I'm starving, and I still haven't peed, but I will survive!
As I was finally confronting the most disgusting bathroom in the world,
Erica and Barry were about to face the most emotionally manipulative mother in the universe.
Hey, Mama.
I don't think she heard you.
Do it again.
He-e-e-y.
Oh, stop it.
I heard you.
I'm just not answering.
We feel horrible.
And we made a little peace offering to show you how sorry we are.
It's a picture of you.
See?
You're smiling, like you used to before we ditched you on the side of the road like human trash.
Your shading and tones don't quite capture my loving essence, but I appreciate the effort.
Maybe you could teach us.
How does that sound?
We bedazzle for the rest of the day.
Well, that's a good first step, but it's gonna take a lot more than rhinestones and glitter to make up for what you did.
Name it.
Anything.
- I want huggies.
- Fine.
- And snuggles.
- On it.
- And kissies.
- Absolutely.
And nubbies.
Lots and lots of nubbies.
I don't know what that is, and I'm scared to find out, but sure.
We're gonna go set up the bedazzler.
We'll meet you upstairs.
And just like that, my mother realized that getting abandoned on the side of the road was the best thing that could have happened to her.
Mom, are you coming?
I'll be there in a minute.
It was the bottom of the ninth.
I was still lost, but at least I wasn't alone.
I guess I just really want to show my dad what I'm made of, you know?
In here.
Does that make sense?
Okay, you've done that three times.
I don't know what that means.
As I was getting annoyed with my new green friend,
Barry and Erica were bedazzling with all the colors of the rainbow.
What's all this?
Oh, just a bunch of bedazzmanian devils going crazy!
Blablaggablagah!
It's been a fun hour.
You know what?
We're out of silver studs.
I'm gonna go get some from my craft drawer.
Yes!
We need more.
This is so fun!
Help us.
I'm sorry.
You hurt her for real.
You got to pay the price.
But we bedazzled everything.
Look.
I even bedazzled my flyers Jersey, and, in some weird way, I think it looks amazing.
And what are nubbies?
What are nubbies?
!
She said "nubbies"?
Oh, you're way too old for that.
I'll talk to her.
Bevy, listen, the kids don't deserve all the blame for what they did.
I may have taught them how to stand up to your guilt.
That was you?
Thank you so much.
Thank you for this wonderful gift.
W-wait.
What's happening?
Y-you're not angry?
This is literally my dream come true.
Now they're under my thumb forever.
I get to decide how they live, who they marry, where they take me on vacation, and all because they left me on the side of the road.
Honey, you can't hold them hostage with guilt for the rest of their lives.
They're just gonna end up resenting you.
But...
What else am I supposed to do?
I'm their mom.
If it were up to them, they'd never spend time with me.
Have you ever wondered why they love hanging out with me so much?
'Cause I don't force them to.
Also, I'm pretty frickin' delightful.
You are pretty delightful.
And so are you.
Put the stud guns down.
You're free to go.
No, really.
We're having fun.
You're not.
You've done this long enough, and we're even.
But we're just trying to apologize for what we did.
No, I'm the one who needs to apologize.
I guilt you kids way too much.
It's just, uh...
When you were little, all you wanted to do was spend time with me.
And, you know, a Mom gets used to that.
You two will never understand how much it hurts when that goes away.
I that's just the wathings are right now.
You know, we really meant what we bedazzled.
We do love you.
I know.
Just no nubbies.
Deal.
While my mom had found common ground with Barry and Erica,
I still hadn't found my dad.
But we weren't out of options.
Back then, whenever you got lost, the last resort was always the same... meet at the car.
Of course, I had no idea where we were parked, so I had to wait until every single car was gone.
I was ready to give my dad hell.
I wanted to tell him how I survived on my own and proved him wrong.
I wanted to tell him I was a man.
I wanted to tell him that I didn't need him anymore.
But...
Instead, I did this.
I know.
You're safe.
You're safe.
I spent most of that day lost, but what I remember most is what I found.
I found out that I could do okay on my own, and my dad discovered he didn't want me to grow up too fast.
Hey, Ma.
Hi.
Back from another normal day.
Well, come into the nook.
It's "battle of the network stars."
Fonzie sure can throw a javelin.
That's the thing about parents... they always drive you crazy.
Oh.
Got a beautiful tomato if you're hungry.
Mom, enough with the tomato.
Someone's gonna eat this thing today.
But in a world where we all get lost sometimes...
- Stop!
Stop, Mom!
- Kissy shark!
Kissy shark!
- Stop!
Stop it!
- Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah!
There's nothing better than having people who love you so much, they never want to let you go.
No!
No, no, no!
Mom, mom!
Three...
Two...
Fire!
- Hey !
- Hey...
Wow!
What is that?
!
Ohoh!
You mean the shirt?
I'm going to the Phillies Game later with Dad
So, I bedazzled this as a joke just to drive him crazy.
I mean, I would never wear this to the game unless you think I can maybe wear it to the game.
You know, you shouldn't just wear it to the game,
I would wear it to school!
That's what I thought!
Thank you!
I mean this is a joke, but thank you!
(PRIEST PRAYING IN LATIN)

Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?
Not if what you're going to say will cause trouble for me in some way or another.
(SIGHS)
(CHURCH BELL TOLLING) 9:00 mass is over, girls.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
- Now.
- MAN:
Thank you.
- EILIS:
One moment, please.
- Excuse me.
WOMAN:
And some rashers and some cheese.
(BELL JINGLING)
Mrs Brady, what would you like this morning?
- Half a dozen rashers, please.
- Of course.
Eilis will get that for you now.
- I was next.
- And you still are.
- Yes?
- I need some shoe polish.
Shoe polish?
That's not really a Sunday item, now, is it?
These people need things for their dinner or their tea.
Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?
Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.
I'm sorry.
(MISS KELLY LOCKS DOOR)
Miss Kelly...
I hadn't forgotten.
Spit it out, whatever it is.
I'm away to America.
Whose idea was that?
Father Flood in New York arranged it.
Rose used to play golf with him.
He sponsored me.
And he found me a job and got me a visa.
Well, we won't be needing you back here.
I could work every Sunday till I go.
No, thank you.
- Your poor sister.
- My sister?
Well, mothers are always being left behind in this country.
But Rose, that's the end for her now, isn't it?
She'll be looking after your mother for the rest of her life.
I wish I'd written to Father Flood about you, Rose.
Me?
I have a job.
You had a couple of hours on a Sunday working for Nettles Kelly.
You shouldn't call her that.
I think it's quite a kind name.
Considering she's actually a terrible old witch.
Well, I don't want to talk about her any more.
Good.
They say it's hotter there in the summer and colder in the winter.
What in heaven's name will she do about clothes?
She'll buy them, Mother.
She doesn't want to be wasting her money on clothes.
She won't have much choice.
She'll be there for...
(LAUGHS)
- You look beautiful, Nancy.
- Thank you.
You look so beautiful.
It makes me despair of this place.
(LAUGHS) Why?
Well, you're the prettiest girl in County Wexford.
You should be able to choose any man you want and we're hoping that George Sheridan from the rugby club looks your way.
Do you think he might?
Of course he will.
I know you like him, Nancy, but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?
And those boys with their hair oil and their blazers.
- NANCY:
He has beautiful eyes.
- Mmm...
And he's going to come into a beautiful shop in the market square.
Why didn't you wear your blue dress?
Are you asking why I didn't make more of an effort?
I suppose cos I'm going away.
- Mind, now.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)
Come on.
- (♪ IRISH FOLK) - (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(BOYS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)
He's looked over here twice already.
He hasn't!
- He's walking over here now.
- He's not!
Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridan's doing?
(CLEARS THROAT) Would you like to dance?
(CHUCKLES)
(SIGHS)
ROSE:
Is that really everything you own?
Oh, Eilis.
I should have looked after you better.
You've bought most of the clothes in this case.
That's one of the reasons I'm going, cos I can't buy my own.
If it was just that, I'd spend every penny I had on you.
Gladly.
But I can't buy you a future.
I can't buy you the kind of life you need.
I know.
But you'll come see me there one day?
Yes.
And you'll look after yourself?
You don't have to worry about me.
And I'll come home to visit, won't I?
Cos I couldn't bear it if...
You haven't packed your shoes yet.
They'll take up a bit of room.
There.
(HORN BLOWING)
Oh!
I'm sorry.
(SIGHS)
Off.
Number one, bottom bunk, that's mine.
You're on the top.
This is hell.
- Never again.
- Never again to America?
The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.
I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.
Let's go for a smoke.
I don't.
Suit yourself.
I'll see you later.
Unless I find a nice man in First to smoke with.
It's good to see that not everybody's put off their dinner by the weather forecast.
It's supposed to be a rough one tonight, so none of the other passengers are eating.
A few spoonfuls of soup maybe, but not the mutton stew.

I'm sorry about the smell.
And the bucket.
Don't worry.
The whole boat stinks.
Even First Class.
I've just been thrown out of there, by the way.
The bathroom door was locked all night.
Oh, those bastards.
There.
Won't be very comfortable, but at least it's ours.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- GIRL:
Open the door.
- Feck off.
- Open the door right now.
- Do you hear me?
Fuck off.
If you'd been nice last night, we would have played fair.
- Now you've got no toilet.
- Get out of the bathroom.
You bastards.

Go on, you can use it.
I'm going to get us some water.
That's all you're allowed.

GEORGINA:
Are you going to live in America?
EILIS:
Yes.
GEORGINA:
You have papers and everything?
EILIS:
Yes.
And a job.
How'd you manage to arrange all that?
I didn't.
Someone did it for me.
A priest my sister knows.
And how do you feel about it?
How long do letters from Ireland take to arrive?
My sister Rose said she'd write straightaway.
They take a long time at first.
And then no time at all.
You have family in America?
Friends?
No.
You'll meet people easily enough.
Where are you gonna live?
Brooklyn?
- How'd you know that?
- Lucky guess.
Try to remember that sometimes it's nice to talk to people who don't know your auntie.
That's what it's like?
That's what it's like.
I haven't been sick for hours.
Nice, isn't it?
I'm very hungry.
That's why you haven't been sick for hours.
We'll eat tomorrow.
Or the day after.
Oh, dear.
We're gonna have to do something with you.
They'll put you in quarantine or something if you try and enter the country looking like that.
Nothing fancy.
You mustn't look like a tart.
Oh, well, looking like a tart isn't going to be a problem.
This doesn't look too bad.
My sister gave me that.
Wear it with this and... this.
(GUARD SHOUTS) Have your bags ready for inspection.
GEORGINA:
Don't look too innocent, though.
I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.
Perhaps a little eye liner.

MRS KEHOE:
Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, amen.
Amen.
I saw you had a letter today, Diana.
Any news?
Mr de Valera's had another operation on his eyes, she says.
He's been in Holland.
I don't want news I can read in a newspaper.
Anyway, we would describe Mr de Valera as politics, would we not, Mrs Kehoe?
And we do not like politics at the dinner table.
We don't.
It's not politics to talk about eye operations.
It is if the eyes belong to a politician.
And I don't like to talk about hospitals very much either.
Patty, did you have any luck with that cold cream?
No, Mrs Kehoe.
I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.
And I showed her the advertisement.
I don't want to have to travel all the way into Manhattan just for a jar of cold cream.
Maybe you could have a look in Bartocci's for me, Eilis?
Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.
She doesn't know that for sure, Mrs Kehoe.
She's only saying that Bartocci's is a better store than Webster's to get at Patty.
They're both very good and you girls are very lucky to be working there.
Eilis, from the look of you, you have greasy skin.
Is that right?
What do you do about that?
Just...
Well, I wash it, Mrs Kehoe, with soap.
There's nothing wrong with soap.
Soap was good enough for Our Lord, I expect.
Oh, and which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?
Does the Bible tell you that?
Our Lord was a man, anyway.
He didn't care about greasy skin.
- (CHUCKLES)
- Ladies, no more talk about
Our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.
The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis.
- Won't you, girls?
- BOTH:
Mmm-hmm.
(DINGS)
Hi.
- Good morning.
- Did you go out last night?
- Out, the opposite of in.
- No.
Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.
"What did you see, Dorothy?"
"I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis.
They filmed it in Ireland."
"Oh, I'm from Ireland."
"I know you are.
That's why I thought you might be interested."
Thank you.
(AIR HISSING)
Shouldn't be a moment.
Is it still hot out there?
I haven't been outside since this morning.
But I can tell that it might be very.
It just looks it.
It's warm, yes.
- (DINGS) - (AIR HISSING)
Thanks very much.
Remember, if people like it here, they'll come back, so you treat every customer as if she's a new friend.
- I'll try.
- It's not a matter of trying.
It's what you have to do.
Do you try to wear panties every day?
No.
I mean, I don't...
I don't try.
I just put them on.
You see what I'm saying?
Yes.
Good.
CUSTOMER:
Can we get another side of toast, please?
MAN:
Slice up some hot dogs.
They want 'em sliced down the middle.
(♪ BE COOL AKA KEEP COOL ON RADIO)
Sorry.
Could I have the bill, please?
I hope that when I go through the Pearly Gates, the first sound I hear is you asking me for the cheque in that lovely Irish brogue.
(SIGHS)
PATTY:
Diana?
Have they told you a date for the nylon sale yet, Eilis?
Never had a Bartocci's girl living here.
Might get some inside information.
I haven't been told anything.
- I bet you wouldn't let on if you had.
- She's that sort.
More loyal to her bosses than to her friends.
- Like a Red spy.
- Oh, dear God.
I'll thank you to keep His name out of a conversation about nylons.
He might be everywhere, but he's certainly not in Bartocci's on sale day.
Sorry, Mrs Kehoe.
I was glad to see you finally got some letters from home today, Eilis.
Did I?
I forgot to check.
They'll still be there after dinner.
Sorry.
ROSE:
Dear Eilis.
It's hard for me to believe that you're reading this in America, thousands of miles across the sea.
The big news here is that since you left,
Mammy has stopped shopping at Nettles Kelly's.
As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh and she overcharged for everything...
- (SNIFFLES)
- And she's awful.
MARY:
I haven't told her to her face.
There's no need.
She knows that she overcharges and her bread's not fresh.
ROSE:
We talk about you every evening, of course.
We want to know everything.
I'm sure you're busy, but even if your letters were 200 pages, they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.
(SOBBING)
Take care of yourself.
Love.
Is it your time of the month?
So what is it?
Take some time off now.
Go and sit in the staff room.
(DOOR OPENS)
I'm so sorry, Eilis.
This is all my fault.
I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.
Franco Bartocci says you're doing great here.
Ma Kehoe says you're the nicest lodger she's ever had.
- What?
- "Ma Kehoe"?
Don't ever call her that to her face.
(CHUCKLES)
I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.
I've enrolled you in a night class, for book-keeping.
Brooklyn College.
It'll be three nights a week and I've paid your tuition for the first semester.
- Why?
- Why?
Not thank you?
Sorry.
Thank you.
But why?
Well, I was amazed that someone as clever as you couldn't find proper work at home.
I've been here too long.
I forget what it's like in Ireland.
So when your sister wrote to me about you,
I said the Church would try to help.
Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.
I wish that I could stop feeling that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.
All I can say is that it will pass.
Homesickness is like most sicknesses.
It'll make you feel wretched and then it'll move on to somebody else.
Now, Taylor v. Standard Gas Company is one of the most important corporate cases decided in the Supreme Court in the last 20 years.
This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock Doctrine, so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.
In public utility integration proceedings alone, literally thousands of investors may be affected by its application.

It all tastes of sawdust.

Eilis, Father Flood told me about your Christmas plans.
Oh, you're not serving lunch to the old fellas who've nowhere to go, are you?
He asks us every year.
We always say no.
Eilis, you're a saint.
They smell awful.
Sheila knows how they smell because that's where she goes husband hunting.
(LAUGHING)
It's a marvellous thing you're doing, Eilis.
A Christian thing.
I wish there were more like you.
WOMAN:
In you come.
How many are we expecting?
We had a hundred last year.
There may be more this.
- EILIS:
Are they all Irish?
- FATHER FLOOD:
All Irish.
Why don't they go home?
If there's nothing there for clever young girls such as yourself, there's gonna be even less for men like these.
Some of them have been here 50 years.
They've lost touch with everyone.
Lovely.
Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

Now, Miss McAdam is leaving us.
She's going to live with her sister in Manhattan.
She has the best room in the house, the basement, and it has its own entrance.
Now, I can only let a certain kind of girl stay there.
Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.
Although I will admit, God did give Miss McAdam an advantage when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.
No, no, you're a pretty girl, Eilis, but you're sensible.
So, you're having the room and that's that.
Will the other girls not mind?
Oh, I expect so.
What don't they mind?
Girls, you'll take Dolores to the dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?
There's a dance?
MRS KEHOE:
At the parish hall.
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.
Um...
Patty and I aren't going this week.
We're going to see a movie instead.
Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.
I would, very much.
There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.
Yes, surprising, isn't it?
You'd think it'd be the other way round.
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
Of course, you would be welcome to join us, Dolores.
So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.
So you both miraculously found boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?
Well, I hope you have more luck with these than you did with the last few.
- Will you be going, Eilis?
- Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
Well, you can take Dolores, then.
Of course.
(♪ IRISH FOLK)

There's nobody here.
How are we supposed to get a fella if there's nobody here?

- Oh.

Would you like to dance?
Are you here with that guy, the one who was teaching you to dance?
- No.
- So would you dance with me?
I'm not sure he taught me anything.
Doesn't matter.
Secret is to look as though you know what you're doing.

Come on.

Where do you live?
- Clinton Street.
- Yeah?
That's on my way home.
Can I walk you?
I'm going to say yes and then I'm going to tell you why.
So I don't get the wrong idea?
I suppose so.
Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?
- You don't know her?
- (CHUCKLES) I do.
She lives in my boarding house and she's awful.
If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.
- You'd be rescuing me.
- I get it.
I'm not Irish.
You don't sound Irish.
- I need to make this clear.
- (CAR HORN HONKING)
No part of me is Irish.
I don't have Irish parents or grandparents or anything.
I'm Italian.
Well, my parents are, anyway.
So what were you doing at an Irish dance?
Don't the Italians have dances?
Yeah, and I wouldn't wanna take you to one.
They behave like Italians all night.
- What does that mean?
- Oh, you know.
No.
Hands.
Too many of them?
I guess it could seem that way if you was a girl.
Listen...
I want everything out in the open.
I came to the Irish dance... because I really like Irish girls.
And I was the only one who would dance with you?
Oh, no, it wasn't...
Oh, so you danced with loads of others?

I'm studying book-keeping.
You wanna be a book-keeper?
Well, I want to be an accountant one day, but, yes, book-keeping first.
- Wow.
- Mmm.
Is that difficult?
I'm talking too much.
Tell me about plumbing.
You know enough about plumbing already.
I don't know anything.
You know that taps drip and that toilets get blocked and that's all you need to know.
I mean, I don't know anything about book-keeping.
Well, there's a lot to it.
There's all the maths, of course, but that's not so complicated.
The double-entry system, that takes a while to get used to.
And we study company law too and that terrifies me.
So we had to read about an insurance company that went bankrupt in the 1930s and all the legal issues that went along with that.
She plays golf and she's really good at it and if she'd been at the dance last Saturday, then I don't think you'd have looked at me twice because Rose is beautiful.
I'm worried.
You haven't eaten anything.
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Too busy talking.
What is the matter with you girls now?
Nothing is the matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.
Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?
Eilis has a young man?
We didn't know.
She won't say anything about it.
And why should she to you awful gossipmongers?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Anyway, I met him on Saturday night when he called for Eilis, and he's a gentleman.
Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs Kehoe?
We know he's quite nice-looking.
Didn't like his shoes much.
What on Earth is wrong with his shoes?
- They were a funny colour.

Otherwise, it's too long to wait.
I wanna ask you something and you're gonna say,

I don't really know him well enough.
"We only been out a couple of times."
Oh, it's nothing so bad.
It's just something that most guys, they...
Please just ask.
You're beginning to terrify me.

Will you come for dinner and meet my family sometime?
That's it?
I'd love to.
You like Italian food?
Don't know.
I've never eaten it.
It's the best food in the world.
Well, why would I not like it?
You're in a good mood, huh?
Yes.
Why?
It's just...
I like how you're being.
I don't know the word, when you go along with everything.
- Amenable.
- Yeah?
Amenable?
OK, so while you're being amenable, can we go see a movie this week when you're not in night class?

It's colder in Ireland?
Oh, no, it's colder here.

But you have heating, heating everywhere.

You're like a different person.
How did you do it?
Maybe I can pass some advice on to the next poor girl who feels that way.
I met somebody.
An Italian fella.
Oh, no.
I'm not passing that on.
I'd rather have them homesick than heartbroken.
Does he talk about baseball all the time?
- Or his mother?
- No.
Then keep him.
There isn't another Italian man like him in New York.

I suppose the most important news is that I have a boyfriend.
He isn't as important as Bartocci's and my night classes, I know that, but I want to tell you everything that's going on.
Please don't mention it to Mammy, though.
You know what she's like.
He's decent and kind, and he has a job and he works hard.
We go to the cinema on Wednesdays and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.
I think of you and Mother every single day, but Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here
I didn't have before I met him.
My body was here,
- (SOBBING) - but my life was back in Ireland with you.
Now it's halfway across the sea.
So that's something, isn't it?
Oh, and I'd better warn you about Frankie.
- He's the little one?
- Yeah, he's eight going on 18.
I mean, he's nice and he's smart, but he's been talking and he's talking about all the things he's gonna say to you.
- What sort of things?
- We don't know.
It could be anything.
I mean, I tried to pay him money to go out and play ball with his friends and my dad, he threatened him, but I think he's looking forward to causing trouble, so much so he'll happily take a beating.
This is us here.
You ready?
Hey, how did you learn to eat spaghetti like that?
- I've been taking lessons.
- Lessons?
Like in a class?
You can do that?
Maybe I could teach it.
No, no, Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me cooked me some spaghetti and made me try and eat it without making a mess.
So what do you eat in Ireland?
Just Irish stew?
Not just.
We eat...
So, first of all, I should say that we don't like Irish people.
- MR FIORELLO:
Hey, watch it.
- MRS FIORELLO:
Frankie.
What?
We don't.
That is a well-known fact.
Why, Frankie?
Cos a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up and he had to get stitches, and because all the cops around here are Irish nobody did anything about it.
There's probably two sides to it.
I might have said something I shouldn't.
You know, I can't remember now.
No, because they beat you up.
Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.
No, they just had red hair and big legs.
All right, up.
- Ow!
- Excuse us.
(ALL CHUCKLING)
All I can say in his defence is he's the only one of us who'll get a college education.
If he can keep his mouth shut.
So, Tony tells me you go to college.
Oh, just night classes.
I want to be a book-keeper.
I like working in the shop well enough, but I don't want to be there forever.
I'm sorry, Eilis.
I'm an idiot.
I'm a rude idiot.
(ALL LAUGHING)
So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbets Field when the season starts?
You like baseball?
He never mentioned the Dodgers?
Not even once?
MR FIORELLO:
Tony, what's the matter with you?
You wanna know why?
Too much of this.
(MIMICS KISSING)
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbets Field if you wanna see him in the summer.
They're that important to you?
Put it this way, if our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants,
- it'd break my heart.
- MAURIZIO:
Mine too.
She's not laughing, Tony.
Think it's too late.
- She's a Yanks fan.
- (ALL PROTESTING)
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?
She's a Yanks fan.
I love you.
I...
Thank you for the evening.
It was lovely.
Oh!
Sorry.
I'd finished.
Sheila, can I ask you something?
Why aren't you married?
Because my husband met somebody else and left me.
Oh...
I'm sorry.
And, well, would you get married again?
- Has somebody asked you?
- No.
Not really.
I won't ask what that means.
Would I get married again?
No, I wanna be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding house forever.
Of course I do.
That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.
I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom while some bad-tempered fella with hair growing out of his ears reads the newspaper on the toilet.
Then I'll wish I was back here talking to you.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
TONY:
Eilis!
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were coming.
Yeah, I know.
I thought you were gonna think that.
That's why I wanted to be here no matter what.
- I need to say something to you.
- Can you...
Can we just talk about something else until we get to Mrs Kehoe's?
- It's not...
- Please.
So...
Ten minutes before I'm supposed to meet you and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.
- Yeah.
- (CHUCKLES)
Even if you're thinking of inviting me in for a coffee,
I'd have to say no for your sake.
So how did you fix it in 10 minutes?
I didn't.
I spent the whole 10 minutes explaining to the lady
I had to be somewhere and I'd be back, and she don't wanna let me go.
So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?
- Oh...
- (LAUGHS)
Well, what's the difference between six inches of sewage and a foot?
Will you let me say what I want to say?
I don't think you'll mind.
OK.
You remember that after I had dinner at your house, you told me you loved me?
Well, I didn't really know what to say.
But I know what to say now.
I have thought about you, and I like you.
And I like being with you.
And... maybe I feel the same way.
So the next time you tell me you love me, if there is a next time...
I'll say I love you too.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Holy shit.
Excuse my language, but I thought we were having a different kind of talk.
Can I go home now?
You love me?
Yes, but don't ask me anything else, and don't talk about our kids being Dodgers fans.
What, you want kids who like the Yankees?
- Tony, please, don't push me.
- All right.
I'm sorry.
ROSE:
Dear Eilis.
Thank you so much for the nylons.
The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.
It seems everything is so exciting and new compared to here.
I can't wait for you to show it all to me one day.
Oh, Eilis, you know I'm by your side, even when I'm not.
(CHILDREN PLAYING)
Well...
You're marvellous, that's all I have to say.
It looks to me as if you didn't just pass those exams.
No.
You flew through them.
I can't remember the last time anyone came in here with good news.
I've saved some money.
I'll be able to pay for next year's tuition and pay you back for last year.
One of my parishioners paid.
He needed to do something for mankind and I won't tell you why.
He's not out of the woods yet either, so he can cough up for next year, too.
I'd love to know what sort of woods he's in.
Yes, I'm sure you would, but you won't hear it from me.
(CHUCKLES)
Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.
You're not the miserable young girl who wanted to go home last winter.
It seems like years ago.
Now, I think this is the first time any girl of mine has ever passed an exam while living here.
- Have you told Tony yet, Eilis?
- Of course.
And is he taking you out to celebrate?
We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.
- Oh, boy.
- What does that mean?
Do you have a bathing costume?
- No, I was going to...
- Do you have sunglasses?
- No.
- You need sunglasses.
I read that if you don't have them on the beach this year, people'll talk about you.
And what exactly will they say, Sheila?
That's the thing, Mrs Kehoe.
You'd never know cos they'd never say it to your face.
Oh, dear God.
Diana's right, though, Eilis.
You need to think carefully about your costume.
It's the most Tony will ever have seen of you and you don't want to put him off.
You'll have to shave down there.
I'll give you a razor that'll do the trick.
You're all right there for the moment.
And most Italian men appreciate a fuller figure.
But watch yourself over the summer.
Black's too dark for your pale skin.
Let's see you in the green.
- (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) - (♪ ZING A LITTLE ZONG ON SPEAKERS)
Why didn't you tell me to put my costume on underneath my clothes?
I thought you'd know.
Right, I'm ready.
(WHISTLES)
- Tony.
- What?
Come on.
EILIS:
Dear Rose.
Thank you for your letter.
I was happy to hear about your golf tournament.
You must have been really pleased.
I still miss you and Mother and think about you every day, but I think I can say that for the first time since I've been in America
I'm really happy.
This has a lot to do with Tony.
At the weekend he took me to see the Brooklyn Dodgers, the baseball team he loves.
They lost, so he was annoyed.
But I've also started to look for office work too.
I had an interview this week at a textile firm here in Brooklyn.
Rose.
EILIS:
Who'd have thought there would be two book-keepers in the family?
Rose.
EILIS:
I'll soon be able to afford to come home and see you and Mammy.
Rose?
Rose.
Oh, my God.
(SOBS)
Rose!
Oh, Rose!
(CRYING)
One moment.
It was sudden.
I think perhaps she was ill, and she knew she was ill, and she didn't tell anybody.
- What'll happen?
- What can happen?
When will they bury her?
Tomorrow.
- Without me?
- Without you.
You're too far away, Eilis.
Why did I ever come here?
Rose wanted a better life for you.
She loved how well you were doing.
But I'll never see her again.
That's right, isn't it, Father?
I'll never see her again.
You know that I think you will.
And that she'll be watching over you every day for the rest of your life.
(GASPS)
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
Mammy?
(INDISTINCT)
I can't really hear you.
Well, the rain held off anyway.
And the whole of her golf club came, every single one of them.
We had a real houseful afterwards.
Are you still there?
Yes.
People really loved her, Eilis.
Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.
Nobody knew what to say to me.
When your daddy died, I said to myself that I shouldn't grieve too much because I had the two of you.
And then when you went to America,
I told myself the same thing because she was here with me.
But everyone's gone, Eilis.
I have nobody.
(SOBBING)
I can't bear it, Tony.
You wanna go home, I guess.
How would it be for you if I did go home?
I'd be afraid every single day.
Afraid that I wouldn't come back?
Yeah.
But home is home.
I'm not sure I have a home any more.
You're not going to work tomorrow, are you?
After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?
TONY:
This is it.
We're gonna build five houses here if we can and Mom and Dad, they're gonna have one cos Ma always wanted a house with a backyard.
We'll sell three.
And the other one, my brothers, they asked me if I wanted it and I said that I did.
So I guess what I'm saying is, you wanna live out here on Long Island?
I mean, I know it doesn't look like much right now, but all the land around here has been sold, so we wouldn't be on our own, and there'd be telephone cables and electricity, everything.
We're gonna set up a company.
A building company, the three of us.
And I'm gonna do the plumbing and Laurence'll do the carpentry and...
Don't go all quiet on me.
At least tell me you'll think about it.
I don't need to think about it.
(SIGHS)
It's just for a month or so.
I know it'd make her feel a little better.
Will you marry me before you leave?
You don't trust me to come back?
Marry me.
Marry me.
We don't have to tell anybody.
We just do it quickly, just keep it between us.
Why do you want to do it?
Because if we don't, I'm gonna go crazy.
Would a promise not be the same?
If you can promise, you can easily do this.
So this is it.
This is where you live.
(WHISPERING) Yes, and if you make one tiny noise, she'll evict me.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(BELT BUCKLE JANGLING)
- (GRUNTS) - (GASPS)
(PANTING)
(TONY GRUNTING)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
There's no point in worrying now.
Stay with me.
TONY:
You wanna play?
- BOY:
Yeah, sure.
- TONY:
All right, here we go.
One bat coming up, huh?
I'll take that.
All right, you ready?
Hands up.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Boom.
Oh!
Right down the third base line.
MAN:
Is he annoying you?
- Cos he was annoying me.
- No, no, no, no.
I got a brother the exact same age.
- Hey, are you Irish?
- Is it so obvious?
I'm just about to marry an Irish girl, so I guess I notice it more.
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.
Sometimes it seems as though there can't be anybody left at home.
Where's your girl from?
TONY:
Enniscorthy in County Wexford.
MAN:
My wife has family there.
Hey, Eilis.
Come here a sec.
OFFICIAL:
Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.
- MAN:
Good luck.
- TONY:
Thank you.
Come on, come over here.
Come on.
Will we ever tell our children we did this?
Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.
I wonder what they'll think of it.
(♪ ORGAN)
- Nancy.
- You look so glamorous.
I told you so.
I'm so sorry about Rose.
Thank you.
How are you?
No.
I knew, but I wanted to let Nancy tell you herself.
I'm so glad you can come to the wedding.
Can I?
Your mother accepted the invitation on your behalf.
- When is it?
- The 27th of August.
Will you come out with George and me tomorrow night?
Annette wants to see you, too.
Oh, I don't mind.
I'll have to find you a key.
I don't want you getting me out of bed.
We all want to hear what life in New York is like.
I'll try and think of something to say.
I'm booked to go back to New York on the 21st.
Well, you can wait an extra week to see your best friend married.
I can't believe I'm married to someone you'll never know.
But you'd like him.
I know you would.
He's sweet.
And he's funny.
And he's got these wonderful eyes that... (SIGHING)
(SNIFFLES) I wish everything were different.
So, now, Mrs O'Toole from Cush.
Do we really have to do this?
Getting a letter of condolence isn't like getting a birthday present, is it?
What if Mrs O'Toole from Cush writes back to thank you for your thank you?
Then I'll thank her.
And you'd be happy to spend the rest of your life like that?
It's not as if I've anything else to do or anybody else to talk to.
It might as well be Mrs O'Toole from Cush.
What do you want me to say?
(CAR HORN HONKING)
- That'll be Nancy and Annette.
- Off you go.
Enjoy yourself.
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.
It's a great pleasure to meet you.
We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.
There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.
GEORGE:
OK.
Do you have to be with other fellas from the rugby club all the time?
No. (CHUCKLES)
But Nancy told us we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you cos you have too much to say to each other, so we're just looking for company.
Oh, well.
Do you not like the fellas from the rugby club, Eilis?
I don't particularly, George.
When I first went to America,
I missed every single thing about Enniscorthy except one.
We're not all the same.
You all look the same.
It's the blazer and the hair oil.
(LAUGHING)
Nancy.
Where's Annette?
And why has he come?
He's very nice, so don't be too hard on him.
Is this the same Jim Farrell that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?
- What happened to her?
- He broke it off.
He didn't think she was serious about him.
He was very upset for a while, but he's over her now.
Nancy, I'm...
I'm going back.
But you can have a bit of fun while you're here, can't you?
Come on, George.
How's your mother?
She's...
Well, she's sad.
She's got much older very quickly.
It was a terrible thing.
We all went to the funeral Mass,
Mother and Father and myself.
I didn't know that.
My mother played golf with her, you know.
She was very fond of her.
It was...
It was the saddest thing to happen in the town that I can remember.
Thank you.
NANCY:
Come on, you two.
And what about the skyscrapers?
Ah, but that's Manhattan.
I live in Brooklyn and I work in Brooklyn, and if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.
All the skyscrapers are across the river.
NANCY:
You don't make it sound very glamorous.
EILIS:
It's not, really.
Not even, what do you call it, the department store where you work?
Oh, Bartocci's?
Well, it sells lovely things.
But I can't afford many of them and I don't like the work, so...
What would you like to do?
I want to do what Rose did.
I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.
Well, you should call in at Davis's.
They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.
I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.
But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.
I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.
You just want her to stay.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm only thinking of Eilis.
Do you hear that, Eilis?
He's only thinking of you.
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
GEORGE:
That's it, that's it.
Remember, Mrs Grogan didn't notice a thing.
(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
- NANCY:
Good night.
- EILIS:
Good night.
GEORGE:
See you.
(DOOR CLOSES)
How was your evening?
It was very nice, thank you.
Was that Jim Farrell I saw in the car with them?
It was.
His parents are moving, you know.
They're retiring to the country.
He'll be in that big house on his own.
- Is that right?
- Hmm.
He's a catch for someone.
Good night, Mammy.
- Hello, Eilis.
- Hello, Mrs Brennan.
Quite the star.
- Thank goodness you're back.
- What's the matter?
A lad from Davis's came round.
They have a problem in their accounts department.
They need you up there straightaway.
Is that all?
I'll just put the shopping away.
No, no, leave it.
Straightaway, the young fella said.
It doesn't matter what he said, Mother.
I'm not an employee.
I'd be doing them a favour.
Please, let me do the shopping.
MARIA:
The problem is that it's our busy season, so all the mill workers and drivers did overtime last week.
Well, they filled out the overtime slips, but there's been nobody here to work it all out and to add to the wage slips, and some of the men have started to complain, and I can't blame them.
As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.
Well, if you leave me for a couple of hours,
I can work out a system so that whoever comes in after me
- won't have any trouble.
- (SIGHS IN RELIEF)
Hello, Eilis.
Maria has been telling me you've done the most marvellous job here.
Thank you.
We should have known you would, of course.
You're Rose's sister, after all.
I'm told you have a certificate in book-keeping.
Is it American book-keeping?
I got the certificate in America, but the two systems are very similar.
Well, we'll certainly need someone to deal with wages and so on during the busy season.
So I'd like you to continue on a part-time basis.
Let's see how that goes and then we'll speak again.
I'll be going back to the United States soon.
As I say, let's you and I speak again before we make any firm decisions one way or the other.
Yes, Mr Brown.
Of course.
Thank you.
Now, if you go and see Maria, she'll have your money for today.
EILIS:
I'd forgotten.
What?
This.
JIM:
You have beaches in Brooklyn.
Yes, but they're just very crowded.
There'll probably be quite a few walkers along here later.
Yes.
It's still not the same.
I'm sure it's not.
We don't really know anything of the rest of the world.
We must seem very backward to you now.
Of course not.
You seem calm and civilised and charming.
(CHUCKLES)
NANCY:
Come on!
My mother wanted you to know that the golf club is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.
A special trophy for the best score by a lady newcomer at the club.
She was always very nice to the newcomers, my mother says.
I hope you're pleased.
Yes.
Of course.
So every year someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?
Yeah, every year, as long as there's a golf club.
And I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.
Yeah, and my mother would like to meet you too, by the way.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm supposed to arrange a time when you can come around for tea.
Thank you.
I'd like that.
I wish it had been like this before I went.
Before Rose died.
Like what?
There was nothing here for me before and now I have a job and...
NANCY:
Here?
Is that an American trick?
Yes.
It's a good one, isn't it?
It's depressing, though, that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?
I mean, how long have they known about it?
A hundred years, probably.
I don't think they had bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.
We still don't have them now.
Well, come on.
You wanna go see the Dodgers on Saturday?
- Sure.
- OK.
- Will you do something for me?
- What?
If you laugh or you say anything about this to anybody in the family, you don't get to go see the Dodgers on Saturday or any other day of the season.
Also you get a beating.
Maybe it's just better if I don't get involved.
I really need your help, Frankie.
You know you're the best writer and reader in the family?
- Yeah.
- I'm trying to write to Eilis.
And I want it to be...
I don't know.
You've wrote before already about five times.
Yeah, but they're no good, Frankie, and...
She's only written back once.
She's never read my writing before.
I'm worried I'm putting her off me.
Listen, I'm eight years old.
I don't know anything about kissing.
You don't need to know anything about kissing.
You need to know about spelling and...
And...
- Grammar.
- Yeah.
Will you look?
TONY:
Dear Eilis.
I hope that you are doing well in Ireland.
I hope that your mother's feeling less sad.
It will not be long before your friend gets married and you can come home.
This week, it's like the whole world's basements are flooding.
I've fixed three.
I've been working hard.
I've been saving money.
Everybody asks me about you all the time.
FRANKIE:
You missed out an "E," I think.
It's "everybody."
TONY:
Anyway, I think that is all my news.
Mom and Dad and all my brothers, they all say hello.
I think about you most minutes of most days.
Even when I go see the Dodgers,
I do not concentrate on the games.
With love, your Tony.
No hair oil.
And that's not a blazer.
It's a sports jacket.
Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?
- Are you trying to trick me?
- (CHUCKLES)
No.
I knew what you meant when you said we were all the same.
It made me think that my life must seem very easy to you.
I run my father's bar.
I'm going to live in my parents' house.
I know what that must look like from the outside, but...
It doesn't feel like that.
What does it feel like?
And I've never been anywhere.
I've never even been to England but I'd like to see London and Paris and Rome.
New York.
It frightens me, the idea of dying without ever leaving Ireland.
And there are other things too.
I'm so sorry, I wanted to ask you a thousand things and all I've done is talked.
I'm glad.
- Really?
- Yes.
MRS FARRELL:
Will you finish that wretched pipe and sit with us?
I can hear perfectly well from where I am.
We're not here to provide you with entertainment.
MR FARRELL:
Oh, don't you worry.
I found that out many years ago.
(SCOFFS) Just ignore him, Eilis.
(WHISPERS) It's as well Jim takes after me, not him.
Speak up.
Are you looking forward to your move?
We'll miss Enniscorthy, but it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.
Mother's worried about leaving me here on me own.
She thinks I'll destroy the place.
Well, I'm hoping you won't be on your own forever.
I'm sure he won't.
I mean...
God, aren't we blessed with this weather?
It's lovely.
MR FARRELL:
The summers in New York are hot, eh?
They can be, yes.
It can get quite humid sometimes.
EILIS:
Dear Tony.
Thank you for your letters.
I want you to know that... (SIGHS)
I don't know what I want you to know.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
MARY:
I don't want to be sitting right at the back.
We'll make sure you get the best seats in the house.
But it wouldn't feel right sitting up there with Nancy and George.
We'll find the second best seats in the house, then.
Would you like me to run ahead and save you a couple of places, Mrs Lacey?
Would you mind, Jim?
That'd be grand.
- Such a gentleman, isn't he?
- He is.
Came along at just the right time for us.
PRIEST:
I invite you now, Nancy, to declare before God and his Church your consent to become George's wife.
I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.
I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.
PRIEST:
The rings.
Lord, bless these rings.
Grant that those who wear them may always be faithful to each other.
May they do your will and live in peace with you in mutual love.
We ask this through Christ our Lord, amen.
BOTH:
Amen.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Your mother tells me things are working out very well for you in Enniscorthy, Eilis.
It was a lovely service.
And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving out to Glenbrien,
- so Jim'll...
- Yes, I know.
Jim and I promised my mother we'd take her back to the car.
Mmm!
Do you hear that?
"Jim and I. Jim and I."
It won't be long now by the sound of it and your mother will have a wonderful day out.
Will you excuse me?
MAN:
There they are.
- Hello, Mrs Byrne.
How are you?
- Jack.
(♪ JAZZ)
Can we talk?
What about?
The future.
I can't let you just go back to America without saying anything.
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.
So...
I don't want you to go.
I want you to stay here with me.
And I know that means asking you another question but I don't want to bombard you.
So I'll save that one for later.
Thank you.
I'm grateful.
And I'm flattered.
- That's all?
- No.
No, of course not.
I just...
I'd imagined a different life for myself.
I understand.
But your life here could be just as good.
Better even maybe.
(CAR APPROACHING)
Mary.
- I was just coming to fetch you.
- To fetch me?
I haven't worked for Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary.
Please come, Eilis.
She told me not to come back without you.
You know what she's like.
You look after things for five minutes while I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.
There are no customers in there at the moment, so I don't think you can make too much of a mess of things.
So, how have you been getting on?
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.
I heard that you're working over in Davis's, in the accounts department.
That's right.
And there's lots of talk about you and young Jim Farrell.
Oh, well, you know what people are like.
They love to talk.
Yes.
Do you remember Mrs Brady?
She usually comes into the shop on Sunday morning for her rashers.
No?
Well, you have a very busy life now, what with one thing and another.
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece living in Brooklyn.
The world is a small place, isn't it?
She had a letter from her a couple of weeks back.
And what did it say?
Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding at the city hall and her husband bumped into a girl from Enniscorthy who was getting married there.
I'm not sure what you're telling me, Miss Kelly.
He didn't bump into me.
Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.
Although I'm not sure that that's your name any longer, is it?
He couldn't remember.
Something Italian, he thought.
I'd forgotten.
You'd forgotten?
What a thing...
I'd forgotten what this town is like.
What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?
Keep me away from Jim?
Stop me from going back to America?
Perhaps you didn't even know.
My name is Eilis Fiorello.

- OPERATOR:
Putting you through now.
- Thank you.
WOMAN:
How can I help?
Hello.
I'd like to make a reservation for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.
I think people spend even more money after a wedding.
Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.
She was buying firelighters in Broom's.
Firelighters in August.
But she'd seen Mrs Stapleton in there and she hadn't had a chance to go through the whole day in detail with her...
Eilis, what's the matter?
Has something happened with Jim?
(SOBBING) Mammy, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm married.
I got married in Brooklyn before I came home.
And I should have told you.
I should have told you as soon as I got back.
I want to be with him.
I want to be with my husband.
Of course.
Is he nice?
Yes.
He'd have to be nice if you married him.
So you're going back?
Yes.
Tomorrow.
Are you on the early train?
I'm going to bed.
Mammy, it's not even 8:00.
You don't have to.
I'm very tired.
And I'd like to say goodbye now.
And only once.
(SNIFFLES)
Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.
I will.
Good night, Eilis.
(SNIFFLING)
(SIGHS)
So are you away to live in America?
- No.
- Just visiting?
No, I live there already.
Really?
What's it like?
It's a big place.
I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York.
Do you know it?
Yes.
People say that there are so many Irish people there, it's like home.
Is that right?
Yes.
It's just like home.
You're not to eat.
But I might be there years.
No, you can eat when you get there.
Don't eat on the boat.
It'll stop you getting so sick.
Do you promise me?
I promise.
And in a moment I want you to go straight down to your cabin and lock the bathroom door on your side.
When next door starts hammering, you can negotiate.
EILIS:
When you get to immigration, keep your eyes wide open.
Look as if you know where you're going.
You have to think like an American.
You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.
But you will, and it won't kill you.
(SIGHS)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
And one day the sun will come out.
You might not even notice straightaway, it'll be that faint.
And then you'll catch yourself thinking about something or someone who has no connection with the past,
someone who's only yours, and you'll realise... that this is where your life is.
(♪ BE COOL AKA KEEP COOL)
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?
Not if what you're going to say will cause trouble for me in some way or another.
Nine o'clock mass is over, girls.
- Now.
One moment, please.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Brady, what would you like this morning?
Half a dozen rashers, please.
Of course.
Eilis will get that for you now.
-I was next.
- And you still are.
- Yes?
- I need some shoe polish.
Shoe polish?
That's not really a Sunday item now, is it?
These people need things for their dinner or their tea.
Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?
Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.
I'm sorry.
Miss.
Kelly....
I haven't forgotten.
Spit it out, whatever it is.
I'm away to America.
Whose idea was that?
Father Flood in New York arranged it.
Rose used to play golf with him.
He sponsored me.
He found me a job and got me a visa.
Well, we won't be needing you back here.
I could work every Sunday until I go.
No, thank you.
- Your poor sister.
- My sister?
Oh, mothers are always being left behind in this country.
But Rose ...
That's the end for her now, isn't it?
She will be looking after your mother, for the rest of her life.
I wish I had written to Father Flood about you, Rose.
Me?
I have a job.
You had a couple of hours on a Sunday working for Nettles Kelly.
You should not call her that.
I think it's quite a kind name, considering she's actually a terrible old witch.
Well, I don't want to talk about her any more.
Good.
They say it's hotter there in the summer, and colder in the winter.
What in Heaven's name will she do about clothes?
She'll buy them, mother.
She doesn't want to be wasting her money on clothes.
She won't have much choice.
She'll be there for...
- You look beautiful, Nancy.
- Thank you.
You look so beautiful it makes me despair of this place.
Why?
Well, you're the prettiest girl in County Wexford.
You should be able to choose any man you want.
And we're hoping that George Sheridan from the rugby club looks your way.
- Do you think he might?
- Of course he will.
I know you like him, Nancy, but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?
Gary Cooper 美国演员 代表作 《约克军曹》
那些男孩们 打着发油 穿着休闲外套 And those boys with their hair-oil and their blazers...
He has beautiful eyes.
Hmm.
And he's going to come into a beautiful shop in the Market Square.
Why didn't you wear your blue dress?
Are you asking why I didn't make more of an effort?
I suppose because I'm going away.
Come on.
He's looked over here twice already.
He hasn't!
He's walking over here now.
He's not!
我为什么要骗你乔治·谢里丹在干嘛 Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridan's doing?
Would you like to dance?
Is that really everything you own?
Oh, Eilis.
I should have looked after you better.
You've bought most of these clothes in this case.
That's one of the reasons I'm going, because I can't buy my own.
If it was just that, I'd spend every penny I had on you, gladly.
But I can't buy you a future.
I can't buy you the kind of life you need.
I know.
- But you'll come see me there one day?
-Yes.
And you'll look after yourself?
You don't have to worry about me.
And I'll come home to visit, won't I?
Because I couldn't bear it if...
You haven't packed your shoes yet.
They'll take up a bit of room.
There.
I'm sorry.
Off!
Number one.
Bottom bunk.
That's mine.
You're on the top.
This is hell.
Never again.
Never again to America?
The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.
I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.
- Let's go for a smoke.
- I don't.
Suit yourself.
I'll see you later.
Unless I find a nice man in First to smoke with.
It's good to see that not everybody's put off their dinner by the weather forecast.
It's supposed to be a rough one tonight, so none of the other passengers are eating.
A few spoonfuls of soup, maybe, but not the mutton stew.
Please unlock it.
Go away, it is closed.
I'm sorry about the smell, and the bucket.
Don't worry.
The whole boat stinks.
Even First Class.
I've just been thrown out of there, by the way.
The bathroom door was locked all night.
Oh, those bastards.
There.
It won't be very comfortable.
But at least it's ours.
Open the door.
Fuck off!
Do you hear me?
Fuck off!
If you had been nice last night, we would have played fair.
Now you've got no toilet, you bastards.
Go on, you can use it.
I'm gonna get us some water.
That's all you're allowed.
You going to live in America?
You have papers and everything?
Yes.
And a job.
How did you manage to arrange all that?
I didn't.
Someone did it for me.
A priest my sister knows.
And how do you feel about it?
How long do the letters from Ireland take to arrive?
My sister Rose said she'd write straightaway.
They take a long time at first, and then no time at all.
You have family in America?
Friends?
No.
You'll meet people easy enough.
Where are you gonna live?
Brooklyn?
How do you know that?
Lucky guess.
Try to remember that sometimes it's nice to talk to people who don't know your auntie.
That's what it's like?
That's what it's like.
- I've been sick for hours.
-Nice, isn't it?
I am very hungry.
Hmm, that's why you haven't been sick for hours.
We'll eat tomorrow.
Or the day after.
Oh, dear.
We'll have to do something with you.
They'll put you in quarantine or something if you try to enter the country looking like that.
Nothing fancy.
You mustn't look like a tart.
Oh, Well, looking like a tart isn't going to be a problem.
This doesn't look too bad.
My sister gave me that.
穿这个搭一下 Wear it with this... and this.
Open your bags ready for inspection.
Don't look too innocent, though.
I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.
Perhaps some eye-liner.
You step out of the line please.
Thank you.
Next, please.
Thank you.
Passport please.
Stand up straight.
Polish your shoes, and don't cough whatever you do.
Don't be rude, or pushy, and don't look too nervous.
This way!
Think like an American.
You have to know where you're going.
Welcome to the United States, Ma'am.
Through the blue door, please.
Next, please.
Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen.
Amen.
I saw you had a letter today, Diana.
Any news?
Mr. de Valera has had another operation on his eyes, she says.
I don't want news that I can read in a newspaper.
Anyway, we would describe Mr. de Valera as "politics", would we not, Mrs. Kehoe?
And we do not like politics at the dinner table.
We don't.
It's not politics to talk about eye operations.
It is if the eyes belong to a politician.
And I do not like to talk about hospitals very much, either.
Patty, did you have any luck with that cold cream?
I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.
And I showed her the advertisement.
I don't want to have to travel all the way to Manhattan just for a jar of cold cream.
Maybe you could have a look at Bartocci's for me, Eilis?
Yes, Mrs. Kehoe.
Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.
She does not know for sure, Mrs. Kehoe.
She is only saying that Bartocci's is a better store than Webster's to get at Patty.
They are both very good, and you girls are very lucky to be working there.
Eilis, from the look of you, you have greasy skin, is that right?
What do you do about that?
Just...
Well, I wash it, Mrs. Kehoe, with soap.
There is nothing wrong with soap.
Soap was good enough for our Lord.
I expect.
Well, which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?
Does the Bible tell you that?
Our Lord was a man, anyway.
He didn't care about greasy skin.
Ladies.
No more talk about our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.
The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis, won't you, the girls?
巴尔托奇百货
- Hi.
- Good Morning.
Did you go out last night?
- Out.
The opposite of in .
- No.
Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.
"What did you see, Dorothy?"
"I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis.
They filmed it in Ireland."
"Oh, I'm from Ireland".
"I know you are, that's why I thought you might be interested."
Thank you.
Shouldn't be a moment.
Is it still hot out there?
I haven't been outside since this morning but I can tell that it might be.
Very.
It just..
looks it.
It's warm, yes.
Thanks very much.
Remember ...
If people like it here, they will come back.
So you treat every customer as if she's a new friend.
I will try.
It's not a matter of trying.
It's what you have to do.
Do you try to wear panties every day?
No.
I mean, I don't..
I don't try.
I just put them on.
You see what I'm saying?
- Yes.
- Good.
Can I get another sliced toast please?
Slice up some hot dog.
They want them sliced down the middle!
Sorry.
Could I have the bill please?
I hope that when I go through the pearly gates, the first sound I hear is you asking me for the check in that lovely Irish brogue.
Have they told you a date for the nylon sale yet, Eilis?
We've never had a Bartocci's girl living here.
We might get some inside information.
I haven't been told anything.
I'll bet you wouldn't let on if you had.
She's that sort.
More loyal to her bosses than to her friends.
Like a Red spy.
Oh, dear God.
I'll thank you to keep His name out of a conversation about nylons.
He might be everywhere, but he's certainly not in Bartocci's on sale day.
Sorry Mrs. Kehoe.
I was glad to see you finally got some letters from home today, Eilis.
- Did I?
- Em.
I forgot to check.
They'll still be there after dinner.
Oh sorry.
Dear Eilis,
It's hard for me to believe that you're reading this in America.
Thousands of miles across the sea.
The big news here is that since you left,
Mummy has stopped shopping at Nettles Kelly's.
As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh.
And she overcharge for everything.
And she's awful.
I haven't told her to her face.There's no need.
She knows that she overcharges and her bread's not fresh.
We talk about you every evening, of course.
We want to know everything.
I'm sure you're busy, but even if your letters were two hundred pages, they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.
Take care of yourself.
Love.
Is it your time of the month?
So what is it?
Take some time off now.
Go and sit in the staff room.
I'm so sorry, Eilis.
This is all my fault.
I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.
Franco Bartocci says you are doing great here.
Ma Kehoe says you are the nicest lodger she's ever had.
- What?
- Ma Kehoe?
Don't ever call her that to her face.
I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.
I've enrolled you in a night class.
For book-keeping.
The Brooklyn College.
It will be three nights a week.
And I've paid your tuition for the first semester.
- 为什么 - 干嘛问为什么
- Why?
- "Why?"
Not "Thank you"?
Sorry, thank you.
But why?
I was amazed that someone as clever as you couldn't find proper work at home.
I've been here too long.
I forget what it's like in Ireland.
So when your sister wrote to me about you
I said that the Church would try to help.
Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.
I wish that I could stop feeling that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.
All I can say is that it will pass.
Homesickness is like most sicknesses.
It will make you feel wretched, and then it will move on to somebody else.
Now, Taylor versus Standard Gas Co is one of the most important corporate cases decided in the Supreme Court in the last twenty years.
This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock doctrine, so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.
In public utility integration proceedings alone literally thousands of investors may be affected by its application.
Did you understand any of that?
I mean, a single word?
He's not even reading from a book.
He just knows all this.
Well, Let's hope the next hour is easier.
One of the things that ruins Christmas in America is the turkey.
It all tastes of sawdust.
So that's one cheese sandwich for Miss McAdam, and extra turkey for everyone else.
Ladies, please.
Eilis, Father Flood told me about your Christmas plans.
Oh, you're not serving lunch to the old fellas who've nowhere to go, are you?
He asks us every year.
We always say no.
Ellis, you're a saint.
They smell awful.
Sheila knows how they smell because that's where she goes husband-hunting.
It's a marvelous thing you're doing, Eilis.
A Christian thing.
I wish there were more like you.
You can come.
How many are we expecting?
There were a hundred last year.
There may be more this.
- They all Irish?
- All Irish.
Why don't they go home?
If there's nothing there for a clever young girl such as yourself, there's gonna be even less for men like these.
Some of them have been here fifty years, they have lost touch with everyone.
Happy Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.
These are the men who built ... the tunnels, the bridges, the highways.
God alone knows what they live on now.
I don't want to interrupt the proceedings, but I'm sure you'd all like to show your appreciation to all the ladies here for their hard day's work.
And by way of a thank you, we have a great singer in the room with us today.
Frankie.
Would you like to come into the front room for a glass of something?
You've earned it.
- You survived!
- Oh it wasn't so bad.
- Happy Christmas!
- Cheers.
Now Miss McAdam is leaving us.
She is going to live with her sister in Manhattan.
She has the best room in the house.
The basement.
And it has its own entrance.
Now, I can only let a certain kind of girl stay there.
Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.
Although I will admit that God did give Miss McAdam an advantage, when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.
No no, you're a pretty girl Eilis.
But you're sensible.
So, you're having the room and that's that.
Would the other girls not mind?
Oh, I expect so.
What don't they mind?
Girls, you'll take Dolores to dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?
There's a dance?
At the parish hall.
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.
Umm, Patty and I aren't going this week.
We're going to see a movie instead.
Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.
I would, very much.
There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.
Yes, surprising, isn't it?
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Of course, you'd be welcome to join us, Dolores.
So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.
So you both miraculously found boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?
Well, I hope you have more luck with these than you did with the last few.
- Will you be going, Eilis?
- Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
Well, you can take Dolores, then.
Of course.
God, there's nobody here.
How are we supposed to get a fella if there's nobody here?
I expect most people will come after nine.
People?
Or fellas?
Some of the people will be fellas.
I'd love to meet a fella.
They came!
The liars!
What a pair of bitches.
That's what the old woman called them.
She said they were all bitches, apart from you.
Well hello.
Hello.
It's good to see you.
I can see why.
Come with us.
There.
That's better.
Now you don't look like you came in from milking the cows.
Is that what I looked like?
Just a bit.
Nice clean cows.
1, 2, 3 ...
Not bad.
Maybe we could have a dance later?
- Sorry?
- A dance later.
Oh sure.
Would you like to dance?
Are you here with that guy?
The one who was teaching you to dance?
No.
So would you dance with me?
I'm not sure he taught me anything.
Doesn't matter.
The secret is to look as though you know what you're doing.
Ah.
I wish someone had told me that years ago.
Come on.
- Where do you live?
- Clinton Street.
Yeah?
That's on my way home.
Can I walk you?
I'm going to say yes, and then I'm going to tell you why.
So I don't get the wrong idea?
I suppose so.
Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?
You don't know her?
I do.
She lives in my boarding house, and she's awful.
If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.
You'd be rescuing me.
I get it.
- I'm not Irish.
- You don't sound Irish.
I need to make this clear.
No part of me is Irish.
I don't have Irish parents or grandparents or anything.
I'm an Italian.
Well, my my parents are, anyway.
So what were you doing at an Irish dance?
Don't the Italians have dances?
Yeah.
And I wouldn't want to take you to one.
They behave like Italians all night.
What does that mean?
- Oh, you know.
- No.
- Hands.
- Too many of them?
Oh,my.
I guess it could seem that way, if it was a girl.
Listen
I want everything out in the open.
I came to the Irish dance because I really like Irish girls.
And I was the only one who would dance with you?
Oh, no, it wasn't...
Oh, so you danced with loads of others?
This is me.
Can I take you next week?
Maybe get something to eat first?
That'd be nice.
Good night.
There you go.
So...
What do you do when you're not working?
Well.
There's school.
Just, you know...
Brooklyn College.
I'm studying book-keeping.
You want to be a book-keeper?
Well, I want to be an accountant one day.
But, yes, book-keeping first.
Wow.
Is that difficult?
I'm talking too much.
Tell me about plumbing.
- You know enough about plumbing already.
- I don't know anything.
You know that taps drip and toilets get blocked and that's all you need to know.
I don't know anything about book-keeping.
Well.There's a lot to it.
There's all the maths, of course, but that's not so complicated.
The double entry system, that takes a while to get used to.
And we study company law, too, and that terrifies me.
So we had to read about an insurance company that went bankrupt in the 1930s, and all the the legal issues that went along with that...
She plays golf, and she's really good at it.
And if she'd been at the dance last Saturday,then...
I don't think you'd have looked at me twice, because Rose is beautiful.
I'm worried you haven't eaten anything.
Too busy talking.
What is the matter with you girls now?
Nothing is matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.
Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?
Eilis' young man?
We didn't know.
She won't say anything about it.
And why should she, to you awful gossip-mongers?
Anyway, I met him on Saturday night ... when he called for Eilis, and he is a gentleman.
Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs Kehoe?
We know he's quite nice-looking.
I didn't like his shoes much.
What on earth is wrong with the shoes?
They were a funny color.
I'll tell you this much:
I am going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness.
I see now that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin.
A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man, and the noise she makes is a lot worse.
Now, enough.
Yeah.
Think about it.
You can...
Yeah,yeah.
All I want to do is travel home with you.
No food, no drink, no nothing.
I know you got to study and get some sleep.
I'll take you to your house and say goodnight.
Otherwise, it's too long to wait.
I want to ask you something.
And you're gonna say, "oh, it's too soon."
"I don't really know him well enough, we've only been out a couple times."
Oh, it's nothing so bad.
It is just something that most guys...
Please just ask.
You're beginning to terrify me.
Oh.
Sure.
Will you come for dinner and meet my family sometime?
That's it?
I'd love to.
You like italian food?
Don't know.
I've never eaten it.
It is the best food in the world.
Well, why would not I like it?
You're in a good mood, huh?
Yes, why?
It's just...
I like how you're being, I don't know the word.
When you go along with everything.
Amenable?
Yeah.
Amenable.
OK, so while you're being amenable..
Can we go see a movie this week when you're not in night classes?
I'll sign up for two movies.
- Really?
- Yes.
Even if the first date is a disaster,
I'll give it another chance.
It certainly feels like it, but this is my first year, so I don't know how to judge.
Well congratulations.
You survived your first New York winter.
Ah, it wasn't so bad.
Really?
It's colder in Ireland?
Oh no, it's colder here.
Over here, that's how we judge the winter.
On how cold it is.
But you have heating.
Heating everywhere.
You're only cold outside.
I guess that's true.
- Thank you for your help.
- Have a good day.
Eilis!
You're like a different person!
How did you do it?
Maybe I can pass some advice on to the next poor girl who feels that way.
I met somebody.
An Italian fella.
Oh no.
I'm not passing that on.
I'd rather have them homesick than heartbroken.
Does he talk about baseball all the time?
Or his mother?
No.
Then keep him.
There isn't another Italian man like him in New York.
Hold it.
Now remember You're getting off easy, because we haven't got sauce.
Yeah.
You have to remember that the sauce flies everywhere, so take it slowly.
I'm gonna say "Splash" anytime I see problems.
- Good idea.
- Can I start now?
- Yeah!
- Go!
SPLASH!
You just splashed his mother, and his father, and the walls...
Let's go again.
Dear Rose, I suppose the most important news is that I have a boyfriend
He isn't as important as Bartocci's ... and my evening classes, I know that.
But I wanted to tell you everything that is going on.
Please don't mention it to Mummy though.
You know what's she like.
He's decent and kind, and he has a job, and he works hard.
We go to the cinema on Wednesdays and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.
I think of you and mother every single day.
But Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here.
I didn't have before I met him.
My body was here, but my life was back in Ireland with you.
Now it's halfway across the sea.
So that's something, isn't it?
对了 我得提醒你小心弗兰基 Oh and I'd better warned you about Frankie.
He's the little one.
Yeah.
He's eight going on eighteen.
He's nice and he's smart, but he's been talking and he's talking about all the things he's gonna to say to you.
- What sorts of things?
- We don't know.
Could be anything.
I mean, I swear I tried to pay him money to go out and play ball with his friends.
And my dad, he threatened him, but I think he's looking forward to causing trouble so much so he'll happily take a beating.
This is us here.
Ready?
Hey, how did you learn to eat spaghetti like that?
I've been taking lessons.
Lessons?
Like, in a class?
You can do that?
Maybe I could teach you.
No, no.
Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me... cooked me some spaghetti and made me try and eat it without making a mess.
So, what do you eat in Ireland?
Just Irish stew?
Not just.
We...
So first of all I should say that we don't like Irish people.
Hey, hey ...
- Frankie!
- What?
We don't!
That is a well known fact!
Why Frankie?
Because a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up and he had to get stitches.
And because all the cops round here are Irish, nobody did anything about it.
There are probably two sides to it.
I might have said something I shouldn't, you know, I can't remember now.
No, because they beat you up.
Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.
No.
They just had red hair and big legs.
Raise up!
Excuse us.
All I can say in his defence is that he's the only one of us who'll get a college education.
If he can keep his mouth shut.
So, Tony tells me go to college.
Oh, just night classes.
I want to be a book-keeper.
I like working in the shop well enough, but I don't want to be there forever.
Good.
I'm sorry, Eilis.
I'm an idiot.I'm a rude idiot.
So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbett's Field when the season starts?
You like baseball?
He never mentioned the Dodgers?
Not even once?
Tony, what is the matter with you?
You know why?
Too much of this.
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbett's Field if you want to see him in the summer.
They're that important to you?
Put it this way.
If our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants, it would break my heart.
Mine too.
She's not laughing, Tony.
I think it's too late.
She's a Yanks fan.
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?
He's a Yanks fan.
I love you.
I..
Thank you for the evening.
It was lovely.
Sorry!
I'd finished.
Sheila can I ask you something?
Why are not you married?
Because my husband met somebody else and left me.
Oh I'm sorry.
And ...
Well, would you get married again?
- Has somebody asked you?
- No, not really.
I won't ask what that means.
Sheila?
Would I get married again?
No.
I want to be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding-house, forever.
Of course, I do.
That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.
I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom.
While some bad-tempered fella, with hair growing out of his ears reads the newspaper on the toilet.
And then I'll wish I was back here, talking to you.
I'll catch you tomorrow right?
Eilis!
I'm sorry!
I did not think you were coming.
I know.
I thought you were gonna think that.
That's why I wanted to be here.
No matter what.
I need to say something...
Can you...
Can we talk about something else ... until we get to Ms. Kehoe?
- It's Not ...
- Please?
So.
Ten minutes before I'm supposed meet you ... and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.
Yes.
Even if you were thinking of inviting me in for a coffee.
I would have to say no, for your sake.
So how did you fix it in ten minutes?
I didn't.
I spent the whole ten minutes explaining to the old lady that I had to be somewhere and I'd be back.
She didn't want to let me go.
So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?
Oh, what's the difference between six inches of sewage and a foot?
Let me say what I want to say.
I don't think you'll mind.
Okay.
You remember that after I had dinner at your house, you told me you loved me.
Well, I didn't really know what to say.
But I know what to say now.
I have thought about you.
And I like you, and I like being with you and ...
Maybe, I feel the same way.
So the next time you tell me you love me, if there is a next time ...
I'll say I love you too.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Holy shit!
Excuse my language, but...
I thought we were having a different kind of talk.
Can I go home now?
- You love Me?
- Yes.
But don't ask me anything else, and don't talk about our kids being Dodgers fans.
Oh what?
You want kids who like the Yankees?
Tony, please don't push me.
All right.
I'm sorry.
Dear Eilis,
Thank you so much for the nylons.
The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.
It seems everything is so exciting and new compared to here.
I can't wait for you to show it all to me one day.
Oh Eilis, you know I'm by your side, even when I'm not.
Well.
You're marvelous, that's all I have to say.
And it looks to me as if you didn't just pass those exams.
You, you flew through them.
I can't remember the last time anyone came here with good news.
I've saved some money.
I'll be able to pay for next year's tuition and pay you back for last year.
One of my parishioners paid.
He needed to do something for mankind, and I won't tell you why.
He is not out of the woods yet, either.
so he can cough up for next year, too.
I'd love to know what sort of woods he's in.
Yes, I'm sure you would, but you won't hear it from me.
Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.
You're not the miserable young girl who wanted to go home last winter.
Seems like years ago.
Now, I think this is the first time ... any girl of mine has ever passed an exam, while living here.
Have you told Tony yet, Eilis?
Of course.
And is he taking you out to celebrate?
We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.
- Oh, boy!
- What does that mean?
Do you have a bathing costume?
- No, I was going to get one...
- Do you have sunglasses?
- No.
- You need sunglasses.
I read that if you don't have them on the beach this year people will talk about you.
And what exactly will they say, Sheila?
That's the thing, Mrs. Kehoe.
You'd never know, because they'd never say it to your face.
Oh, dear God!
Diana's right, though, Eilis.
You need to think carefully about your costume.
It's the most Tony will ever have seen of you.
You don't want to put him off.
You'll have to shave down there.
I'll give you a razor that will do the trick.
You're all right there for the moment.
And most Italian men appreciate the fuller figure.
But watch yourself, over the summer.
The black's too dark for your pale skin.
Let's see you in the green.
Look at that thing.
Why didn't you tell me to put my costume on underneath my clothes?
I thought you'd know.
Right, I'm ready.
- Tony!
- What?
Come on.
Dear Rose, Thanks for your letter.
I was happy to hear about your golf tournament.
You must have been really pleased.
I still miss you and mother, and I think about you every day.
But I think I can say that for the first time since I've been in America,
I'm really happy.
This is a lot to do with Tony.
At the weekend he took me to see the Brooklyn Dodgers, the baseball team he loves.
They lost, so he was annoyed.
But I've also started to look for office work, too.
I had an interview this week ... at a textile firm here in Brooklyn.
Rose?
Who'd have thought that there would be two book-keepers in the family?
Rose?
I'll soon be able to afford to come home and see you and mummy.
Rose!
Rose?
Oh my God!
Oh God!
Rose?
Oh no!
A moment.
It was sudden.
I think perhaps she was ill, and she knew she was ill, and she didn't tell anybody.
What will happen?
What can happen?
- When will they bury her?
- Tomorrow.
- Without me.
- Without you.
You're too far away, Eilis.
Why did I ever come here?
Rose wanted a better life for you.
She loved how well you were doing.
But I will never see her again.
That's right, isn't it, Father?
I will never see her again.
You know that I think you will.
And she will be watching over you, every day, for the rest of your life.
Hello?
Mommy?
Can you hear me now?
Hello?
I can't really hear you.
Well, the rain held off, anyway.
And the whole of her golf club came.
Every single one of them.
We had a real houseful afterwards.
Are you still there?
Yes.
People really loved her, Eilis.
Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.
Nobody knew what to say to me.
When your daddy died, I said to myself that I shouldn't grieve too much because I had the two of you.
Then when you went to America, I told myself the same thing because she was here with me.
But everyone's gone, Eilis.
I have nobody.
I can't bear it, Tony.
You wanna go home, I guess.
And how would it be for you, if I did go home?
I'll be afraid, every single day.
- Afraid that I wouldn't come back?
- Yes.
Home is home.
I'm not sure if I have a home anymore.
You are not going to work tomorrow, are you?
After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?
This is it.
We're gonna build five houses here, if we can.
And mom and dad, they are gonna have one,
Cos ma always wanted a house with a backyard.
We'll sell three.
And the other one...
My brothers they asked me if I wanted it and I said that I did.
So, I guess what I'm saying is if you want to live out here on Long Island?
I mean I know it doesn't look like much right now, but all the land around here has been sold, so we wouldn't be on our own.
And there would be telephone cables, electricity and everything.
We're gonna set up a company, a building company, the three of us.
And I'm gonna do the plumbing and Lawrence is gonna do the carpentry.
Don't go all quiet on me.
At least tell me you'll think about it.
I don't need to think about it.
It's just for a month or so.
I know it would make her feel a little better.
Will you marry me before you leave?
You don't trust me to come back?
Marry me!
Marry me!
We don't have to tell anyone.
We just do it quickly, just keep it between us.
Why do you want to do it?
Because if we don't, I am gonna go crazy.
Would a promise not be the same?
If you can promise, you can easily do this.
So this is it?
This is where you live?
Yes, and if you make one tiny noise she'll evict me.
Oh, man!
Oh, man!
Oh, there's no point in worrying now.
Stay with me.
- Do you want to play?
- Yes, sure.
Alright.
Here we go, one bat coming up.
I'll take that, alright.
You ready?
Hands up.
Oh, right down to the third-base line.
Is he annoying you?
Because he is annoying me.
No no no.
I got a brother the exact same age?
Hey, are you Irish?
Is it so obvious?
I'm just about to marry an Irish girl, so I guess I notice it more.
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.
Sometimes it seems as though there can't be anybody left at home.
Where is your girl from?
Enniscorthy, in County Wexford.
I think my wife has family there.
Hey, Eilis!
Come here for a second.
Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.
Will we ever tell our children we did this?
Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.
I wonder what they'll think of it.
Nancy!
You look so glamorous!
I told you so.
- I'm so sorry about Rose.
- Thank you.
How are you?
No!
I knew.
But I wanted to let Nancy tell you herself.
- I am so glad you can come to the wedding.
- Can I?
Your mother accepted the invitation on your behalf.
- When is it?
- The 27th of August.
Will you come out with George and me tomorrow night?
Annette wants to see you, too.
Oh, I don't mind.
I'll have to find you a key.
I don't want you getting me out of bed.
We all want to hear what life in New York is like.
I'll try and think of something to say.
I'm booked to go back to New York on twenty-first.
Oh, you can wait an extra week to see your best friend married.
I can't believe I'm married to someone you'll never know.
But you'd like him.
I know you would.
He's sweet.
He's funny.
而且他的眼睛非常美 And he has got these wonderful eyes that...
我好希望事情不是现在这样 I wish everything were different...
So, now.
Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.
Do we really have to do this?
Getting a letter of condolence isn't like getting a birthday present, is it?
What if Mrs. O'Toole from Cush writes back
To thank you for your thank you?
Then I'll thank her.
And you'll be happy to spend the rest of your life like that?
It's not as if I have anything else to do.
Nor anybody else to talk to.
It might as well be Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.
What do you want me to say?
That would be Nancy and Annette.
Off you go.
Enjoy yourself.
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.
It's a great pleasure to meet you.
We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.
There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.
Okay.
Do you have to be with other fellas from the rugby club all the time?
No.
But Nancy told us that we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you.
Because you have too much to say to each other.
So we're just looking for company.
Oh, well.
Do you not like the fellas from the rugby club, Eilis?
I don't particularly, George.
When I first went to America,
I missed everything about Enniscorthy, except one.
We are not all the same.
You all look the same.
It's the blazer and the hair-oil.
Nancy, where is Annette?
And why has he come?
He's very nice, so don't be too hard on him.
Is this the same Jim Farrell that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?
What happened to her?
是他提了分手 吉姆觉得她并不是真正爱他 He broke it off.
He didn't think she was serious about him.
He was very upset for a while, but he's over her now.
Nancy, I'm going back.
But you can have a bit of fun while you're here, can't you?
Come on George.
How is your mother?
Well, she's sad.
And she's got much older very quickly.
It was a terrible thing.
We all went to the funeral mass.
My mother and my father and myself.
I did not know that.
My mother played golf with her, you know. she is very fond of her.
It was the saddest thing that happened in the town that I can remember.
- Thank you.
- Come on you two.
- What about the skyscrapers?
- But that is Manhattan.
I live in Brooklyn and I work in Brooklyn.
And if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.
All the skyscrapers are across the river.
- You don't make it sound very glamorous.
- It's not, really.
连那个 唉你叫它什么来着 Not even...
What do you call it?
The department store where you work?
Oh, Bartocci's?
Well, it sells lovely things, but I can't afford many of them ... and I don't like the works.
What would you like to do?
I want to do what Rose did.
I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.
You should call in at Davis's.
They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.
I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.
But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.
I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.
Oh, you just want her to stay.
I am only thinking of Eilis.
Did you hear that Eilis?
He's only thinking of you.
That's it, that's it...
- Good night.
- Good night.
- See you.
- See you.
Bye.
- How's your evening?
- It's very nice, thank you.
Was that Jim Farrell I saw on the car with them?
It was.
His parents are moving, you know.
They're retiring to the country.
He'll be in that big house on his own.
Is that right?
It's a catch for "someone".
Goodnight Mommy.
- Hello Eilis.
- Hello Ms. Brennan..
I like her style.
- Thank Goodness you're back!
- What's the matter?
A lad from Davis's came round.
They have a problem in their accounts department
- And they need you up there straight away.
- Is that all?
- I'll just put the shopping away.
- No, no, leave it.
那小伙子说的是 马上 "Straight away", the young fella said.
It doesn't matter what he said, Mother.
I'm not an employee.
I'd be doing them a favour.
Please let me do the shopping.
The problem is that it's our busy season, so all the middle workers and drivers did overtime last week.
Well, they filled out the overtime slips but there's been nobody to work it all out, to add to the wage slips.
And some of the men have started to complain.
And I can't blame them.
As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.
Well.
If you leave me for a couple of hours, I can work out a system so that whoever comes in after me won't have any trouble.
Hello, Eilis.
Maria has been telling me you have done the most marvellous job here.
Thank you.
We should have known you would, of course.
You're Rose's sister, after all.
I'm told you have a certificate in book-keeping?
Is it in American book-keeping?
I got the certificate in America, but the two systems are very similar.
Well, we'll certainly need someone to deal with wages and so on during the busy season.
so I'd like you to continue on a part-time basis.
Let's see how that goes and then we'll speak again.
I'll be going back to the United States soon.
As I said.
Lets you and I speak again before we make any firm decisions one way or the other.
Yes, Mr. Brown.
Of course.
Thank you.
Now, if you go and see Maria, she'll have your money for today.
- I'd forgotten.
- What?
眼前的景色 This...
You have beaches in Brooklyn?
Yes, but they are just very crowded.
There will probably be quite a few walkers along here later.
Yes.
It's still not the same.
I'm sure it's not.
We don't really know anything of the rest of the world.
We must seem very backward to you now.
Of course not.
You seem calm, and civilised.
And charming.
Come on!
我母亲想让你知道 她们的高尔夫俱乐部 My mother wanted you to know that the golf club... is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.
A special trophy for the best score by a lady newcomer at the Club.
She was always very nice to the newcomers, my mother says.
I hope you're pleased.
Yes, of course.
So, every year, someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?
Every year.
As long as there's a golf club.
And I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.
Yeah and my mother would like to meet you too, by the way.
I'm supposed to arrange a time when you can come around for tea.
Thank you, I'd like that.
I wish it had been like this before I went.
- Before Rose died.
- Like what?
之前我什么都没有 而现在 我有了一份工作 还...
There was nothing here for me here before.
And now I have a job, and...
Here?
-这是美国人的方法吗 -是的 不错呢 是吧
- Is that an American trick?
- Yes.
It's a good one, isn't it?
It's depressing, though, that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?
I mean how long have they known about it?
A hundred years, probably.
I don't think they had bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.
And we still don't have them now.
Well, come on.
You want to go see the Dodgers on Saturday?
Sure.
Okay, will you do something for me?
What?
If you laugh, or you say anything about this to anybody in the family, you don't get to see the Dodgers on Saturday.
Or any other day of the season.
Also, you get a beating.
Maybe it's just better if I don't get involved.
I really need your help Frankie.
You know you're the best writer and reader in the family?
I'm trying to write to Eilis, and I want it to be, I don't know ...
You wrote before already.
About five times.
Yeah, but they are no good Frankie and ...
And she's only written back once.
She's never read my writing before.
I'm worried I'm putting her off me.
Listen, I'm eight years old, I don't know anything about kissing.
You don't need to know anything about kissing.
You need to know about spelling and...and...
- Grammar?
- Yeah, Will you look?
Dear Eilis, I hope that you're doing well in Ireland.
I hope that your mother is feeling less sad.
It will not be long before your friend gets married and you can come home.
This week it is like the whole world's basements are flooding.
I fixed three.
I've been working hard.
I've been saving money.
Everybody asks me about you all the time.
You missed out the "e" I think.
It is "everybody."
Anyway, I think that is all my news.
Mom and dad and all my brothers they all say hello.
I think about you most minutes of most days.
Even when I go see the Dodgers.
I do not concentrate on the game.
With love, your Tony.
No hair oil.
And that's not a blazer, it's a sports jacket.
Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?
Are you trying to trick me?
I knew what you meant, when you said we're all the same.
It made me think that my life must seem very east to you.
I run my father's bar, going to live in my parents' house.
I know what that must look like from the outside
But it doesn't feel like that.
What does it feel like?
I've never been anywhere.
I have never even been to England.
But I'd like to see London, and Paris and Rome.
New York.
It frightens me, the idea of dying without ever leaving Ireland.
And there are other things too ...
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to ask you a thousand things and all I've done is talked.
I am glad.
- Really?
- Yes.
Will you finsh that wretched pipe and sit with us?
I can hear perfectly well from where I am.
We are not here to provide you with entertainment.
Oh, don't you worry.
I found that out many years ago.
Just ignore him, Eilis.
It's as well Jim takes after me, but him.
Speak up!
Are you looking forward to your move?
Ah, I will miss Enniscorthy.
But it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.
My mother's worried about leaving me here on me own.
She thinks I'll destroy the place.
I'm hoping you won't be on your own forever.
I'm sure he won't.
I mean...
- God, aren't we blessed with this weather.
- It's lovely.
Dear Tony, thank you for your letters.
I want you to know that...
I don't know what I want you to know.
I don't want to be sitting right at the back.
I'll make sure you get the best seats in the house.
Oh, it wouldn't feel right sitting up there with Nancy and George.
We'll find the second best seats in the house then.
Would you like me to run ahead and save you a couple of places, Mrs. Lacey?
Would you mind Jim?
That would be grand.
- Such a gentleman, isn't he?
- He is.
He came along at just the right time for us.
I invite you now Nancy, to declare before God and his church ... your consent to become George's wife.
I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.
I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.
The rings.
Lord, bless these rings, grant that those who wear them may always be faithful to each other.
May they do your will and live in peace with you, and mutual love.
We ask this through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Amen.
Your mother tells me things are working out for you very well in Enniscorthy, Eilis.
It was a lovely service.
And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving out to Glenbrien, so Jim will...
Yes, I know.
Jim and I promised my mother we'd take her back to the car.
哦 听到了吗 吉姆和我 吉姆和我 Oh, do you hear that? "Jim and I!
Jim and I!".
It won't be long now, by the sound of it, and your mother will have a wonderful day out.
Will you excuse me?
Can we talk?
- What about?
- The future.
I can't let you just go back to America without saying anything.
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.
So, I don't want you to go.
I want you to stay here, with me.
And I know that means asking you another question,
But I don't want to bombard you.
So I'll save that one for later.
Thank you.
I'm grateful.
And I'm flattered.
- That's all?
- No.
No, of course not.
It is just...
I'd imagined a different life for myself.
I understand.
But your life here could be just as good.
Better,even, maybe.
Mary!
I was just coming to fetch you.
To fetch me?
I haven't worked for Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary.
Oh, Please come Eilis.
She told me not to come back without you.
You know what she's like.
You look after things for five minutes while I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.
There are no customers in there at the moment, so I don't think you can make too much of a mess of things.
So.
How have you been getting on?
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.
I heard that you're working over at Davis's?
In the accounts department?
That's right.
And there's lots of talk about you and young Jim Farrell.
Ah, well.
You know what people are like.
They love to talk.
Yes.
Do you remember Mrs. Brady?
She usually comes into the shop on Sunday morning for her rashers.
No?
Well, you have a very busy life now.
What with one thing and another.
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece living in Brooklyn.
The world is a small place, isn't it?
She had a letter from her a couple of weeks back.
And what did it say?
Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding at the city hall, and her husband bumped into a girl from Enniscorthy who was getting married there.
I'm not sure what you're telling me, Miss Kelly.
He didn't bump into me.
Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.
Although I'm not sure that that's your name any longer, is it?
He couldn't remember.
Something Italian, he thought.
I'd forgotten.
You'd forgotten!
What a thing for...
I'd forgotten what this town is like.
What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?
Keep me away from Jim?
Stop me from going back to America?
Perhaps you didn't even know.
My name is Eilis Fiorello.
- Thank you.
- How I can help you?
Hello, I'd like to make a reservation for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.
I think people spend even more money after a wedding.
Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.
She was buying firelighters in Broom's.
Firelighters!
In August!
But she'd seen Mrs. Stapleton in there, and she hadn't had a chance to go through the whole day in detail with her, so...
Eilis, what's the matter?
Has something happened with Jim?
Mommy, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm married.
I got married in Brooklyn before I came home.
I should have told you.
I should have told you as soon as I got back.
I want to be with him.
I want to be with my husband.
Of course.
Is he nice?
Yes.
He'd have to be nice, if you married him.
So you are going back?
Yes.
Tomorrow.
Are you on the early train?
I'm going to bed.
Mummy...
It's not even eight o'clock.
You don't have to..
I'm very tired.
And I'd like to say goodbye now, and only once.
Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.
I will.
Goodnight Eilis.
So are you away to live in America?
- No.
- Just visiting?
No.
I live there already.
Really?
What's it like?
It's a big place.
I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York.
Do you know it?
Yes.
People say that there's so many Irish people there.
It's like home.
Is that right?
Yes, it's just like home.
You're not to eat.
But I might be there years.
No, you can eat when you get there.
Don't eat on the boat.
It'll stop you getting so sick.
Do you promise me?
I promise.
And in a moment, I want you to go straight down to your cabin and lock the bathroom door on your side.
When next door starts hammering, you can negotiate.
When you get to Immigration, keep your eyes wide open,
Look as if you know where you're going.
You have to think like an American.
Could you please step forward?
You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die, and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.
But you will, and it won't kill you.
And one day the sun will come out and you might not even note it straight away, it would be that faint.
And then you will catch yourself thinking about something or or someone who has no connection with the past,
Someone who's only yours.
And you'll realise that this is where your life is.
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?
Not if what you're going to say will cause trouble for me in some way or another.
Nine o'clock mass is over, girls.
- Now.
One moment, please.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Brady, what would you like this morning?
Half a dozen rashers, please.
Of course.
Eilis will get that for you now.
- I was next.
- And you still are.
- Yes?
- I need some shoe polish.
Shoe polish?
That's not really a Sunday item now, is it?
These people need things for their dinner or their tea.
Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?
Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.
I'm sorry.
Miss.
Kelly...
I haven't forgotten.
Spit it out, whatever it is.
I'm away to America.
Whose idea was that?
Father Flood in New York arranged it.
Rose used to play golf with him.
He sponsored me.
He found me a job and got me a visa.
Well, we won't be needing you back here.
I could work every Sunday until I go.
No, thank you.
- Your poor sister.
- My sister?
Oh, mothers are always being left behind in this country.
But Rose...
That's the end for her now, isn't it?
She will be looking after your mother, for the rest of her life.
I wish I had written to Father Flood about you, Rose.
Me?
I have a job.
You had a couple of hours on a Sunday working for Nettles Kelly.
You should not call her that.
I think it's quite a kind name, considering she's actually a terrible old witch.
Well, I don't want to talk about her any more.
Good.
They say it's hotter there in the summer, and colder in the winter.
What in Heaven's name will she do about clothes?
She'll buy them, mother.
She doesn't want to be wasting her money on clothes.
She won't have much choice.
She'll be there for...
- You look beautiful, Nancy.
- Thank you.
You look so beautiful it makes me despair of this place.
Why?
Well, you're the prettiest girl in County Wexford.
You should be able to choose any man you want.
And we're hoping that George Sheridan from the rugby club looks your way.
- Do you think he might?
- Of course he will.
I know you like him, Nancy,
Gary Cooper but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?
And those boys with their hair-oil and their blazers...
He has beautiful eyes.
Hmm.
And he's going to come into a beautiful shop in the Market Square.
Why didn't you wear your blue dress?
Are you asking why I didn't make more of an effort?
I suppose because I'm going away.
Come on.
He's looked over here twice already.
He hasn't!
He's walking over here now.
He's not!
Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridan's doing?
Would you like to dance?
Is that really everything you own?
Oh, Eilis.
I should have looked after you better.
You've bought most of these clothes in this case.
That's one of the reasons I'm going, because I can't buy my own.
If it was just that,
I'd spend every penny I had on you, gladly.
But I can't buy you a future.
I can't buy you the kind of life you need.
I know.
- But you'll come see me there one day?
- Yes.
And you'll look after yourself?
You don't have to worry about me.
And I'll come home to visit, won't I?
Because I couldn't bear it if...
You haven't packed your shoes yet.
They'll take up a bit of room.
There.
I'm sorry.
Off!
Number one.
Bottom bunk.
That's mine.
You're on the top.
This is hell.
Never again.
Never again to America?
The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.
I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.
- Let's go for a smoke.
- I don't.
Suit yourself.
I'll see you later.
Unless I find a nice man in First to smoke with.
It's good to see that not everybody's put off their dinner by the weather forecast.
It's supposed to be a rough one tonight, so none of the other passengers are eating.
A few spoonfuls of soup, maybe, but not the mutton stew.
Please unlock it.
Go away, it is closed.
I'm sorry about the smell, and the bucket.
Don't worry.
The whole boat stinks.
Even First Class.
I've just been thrown out of there, by the way.
The bathroom door was locked all night.
Oh, those bastards.
There.
It won't be very comfortable.
But at least it's ours.
Open the door.
Fuck off!
Do you hear me?
Fuck off!
If you had been nice last night, we would have played fair.
Now you've got no toilet, you bastards.
Go on, you can use it.
I'm gonna get us some water.
That's all you're allowed.
You going to live in America?
Yes.
You have papers and everything?
Yes.
And a job.
How did you manage to arrange all that?
I didn't.
Someone did it for me.
A priest my sister knows.
And how do you feel about it?
How long do the letters from Ireland take to arrive?
My sister Rose said she'd write straightaway.
They take a long time at first, and then no time at all.
You have family in America?
Friends?
No.
You'll meet people easy enough.
Where are you gonna live?
Brooklyn?
How do you know that?
Lucky guess.
Try to remember that sometimes it's nice to talk to people who don't know your auntie.
That's what it's like?
That's what it's like.
- I've been sick for hours.
- Nice, isn't it?
I am very hungry.
Hmm, that's why you haven't been sick for hours.
We'll eat tomorrow.
Or the day after.
Oh, dear.
We'll have to do something with you.
They'll put you in quarantine or something if you try to enter the country looking like that.
Nothing fancy.
You mustn't look like a tart.
Oh, Well, looking like a tart isn't going to be a problem.
This doesn't look too bad.
My sister gave me that.
Wear it with this... and this.
Open your bags ready for inspection.
Don't look too innocent, though.
I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.
Perhaps some eye-liner.
You step out of the line please.
Thank you.
Next, please.
Thank you.
Passport please.
Stand up straight.
Polish your shoes, and don't cough whatever you do.
Don't be rude, or pushy, and don't look too nervous.
This way!
Think like an American.
You have to know where you're going.
Welcome to the United States, Ma'am.
Through the blue door, please.
Next, please.
Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen.
Amen.
I saw you had a letter today, Diana.
Any news?
Mr. de Valera has had another operation on his eyes, she says.
He's been in Holland.
I don't want news that I can read in a newspaper.
Anyway, we would describe Mr. de Valera as "politics", would we not, Mrs. Kehoe?
And we do not like politics at the dinner table.
We don't.
It's not politics to talk about eye operations.
It is if the eyes belong to a politician.
And I do not like to talk about hospitals very much, either.
Patty, did you have any luck with that cold cream?
No, Mrs. Kehoe.
I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.
And I showed her the advertisement.
I don't want to have to travel all the way to Manhattan just for a jar of cold cream.
Maybe you could have a look at Bartocci's for me, Eilis?
Yes, Mrs. Kehoe.
Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.
She does not know for sure, Mrs. Kehoe.
She is only saying that Bartocci's is a better store than Webster's to get at Patty.
They are both very good, and you girls are very lucky to be working there.
Eilis, from the look of you, you have greasy skin, is that right?
What do you do about that?
Just...
Well, I wash it, Mrs. Kehoe, with soap.
There is nothing wrong with soap.
Soap was good enough for our Lord.
I expect.
Well, which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?
Does the Bible tell you that?
Our Lord was a man, anyway.
He didn't care about greasy skin.
Ladies.
No more talk about our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.
The girls will help you find something suitable,
Eilis, won't you, the girls?
- Hi.
- Good Morning.
Did you go out last night?
- Out.
The opposite of in.
- No.
Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.
"What did you see, Dorothy?"
"I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis.
They filmed it in Ireland."
"Oh, I'm from Ireland".
"I know you are, that's why I thought you might be interested."
Thank you.
Shouldn't be a moment.
Is it still hot out there?
I haven't been outside since this morning but I can tell that it might be.
Very.
It just..
looks it.
It's warm, yes.
Thanks very much.
Remember...
If people like it here, they will come back.
So you treat every customer as if she's a new friend.
I will try.
It's not a matter of trying.
It's what you have to do.
Do you try to wear panties every day?
No.
I mean, I don't..
I don't try.
I just put them on.
You see what I'm saying?
- Yes.
- Good.
Can I get another sliced toast please?
Slice up some hot dog.
They want them sliced down the middle!
Sorry.
Could I have the bill please?
I hope that when I go through the pearly gates, the first sound I hear is you asking me for the check in that lovely Irish brogue.
Have they told you a date for the nylon sale yet, Eilis?
We've never had a Bartocci's girl living here.
We might get some inside information.
I haven't been told anything.
I'll bet you wouldn't let on if you had.
She's that sort.
More loyal to her bosses than to her friends.
Like a Red spy.
Oh, dear God.
I'll thank you to keep His name out of a conversation about nylons.
He might be everywhere, but he's certainly not in Bartocci's on sale day.
Sorry Mrs. Kehoe.
I was glad to see you finally got some letters from home today, Eilis.
- Did I?
- Em.
I forgot to check.
They'll still be there after dinner.
Oh sorry.
Dear Eilis,
It's hard for me to believe that you're reading this in America.
Thousands of miles across the sea.
The big news here is that since you left,
Mummy has stopped shopping at Nettles Kelly's.
As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh.
And she overcharge for everything.
And she's awful.
I haven't told her to her face.
There's no need.
She knows that she overcharges and her bread's not fresh.
We talk about you every evening, of course.
We want to know everything.
I'm sure you're busy, but even if your letters were two hundred pages, they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.
Take care of yourself.
Love.
Is it your time of the month?
So what is it?
Take some time off now.
Go and sit in the staff room.
I'm so sorry, Eilis.
This is all my fault.
I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.
Franco Bartocci says you are doing great here.
Ma Kehoe says you are the nicest lodger she's ever had.
- What?
- Ma Kehoe?
Don't ever call her that to her face.
I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.
I've enrolled you in a night class.
For book-keeping.
The Brooklyn College.
It will be three nights a week.
And I've paid your tuition for the first semester.
- Why?
- "Why?"
Not "Thank you"?
Sorry, thank you.
But why?
I was amazed that someone as clever as you couldn't find proper work at home.
I've been here too long.
I forget what it's like in Ireland.
So when your sister wrote to me about you
I said that the Church would try to help.
Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.
I wish that I could stop feeling that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.
All I can say is that it will pass.
Homesickness is like most sicknesses.
It will make you feel wretched, and then it will move on to somebody else.
Now, Taylor versus Standard Gas Co is one of the most important corporate cases decided in the Supreme Court in the last twenty years.
This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock doctrine, so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.
In public utility integration proceedings alone literally thousands of investors may be affected by its application.
Did you understand any of that?
I mean, a single word?
He's not even reading from a book.
He just knows all this.
Well, Let's hope the next hour is easier.
One of the things that ruins Christmas in America is the turkey.
It all tastes of sawdust.
So that's one cheese sandwich for Miss McAdam, and extra turkey for everyone else.
Ladies, please.
Eilis, Father Flood told me about your Christmas plans.
Oh, you're not serving lunch to the old fellas who've nowhere to go, are you?
He asks us every year.
We always say no.
Ellis, you're a saint.
They smell awful.
Sheila knows how they smell because that's where she goes husband-hunting.
It's a marvelous thing you're doing, Eilis.
A Christian thing.
I wish there were more like you.
You can come.
How many are we expecting?
There were a hundred last year.
There may be more this.
- They all Irish?
- All Irish.
Why don't they go home?
If there's nothing there for a clever young girl such as yourself, there's gonna be even less for men like these.
Some of them have been here fifty years, they have lost touch with everyone.
Happy Christmas.
How are you?
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.
These are the men who built... the tunnels, the bridges, the highways.
God alone knows what they live on now.
I don't want to interrupt the proceedings, but I'm sure you'd all like to show your appreciation to all the ladies here for their hard day's work.
And by way of a thank you, we have a great singer in the room with us today.
Frankie.
Would you like to come into the front room for a glass of something?
You've earned it.
- You survived!
- Oh it wasn't so bad.
- Happy Christmas!
- Cheers.
Now Miss McAdam is leaving us.
She is going to live with her sister in Manhattan.
She has the best room in the house.
The basement.
And it has its own entrance.
Now, I can only let a certain kind of girl stay there.
Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.
Although I will admit that God did give Miss McAdam an advantage, when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.
No no, you're a pretty girl Eilis.
But you're sensible.
So, you're having the room and that's that.
Would the other girls not mind?
Oh, I expect so.
What don't they mind?
Girls, you'll take Dolores to dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?
There's a dance?
At the parish hall.
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.
Umm, Patty and I aren't going this week.
We're going to see a movie instead.
Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.
I would, very much.
There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.
Yes, surprising, isn't it?
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Of course, you'd be welcome to join us, Dolores.
So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.
So you both miraculously found boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?
Well, I hope you have more luck with these than you did with the last few.
- Will you be going, Eilis?
- Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
Well, you can take Dolores, then.
Of course.
God, there's nobody here.
How are we supposed to get a fella if there's nobody here?
I expect most people will come after nine.
People?
Or fellas?
Some of the people will be fellas.
I'd love to meet a fella.
They came!
The liars!
What a pair of bitches.
That's what the old woman called them.
She said they were all bitches, apart from you.
Well hello.
Hello.
It's good to see you.
I can see why.
Come with us.
There.
That's better.
Now you don't look like you came in from milking the cows.
Is that what I looked like?
Just a bit.
Nice clean cows.
1, 2, 3...
Not bad.
Maybe we could have a dance later?
- Sorry?
- A dance later.
Oh sure.
Would you like to dance?
Are you here with that guy?
The one who was teaching you to dance?
No.
So would you dance with me?
I'm not sure he taught me anything.
Doesn't matter.
The secret is to look as though you know what you're doing.
Ah.
I wish someone had told me that years ago.
Come on.
- Where do you live?
- Clinton Street.
Yeah?
That's on my way home.
Can I walk you?
I'm going to say yes, and then I'm going to tell you why.
So I don't get the wrong idea?
I suppose so.
Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?
You don't know her?
I do.
She lives in my boarding house, and she's awful.
If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.
You'd be rescuing me.
I get it.
- I'm not Irish.
- You don't sound Irish.
I need to make this clear.
No part of me is Irish.
I don't have Irish parents or grandparents or anything.
I'm an Italian.
Well, my my parents are, anyway.
So what were you doing at an Irish dance?
Don't the Italians have dances?
Yeah.
And I wouldn't want to take you to one.
They behave like Italians all night.
What does that mean?
- Oh, you know.
- No.
- Hands.
- Too many of them?
Oh, my.
I guess it could seem that way, if it was a girl.
Listen
I want everything out in the open.
I came to the Irish dance because I really like Irish girls.
And I was the only one who would dance with you?
Oh, no, it wasn't...
Oh, so you danced with loads of others?
This is me.
Can I take you next week?
Maybe get something to eat first?
That'd be nice.
Good night.
There you go.
So...
What do you do when you're not working?
Well.
There's school.
Just, you know...
Brooklyn College.
I'm studying book-keeping.
You want to be a book-keeper?
Well, I want to be an accountant one day.
But, yes, book-keeping first.
Wow.
Is that difficult?
I'm talking too much.
Tell me about plumbing.
- You know enough about plumbing already.
- I don't know anything.
You know that taps drip and toilets get blocked and that's all you need to know.
I don't know anything about book-keeping.
Well.
There's a lot to it.
There's all the maths, of course, but that's not so complicated.
The double entry system, that takes a while to get used to.
And we study company law, too, and that terrifies me.
So we had to read about an insurance company that went bankrupt in the 1930s, and all the the legal issues that went along with that...
She plays golf, and she's really good at it.
And if she'd been at the dance last Saturday, then...
I don't think you'd have looked at me twice, because Rose is beautiful.
I'm worried you haven't eaten anything.
Too busy talking.
What is the matter with you girls now?
Nothing is matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.
Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?
Eilis' young man?
We didn't know.
She won't say anything about it.
And why should she, to you awful gossip-mongers?
Anyway, I met him on Saturday night... when he called for Eilis, and he is a gentleman.
Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs Kehoe?
We know he's quite nice-looking.
I didn't like his shoes much.
What on earth is wrong with the shoes?
They were a funny color.
I'll tell you this much:
I am going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness.
I see now that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin.
A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man, and the noise she makes is a lot worse.
Now, enough.
Yeah.
Think about it.
You can...
Yeah, yeah.
All I want to do is travel home with you.
No food, no drink, no nothing.
I know you got to study and get some sleep.
I'll take you to your house and say goodnight.
Otherwise, it's too long to wait.
I want to ask you something.
And you're gonna say, "oh, it's too soon."
"I don't really know him well enough, we've only been out a couple times."
Oh, it's nothing so bad.
It is just something that most guys...
Please just ask.
You're beginning to terrify me.
Oh.
Sure.
Will you come for dinner and meet my family sometime?
That's it?
I'd love to.
You like italian food?
Don't know.
I've never eaten it.
It is the best food in the world.
Well, why would not I like it?
You're in a good mood, huh?
Yes, why?
It's just...
I like how you're being, I don't know the word.
When you go along with everything.
Amenable?
Yeah.
Amenable.
OK, so while you're being amenable..
Can we go see a movie this week when you're not in night classes?
I'll sign up for two movies.
- Really?
- Yes.
Even if the first date is a disaster,
I'll give it another chance.
It certainly feels like it, but this is my first year, so I don't know how to judge.
Well congratulations.
You survived your first New York winter.
Ah, it wasn't so bad.
Really?
It's colder in Ireland?
Oh no, it's colder here.
Over here, that's how we judge the winter.
On how cold it is.
But you have heating.
Heating everywhere.
You're only cold outside.
I guess that's true.
- Thank you for your help.
- Have a good day.
Eilis!
You're like a different person!
How did you do it?
Maybe I can pass some advice on to the next poor girl who feels that way.
I met somebody.
An Italian fella.
Oh no.
I'm not passing that on.
I'd rather have them homesick than heartbroken.
Does he talk about baseball all the time?
Or his mother?
No.
Then keep him.
There isn't another Italian man like him in New York.
Hold it.
Now remember You're getting off easy, because we haven't got sauce.
Yeah.
You have to remember that the sauce flies everywhere, so take it slowly.
I'm gonna say "Splash" anytime I see problems.
- Good idea.
- Can I start now?
- Yeah!
- Go!
SPLASH!
You just splashed his mother, and his father, and the walls...
Let's go again.
Dear Rose, I suppose the most important news is that I have a boyfriend.
He isn't as important as Bartocci's... and my evening classes, I know that.
But I wanted to tell you everything that is going on.
Please don't mention it to Mummy though.
You know what's she like.
He's decent and kind, and he has a job, and he works hard.
We go to the cinema on Wednesdays and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.
I think of you and mother every single day.
But Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here.
I didn't have before I met him.
My body was here, but my life was back in Ireland with you.
Now it's halfway across the sea.
So that's something, isn't it?
Oh and I'd better warned you about Frankie.
He's the little one.
Yeah.
He's eight going on eighteen.
He's nice and he's smart, but he's been talking and he's talking about all the things he's gonna to say to you.
- What sorts of things?
- We don't know.
Could be anything.
I mean, I swear I tried to pay him money to go out and play ball with his friends.
And my dad, he threatened him, but I think he's looking forward to causing trouble so much so he'll happily take a beating.
This is us here.
Ready?
Hey, how did you learn to eat spaghetti like that?
I've been taking lessons.
Lessons?
Like, in a class?
You can do that?
Maybe I could teach you.
No, no.
Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me... cooked me some spaghetti and made me try and eat it without making a mess.
So, what do you eat in Ireland?
Just Irish stew?
Not just.
We...
So first of all I should say that we don't like Irish people.
Hey, hey...
- Frankie!
- What?
We don't!
That is a well known fact!
Why Frankie?
Because a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up and he had to get stitches.
And because all the cops round here are Irish, nobody did anything about it.
There are probably two sides to it.
I might have said something I shouldn't, you know, I can't remember now.
No, because they beat you up.
Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.
No.
They just had red hair and big legs.
Raise up!
Excuse us.
All I can say in his defence is that he's the only one of us who'll get a college education.
If he can keep his mouth shut.
So, Tony tells me go to college.
Oh, just night classes.
I want to be a book-keeper.
I like working in the shop well enough, but I don't want to be there forever.
Good.
I'm sorry, Eilis.
I'm an idiot.I'm a rude idiot.
So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbett's Field when the season starts?
You like baseball?
He never mentioned the Dodgers?
Not even once?
Tony, what is the matter with you?
You know why?
Too much of this.
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbett's Field if you want to see him in the summer.
They're that important to you?
Put it this way.
If our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants, it would break my heart.
Mine too.
She's not laughing, Tony.
I think it's too late.
She's a Yanks fan.
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?
He's a Yanks fan.
I love you.
I..
Thank you for the evening.
It was lovely.
Sorry!
I'd finished.
Sheila can I ask you something?
Why are not you married?
Because my husband met somebody else and left me.
Oh I'm sorry.
And...
Well, would you get married again?
- Has somebody asked you?
- No, not really.
I won't ask what that means.
Sheila?
Would I get married again?
No.
I want to be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding-house, forever.
Of course, I do.
That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.
I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom.
While some bad-tempered fella, with hair growing out of his ears reads the newspaper on the toilet.
And then I'll wish I was back here, talking to you.
I'll catch you tomorrow right?
Eilis!
I'm sorry!
I did not think you were coming.
I know.
I thought you were gonna think that.
That's why I wanted to be here.
No matter what.
I need to say something...
Can you...
Can we talk about something else... until we get to Ms. Kehoe?
- It's Not...
- Please?
So.
Ten minutes before I'm supposed meet you... and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.
Yes.
Even if you were thinking of inviting me in for a coffee.
I would have to say no, for your sake.
So how did you fix it in ten minutes?
I didn't.
I spent the whole ten minutes explaining to the old lady that I had to be somewhere and I'd be back.
She didn't want to let me go.
So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?
Oh, what's the difference between six inches of sewage and a foot?
Let me say what I want to say.
I don't think you'll mind.
Okay.
You remember that after I had dinner at your house, you told me you loved me.
Well, I didn't really know what to say.
But I know what to say now.
I have thought about you.
And I like you, and I like being with you and...
Maybe, I feel the same way.
So the next time you tell me you love me, if there is a next time...
I'll say I love you too.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Holy shit!
Excuse my language, but...
I thought we were having a different kind of talk.
Can I go home now?
- You love Me?
- Yes.
But don't ask me anything else, and don't talk about our kids being Dodgers fans.
Oh what?
You want kids who like the Yankees?
Tony, please don't push me.
All right.
I'm sorry.
Dear Eilis,
Thank you so much for the nylons.
The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.
It seems everything is so exciting and new compared to here.
I can't wait for you to show it all to me one day.
Oh Eilis, you know I'm by your side, even when I'm not.
Well.
You're marvelous, that's all I have to say.
And it looks to me as if you didn't just pass those exams.
You, you flew through them.
I can't remember the last time anyone came here with good news.
I've saved some money.
I'll be able to pay for next year's tuition and pay you back for last year.
One of my parishioners paid.
He needed to do something for mankind, and I won't tell you why.
He is not out of the woods yet, either.
So he can cough up for next year, too.
I'd love to know what sort of woods he's in.
Yes, I'm sure you would, but you won't hear it from me.
Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.
You're not the miserable young girl who wanted to go home last winter.
Seems like years ago.
Now, I think this is the first time... any girl of mine has ever passed an exam, while living here.
Have you told Tony yet, Eilis?
Of course.
And is he taking you out to celebrate?
We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.
- Oh, boy!
- What does that mean?
Do you have a bathing costume?
- No, I was going to get one...
- Do you have sunglasses?
- No.
- You need sunglasses.
I read that if you don't have them on the beach this year people will talk about you.
And what exactly will they say, Sheila?
That's the thing, Mrs. Kehoe.
You'd never know, because they'd never say it to your face.
Oh, dear God!
Diana's right, though, Eilis.
You need to think carefully about your costume.
It's the most Tony will ever have seen of you.
You don't want to put him off.
You'll have to shave down there.
I'll give you a razor that will do the trick.
You're all right there for the moment.
And most Italian men appreciate the fuller figure.
But watch yourself, over the summer.
The black's too dark for your pale skin.
Let's see you in the green.
Look at that thing.
Why didn't you tell me to put my costume on underneath my clothes?
I thought you'd know.
Right, I'm ready.
- Tony!
- What?
Come on.
Dear Rose, Thanks for your letter.
I was happy to hear about your golf tournament.
You must have been really pleased.
I still miss you and mother, and I think about you every day.
But I think I can say that for the first time since I've been in America,
I'm really happy.
This is a lot to do with Tony.
At the weekend he took me to see the Brooklyn Dodgers, the baseball team he loves.
They lost, so he was annoyed.
But I've also started to look for office work, too.
I had an interview this week... at a textile firm here in Brooklyn.
Rose?
Who'd have thought that there would be two book-keepers in the family?
Rose?
I'll soon be able to afford to come home and see you and mummy.
Rose!
Rose?
Oh my God!
Oh God!
Rose?
Oh no!
A moment.
It was sudden.
I think perhaps she was ill, and she knew she was ill, and she didn't tell anybody.
What will happen?
What can happen?
- When will they bury her?
- Tomorrow.
- Without me.
- Without you.
You're too far away, Eilis.
Why did I ever come here?
Rose wanted a better life for you.
She loved how well you were doing.
But I will never see her again.
That's right, isn't it, Father?
I will never see her again.
You know that I think you will.
And she will be watching over you, every day, for the rest of your life.
Hello?
Mommy?
Can you hear me now?
Hello?
I can't really hear you.
Well, the rain held off, anyway.
And the whole of her golf club came.
Every single one of them.
We had a real houseful afterwards.
Are you still there?
Yes.
People really loved her, Eilis.
Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.
Nobody knew what to say to me.
When your daddy died, I said to myself that I shouldn't grieve too much because I had the two of you.
Then when you went to America, I told myself the same thing because she was here with me.
But everyone's gone, Eilis.
I have nobody.
I can't bear it, Tony.
You wanna go home, I guess.
And how would it be for you, if I did go home?
I'll be afraid, every single day.
- Afraid that I wouldn't come back?
- Yes.
Home is home.
I'm not sure if I have a home anymore.
You are not going to work tomorrow, are you?
After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?
This is it.
We're gonna build five houses here, if we can.
And mom and dad, they are gonna have one,
Cos ma always wanted a house with a backyard.
We'll sell three.
And the other one...
My brothers they asked me if I wanted it and I said that I did.
So, I guess what I'm saying is if you want to live out here on Long Island?
I mean I know it doesn't look like much right now, but all the land around here has been sold, so we wouldn't be on our own.
And there would be telephone cables, electricity and everything.
We're gonna set up a company, a building company, the three of us.
And I'm gonna do the plumbing and Lawrence is gonna do the carpentry.
Don't go all quiet on me.
At least tell me you'll think about it.
I don't need to think about it.
It's just for a month or so.
I know it would make her feel a little better.
Will you marry me before you leave?
You don't trust me to come back?
Marry me!
Marry me!
We don't have to tell anyone.
We just do it quickly, just keep it between us.
Why do you want to do it?
Because if we don't, I am gonna go crazy.
Would a promise not be the same?
If you can promise, you can easily do this.
So this is it?
This is where you live?
Yes, and if you make one tiny noise she'll evict me.
Oh, man!
Oh, man!
Oh, there's no point in worrying now.
Stay with me.
- Do you want to play?
- Yes, sure.
Alright.
Here we go, one bat coming up.
I'll take that, alright.
You ready?
Hands up.
Oh, right down to the third-base line.
Is he annoying you?
Because he is annoying me.
No no no.
I got a brother the exact same age?
Hey, are you Irish?
Is it so obvious?
I'm just about to marry an Irish girl, so I guess I notice it more.
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.
Sometimes it seems as though there can't be anybody left at home.
Where is your girl from?
Enniscorthy, in County Wexford.
I think my wife has family there.
Hey, Eilis!
Come here for a second.
Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.
Will we ever tell our children we did this?
Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.
I wonder what they'll think of it.
Nancy!
You look so glamorous!
I told you so.
- I'm so sorry about Rose.
- Thank you.
How are you?
No!
I knew.
But I wanted to let Nancy tell you herself.
- I am so glad you can come to the wedding.
- Can I?
Your mother accepted the invitation on your behalf.
- When is it?
- The 27th of August.
Will you come out with George and me tomorrow night?
Annette wants to see you, too.
Oh, I don't mind.
I'll have to find you a key.
I don't want you getting me out of bed.
We all want to hear what life in New York is like.
I'll try and think of something to say.
I'm booked to go back to New York on twenty-first.
Oh, you can wait an extra week to see your best friend married.
I can't believe I'm married to someone you'll never know.
But you'd like him.
I know you would.
He's sweet.
He's funny.
And he has got these wonderful eyes that...
I wish everything were different...
So, now.
Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.
Do we really have to do this?
Getting a letter of condolence isn't like getting a birthday present, is it?
What if Mrs. O'Toole from Cush writes back.
To thank you for your thank you?
Then I'll thank her.
And you'll be happy to spend the rest of your life like that?
It's not as if I have anything else to do.
Nor anybody else to talk to.
It might as well be Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.
What do you want me to say?
That would be Nancy and Annette.
Off you go.
Enjoy yourself.
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.
It's a great pleasure to meet you.
We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.
There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.
Okay.
Do you have to be with other fellas from the rugby club all the time?
No.
But Nancy told us that we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you.
Because you have too much to say to each other.
So we're just looking for company.
Oh, well.
Do you not like the fellas from the rugby club, Eilis?
I don't particularly, George.
When I first went to America,
I missed everything about Enniscorthy, except one.
We are not all the same.
You all look the same.
It's the blazer and the hair-oil.
Nancy, where is Annette?
And why has he come?
He's very nice, so don't be too hard on him.
Is this the same Jim Farrell that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?
What happened to her?
He broke it off.
He didn't think she was serious about him.
He was very upset for a while, but he's over her now.
Nancy, I'm going back.
But you can have a bit of fun while you're here, can't you?
Come on George.
How is your mother?
Well, she's sad.
And she's got much older very quickly.
It was a terrible thing.
We all went to the funeral mass.
My mother and my father and myself.
I did not know that.
My mother played golf with her, you know.
She is very fond of her.
It was the saddest thing that happened in the town that I can remember.
- Thank you.
- Come on you two.
- What about the skyscrapers?
- But that is Manhattan.
I live in Brooklyn and I work in Brooklyn.
And if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.
All the skyscrapers are across the river.
You don't make it sound very glamorous.
It's not, really.
Not even...
What do you call it?
The department store where you work?
Oh, Bartocci's?
Well, it sells lovely things, but I can't afford many of them... and I don't like the works.
What would you like to do?
I want to do what Rose did.
I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.
You should call in at Davis's.
They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.
I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.
But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.
I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.
Oh, you just want her to stay.
I am only thinking of Eilis.
Did you hear that Eilis?
He's only thinking of you.
That's it, that's it...
- Good night.
- Good night.
- See you.
- See you.
Bye.
- How's your evening?
- It's very nice, thank you.
Was that Jim Farrell I saw on the car with them?
It was.
His parents are moving, you know.
They're retiring to the country.
He'll be in that big house on his own.
Is that right?
It's a catch for "someone".
Goodnight Mommy.
- Hello Eilis.
- Hello Ms. Brennan..
I like her style.
- Thank Goodness you're back!
- What's the matter?
A lad from Davis's came round.
They have a problem in their accounts department.
- And they need you up there straight away.
- Is that all?
- I'll just put the shopping away.
- No, no, leave it.
"Straight away", the young fella said.
It doesn't matter what he said, Mother.
I'm not an employee.
I'd be doing them a favour.
Please let me do the shopping.
The problem is that it's our busy season, so all the middle workers and drivers did overtime last week.
Well, they filled out the overtime slips but there's been nobody to work it all out, to add to the wage slips.
And some of the men have started to complain.
And I can't blame them.
As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.
Well.
If you leave me for a couple of hours, I can work out a system so that whoever comes in after me won't have any trouble.
Hello, Eilis.
Maria has been telling me you have done the most marvellous job here.
Thank you.
We should have known you would, of course.
You're Rose's sister, after all.
I'm told you have a certificate in book-keeping?
Is it in American book-keeping?
I got the certificate in America, but the two systems are very similar.
Well, we'll certainly need someone to deal with wages and so on during the busy season.
So I'd like you to continue on a part-time basis.
Let's see how that goes and then we'll speak again.
I'll be going back to the United States soon.
As I said.
Lets you and I speak again before we make any firm decisions one way or the other.
Yes, Mr. Brown.
Of course.
Thank you.
Now, if you go and see Maria, she'll have your money for today.
- I'd forgotten.
- What?
This...
You have beaches in Brooklyn?
Yes, but they are just very crowded.
There will probably be quite a few walkers along here later.
Yes.
It's still not the same.
I'm sure it's not.
We don't really know anything of the rest of the world.
We must seem very backward to you now.
Of course not.
You seem calm, and civilised.
And charming.
Come on!
My mother wanted you to know that the golf club... is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.
A special trophy for the best score by a lady newcomer at the Club.
She was always very nice to the newcomers, my mother says.
I hope you're pleased.
Yes, of course.
So, every year, someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?
Every year.
As long as there's a golf club.
And I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.
Yeah and my mother would like to meet you too, by the way.
I'm supposed to arrange a time when you can come around for tea.
Thank you, I'd like that.
I wish it had been like this before I went.
- Before Rose died.
- Like what?
There was nothing here for me here before.
And now I have a job, and...
Here?
- Is that an American trick?
- Yes.
It's a good one, isn't it?
It's depressing, though, that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?
I mean how long have they known about it?
A hundred years, probably.
I don't think they had bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.
And we still don't have them now.
Well, come on.
You want to go see the Dodgers on Saturday?
Sure.
Okay, will you do something for me?
What?
If you laugh, or you say anything about this to anybody in the family, you don't get to see the Dodgers on Saturday.
Or any other day of the season.
Also, you get a beating.
Maybe it's just better if I don't get involved.
I really need your help Frankie.
You know you're the best writer and reader in the family?
Yes.
I'm trying to write to Eilis, and I want it to be, I don't know...
You wrote before already.
About five times.
Yeah, but they are no good Frankie and...
And she's only written back once.
She's never read my writing before.
I'm worried I'm putting her off me.
Listen, I'm eight years old, I don't know anything about kissing.
You don't need to know anything about kissing.
You need to know about spelling and... and...
- Grammar?
- Yeah, Will you look?
Dear Eilis, I hope that you're doing well in Ireland.
I hope that your mother is feeling less sad.
It will not be long before your friend gets married and you can come home.
This week it is like the whole world's basements are flooding.
I fixed three.
I've been working hard.
I've been saving money.
Everybody asks me about you all the time.
You missed out the "e" I think.
It is "everybody."
Anyway, I think that is all my news.
Mom and dad and all my brothers they all say hello.
I think about you most minutes of most days.
Even when I go see the Dodgers.
I do not concentrate on the game.
With love, your Tony.
No hair oil.
And that's not a blazer, it's a sports jacket.
Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?
Are you trying to trick me?
I knew what you meant, when you said we're all the same.
It made me think that my life must seem very east to you.
I run my father's bar, going to live in my parents' house.
I know what that must look like from the outside.
But it doesn't feel like that.
What does it feel like?
I've never been anywhere.
I have never even been to England.
But I'd like to see London, and Paris and Rome.
New York.
It frightens me, the idea of dying without ever leaving Ireland.
And there are other things too...
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to ask you a thousand things and all I've done is talked.
I am glad.
- Really?
- Yes.
Will you finsh that wretched pipe and sit with us?
I can hear perfectly well from where I am.
We are not here to provide you with entertainment.
Oh, don't you worry.
I found that out many years ago.
Just ignore him, Eilis.
It's as well Jim takes after me, but him.
Speak up!
Are you looking forward to your move?
Ah, I will miss Enniscorthy.
But it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.
My mother's worried about leaving me here on me own.
She thinks I'll destroy the place.
I'm hoping you won't be on your own forever.
I'm sure he won't.
I mean...
- God, aren't we blessed with this weather.
- It's lovely.
Dear Tony, thank you for your letters.
I want you to know that...
I don't know what I want you to know.
I don't want to be sitting right at the back.
I'll make sure you get the best seats in the house.
Oh, it wouldn't feel right sitting up there with Nancy and George.
We'll find the second best seats in the house then.
Would you like me to run ahead and save you a couple of places, Mrs. Lacey?
Would you mind Jim?
That would be grand.
- Such a gentleman, isn't he?
- He is.
He came along at just the right time for us.
I invite you now Nancy, to declare before God and his church... your consent to become George's wife.
I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.
I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.
The rings.
Lord, bless these rings, grant that those who wear them may always be faithful to each other.
May they do your will and live in peace with you, and mutual love.
We ask this through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Amen.
Your mother tells me things are working out for you very well in Enniscorthy, Eilis.
It was a lovely service.
And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving out to Glenbrien, so Jim will...
Yes, I know.
Jim and I promised my mother we'd take her back to the car.
Oh, do you hear that? "Jim and I!
Jim and I!".
It won't be long now, by the sound of it, and your mother will have a wonderful day out.
Will you excuse me?
Can we talk?
- What about?
- The future.
I can't let you just go back to America without saying anything.
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.
So, I don't want you to go.
I want you to stay here, with me.
And I know that means asking you another question,
But I don't want to bombard you.
So I'll save that one for later.
Thank you.
I'm grateful.
And I'm flattered.
- That's all?
- No.
No, of course not.
It is just...
I'd imagined a different life for myself.
I understand.
But your life here could be just as good.
Better, even, maybe.
Mary!
I was just coming to fetch you.
To fetch me?
I haven't worked for Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary.
Oh, Please come Eilis.
She told me not to come back without you.
You know what she's like.
You look after things for five minutes while I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.
There are no customers in there at the moment, so I don't think you can make too much of a mess of things.
So.
How have you been getting on?
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.
I heard that you're working over at Davis's?
In the accounts department?
That's right.
And there's lots of talk about you and young Jim Farrell.
Ah, well.
You know what people are like.
They love to talk.
Yes.
Do you remember Mrs. Brady?
She usually comes into the shop on Sunday morning for her rashers.
No?
Well, you have a very busy life now.
What with one thing and another.
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece living in Brooklyn.
The world is a small place, isn't it?
She had a letter from her a couple of weeks back.
And what did it say?
Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding at the city hall, and her husband bumped into a girl from Enniscorthy who was getting married there.
I'm not sure what you're telling me, Miss Kelly.
He didn't bump into me.
Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.
Although I'm not sure that that's your name any longer, is it?
He couldn't remember.
Something Italian, he thought.
I'd forgotten.
You'd forgotten!
What a thing for...
I'd forgotten what this town is like.
What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?
Keep me away from Jim?
Stop me from going back to America?
Perhaps you didn't even know.
My name is Eilis Fiorello.
- Thank you.
- How I can help you?
Hello, I'd like to make a reservation for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.
I think people spend even more money after a wedding.
Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.
She was buying firelighters in Broom's.
Firelighters!
In August!
But she'd seen Mrs. Stapleton in there, and she hadn't had a chance to go through the whole day in detail with her, so...
Eilis, what's the matter?
Has something happened with Jim?
Mommy, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm married.
I got married in Brooklyn before I came home.
I should have told you.
I should have told you as soon as I got back.
I want to be with him.
I want to be with my husband.
Of course.
Is he nice?
Yes.
He'd have to be nice, if you married him.
So you are going back?
Yes.
Tomorrow.
Are you on the early train?
I'm going to bed.
Mummy...
It's not even eight o'clock.
You don't have to..
I'm very tired.
And I'd like to say goodbye now, and only once.
Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.
I will.
Goodnight Eilis.
So are you away to live in America?
- No.
- Just visiting?
No.
I live there already.
Really?
What's it like?
It's a big place.
I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York.
Do you know it?
Yes.
People say that there's so many Irish people there.
It's like home.
Is that right?
Yes, it's just like home.
You're not to eat.
But I might be there years.
No, you can eat when you get there.
Don't eat on the boat.
It'll stop you getting so sick.
Do you promise me?
I promise.
And in a moment, I want you to go straight down to your cabin and lock the bathroom door on your side.
When next door starts hammering, you can negotiate.
When you get to Immigration, keep your eyes wide open,
Look as if you know where you're going.
You have to think like an American.
Could you please step forward?
You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die, and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.
But you will, and it won't kill you.
And one day the sun will come out and you might not even note it straight away, it would be that faint.
And then you will catch yourself thinking about something or or someone who has no connection with the past,
Someone who's only yours.
And you'll realise that this is where your life is.
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?
Not if what you're going to say will cause trouble for me in some way or another.
9:00 mass is over, girls.
- Now.
- Thank you.
- One moment, please.
- Excuse me.
And some rashers and some cheese.
Mrs Brady, what would you like this morning?
- Half a dozen rashers, please.
- Of course.
Eilis will get that for you now.
- I was next.
- And you still are.
- Yes?
- I need some shoe polish.
Shoe polish?
That's not really a Sunday item, now, is it?
These people need things for their dinner or their tea.
Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?
Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.
I'm sorry.
Miss Kelly...
I hadn't forgotten.
Spit it out, whatever it is.
I'm away to America.
Whose idea was that?
Father Flood in New York arranged it.
Rose used to play golf with him.
He sponsored me.
And he found me a job and got me a visa.
Well, we won't be needing you back here.
I could work every Sunday till I go.
No, thank you.
- Your poor sister.
- My sister?
Well, mothers are always being left behind in this country.
But Rose, that's the end for her now, isn't it?
She'll be looking after your mother for the rest of her life.
I wish I'd written to Father Flood about you, Rose.
Me?
I have a job.
You had a couple of hours on a Sunday working for Nettles Kelly.
You shouldn't call her that.
I think it's quite a kind name.
Considering she's actually a terrible old witch.
Well, I don't want to talk about her any more.
Good.
They say it's hotter there in the summer and colder in the winter.
What in heaven's name will she do about clothes?
She'll buy them, Mother.
She doesn't want to be wasting her money on clothes.
She won't have much choice.
She'll be there for...
- You look beautiful, Nancy.
- Thank you.
You look so beautiful.
It makes me despair of this place.
Why?
Well, you're the prettiest girl in County Wexford.
You should be able to choose any man you want and we're hoping that George Sheridan from the rugby club looks your way.
Do you think he might?
Of course he will.
I know you like him, Nancy, but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?
And those boys with their hair oil and their blazers.
- He has beautiful eyes.
- Mmm...
And he's going to come into a beautiful shop in the market square.
Why didn't you wear your blue dress?
Are you asking why I didn't make more of an effort?
I suppose cos I'm going away.
Mind, now.
Come on.
He's looked over here twice already.
He hasn't!
- He's walking over here now.
- He's not!
Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridan's doing?
Would you like to dance?
Is that really everything you own?
Oh, Eilis.
I should have looked after you better.
You've bought most of the clothes in this case.
That's one of the reasons I'm going, cos I can't buy my own.
If it was just that, I'd spend every penny I had on you.
Gladly.
But I can't buy you a future.
I can't buy you the kind of life you need.
I know.
But you'll come see me there one day?
Yes.
And you'll look after yourself?
You don't have to worry about me.
And I'll come home to visit, won't I?
Cos I couldn't bear it if...
You haven't packed your shoes yet.
They'll take up a bit of room.
There.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Off.
Number one, bottom bunk, that's mine.
You're on the top.
This is hell.
- Never again.
- Never again to America?
The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.
I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.
Let's go for a smoke.
I don't.
Suit yourself.
I'll see you later.
Unless I find a nice man in First to smoke with.
It's good to see that not everybody's put off their dinner by the weather forecast.
It's supposed to be a rough one tonight, so none of the other passengers are eating.
A few spoonfuls of soup maybe, but not the mutton stew.
Please unlock it.
Go away!
I'm sorry about the smell.
And the bucket.
Don't worry.
The whole boat stinks.
Even First Class.
I've just been thrown out of there, by the way.
The bathroom door was locked all night.
Oh, those bastards.
There.
Won't be very comfortable, but at least it's ours.
- Open the door.
- Feck off.
- Open the door right now.
- Do you hear me?
Fuck off.
If you'd been nice last night, we would have played fair.
- Now you've got no toilet.
- Get out of the bathroom.
You bastards.
Go on, you can use it.
I'm going to get us some water.
That's all you're allowed.
Are you going to live in America?
Yes.
You have papers and everything?
Yes.
And a job.
How'd you manage to arrange all that?
I didn't.
Someone did it for me.
A priest my sister knows.
And how do you feel about it?
How long do letters from Ireland take to arrive?
My sister Rose said she'd write straightaway.
They take a long time at first.
And then no time at all.
You have family in America?
Friends?
No.
You'll meet people easily enough.
Where are you gonna live?
Brooklyn?
- How'd you know that?
- Lucky guess.
Try to remember that sometimes it's nice to talk to people who don't know your auntie.
That's what it's like?
That's what it's like.
I haven't been sick for hours.
Nice, isn't it?
I'm very hungry.
That's why you haven't been sick for hours.
We'll eat tomorrow.
Or the day after.
Oh, dear.
We're gonna have to do something with you.
They'll put you in quarantine or something if you try and enter the country looking like that.
Nothing fancy.
You mustn't look like a tart.
Oh, well, looking like a tart isn't going to be a problem.
This doesn't look too bad.
My sister gave me that.
Wear it with this and... this.
Have your bags ready for inspection.
Don't look too innocent, though.
I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.
Perhaps a little eye liner.
Step out of the line, please.
Thank you.
Next, please.
Thank you.
Step over this way, please.
Get out of the line.
Next.
Passport, please.
Stand up straight.
Polish your shoes.
And don't cough, whatever you do.
Over this way.
Don't be rude or pushy, but don't look too nervous.
Step this way.
Think like an American.
You have to know where you're going.
Welcome to the United States, ma'am.
Through the blue door, please.
Next, please.
Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, amen.
Amen.
I saw you had a letter today, Diana.
Any news?
Mr de Valera's had another operation on his eyes, she says.
He's been in Holland.
I don't want news I can read in a newspaper.
Anyway, we would describe Mr de Valera as politics, would we not, Mrs Kehoe?
And we do not like politics at the dinner table.
We don't.
It's not politics to talk about eye operations.
It is if the eyes belong to a politician.
And I don't like to talk about hospitals very much either.
Patty, did you have any luck with that cold cream?
No, Mrs Kehoe.
I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.
And I showed her the advertisement.
I don't want to have to travel all the way into Manhattan just for a jar of cold cream.
Maybe you could have a look in Bartocci's for me, Eilis?
Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.
She doesn't know that for sure, Mrs Kehoe.
She's only saying that Bartocci's is a better store than Webster's to get at Patty.
They're both very good and you girls are very lucky to be working there.
Eilis, from the look of you, you have greasy skin.
Is that right?
What do you do about that?
Just...
Well, I wash it, Mrs Kehoe, with soap.
There's nothing wrong with soap.
Soap was good enough for Our Lord, I expect.
Oh, and which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?
Does the Bible tell you that?
Our Lord was a man, anyway.
He didn't care about greasy skin.
Ladies, no more talk about Our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.
The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis.
- Won't you, girls?
- Mmm-hmm.
Hi.
- Good morning.
- Did you go out last night?
- Out, the opposite of in.
- No.
Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.
"What did you see, Dorothy?"
"I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis.
They filmed it in Ireland."
"Oh, I'm from Ireland."
"I know you are.
That's why I thought you might be interested."
Thank you.
Shouldn't be a moment.
Is it still hot out there?
I haven't been outside since this morning.
But I can tell that it might be very.
It just looks it.
It's warm, yes.
Thanks very much.
Remember, if people like it here, they'll come back, so you treat every customer as if she's a new friend.
- I'll try.
- It's not a matter of trying.
It's what you have to do.
Do you try to wear panties every day?
No.
I mean, I don't...
I don't try.
I just put them on.
You see what I'm saying?
Yes.
Good.
Can we get another side of toast, please?
Slice up some hot dogs.
They want 'em sliced down the middle.
Sorry.
Could I have the bill, please?
I hope that when I go through the Pearly Gates, the first sound I hear is you asking me for the cheque in that lovely Irish brogue.
Diana?
Have they told you a date for the nylon sale yet, Eilis?
Never had a Bartocci's girl living here.
Might get some inside information.
I haven't been told anything.
- I bet you wouldn't let on if you had.
- She's that sort.
More loyal to her bosses than to her friends.
- Like a Red spy.
- Oh, dear God.
I'll thank you to keep His name out of a conversation about nylons.
He might be everywhere, but he's certainly not in Bartocci's on sale day.
Sorry, Mrs Kehoe.
I was glad to see you finally got some letters from home today, Eilis.
Did I?
I forgot to check.
They'll still be there after dinner.
Sorry.
Dear Eilis.
It's hard for me to believe that you're reading this in America, thousands of miles across the sea.
The big news here is that since you left,
Mammy has stopped shopping at Nettles Kelly's.
As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh and she overcharged for everything...
And she's awful.
I haven't told her to her face.
There's no need.
She knows that she overcharges and her bread's not fresh.
We talk about you every evening, of course.
We want to know everything.
I'm sure you're busy, but even if your letters were 200 pages, they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.
Take care of yourself.
Love.
Is it your time of the month?
So what is it?
Take some time off now.
Go and sit in the staff room.
I'm so sorry, Eilis.
This is all my fault.
I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.
Franco Bartocci says you're doing great here.
Ma Kehoe says you're the nicest lodger she's ever had.
- What?
- "Ma Kehoe"?
Don't ever call her that to her face.
I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.
I've enrolled you in a night class, for book-keeping.
Brooklyn College.
It'll be three nights a week and I've paid your tuition for the first semester.
- Why?
- Why?
Not thank you?
Sorry.
Thank you.
But why?
Well, I was amazed that someone as clever as you couldn't find proper work at home.
I've been here too long.
I forget what it's like in Ireland.
So when your sister wrote to me about you,
I said the Church would try to help.
Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.
I wish that I could stop feeling that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.
All I can say is that it will pass.
Homesickness is like most sicknesses.
It'll make you feel wretched and then it'll move on to somebody else.
Now, Taylor v. Standard Gas Company is one of the most important corporate cases decided in the Supreme Court in the last 20 years.
This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock Doctrine, so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.
In public utility integration proceedings alone, literally thousands of investors may be affected by its application.
Did you understand any of that?
I mean, a single word?
He's not even reading from a book.
He just knows all this.
Well, let's hope the next hour's easier, huh?
One of the things that ruins Christmas in America is the turkey.
It all tastes of sawdust.
So that's one cheese sandwich for Miss McAdam and extra turkey for everyone else.
Ladies, please.
Eilis, Father Flood told me about your Christmas plans.
Oh, you're not serving lunch to the old fellas who've nowhere to go, are you?
He asks us every year.
We always say no.
Eilis, you're a saint.
They smell awful.
Sheila knows how they smell because that's where she goes husband hunting.
It's a marvellous thing you're doing, Eilis.
A Christian thing.
I wish there were more like you.
In you come.
How many are we expecting?
We had a hundred last year.
There may be more this.
- Are they all Irish?
- All Irish.
Why don't they go home?
If there's nothing there for clever young girls such as yourself, there's gonna be even less for men like these.
Some of them have been here 50 years.
They've lost touch with everyone.
Lovely.
Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.
These are the men who built the tunnels, the bridges, the highways.
God alone knows what they live on now.
Anyway...
I don't want to interrupt proceedings, but I'm sure you'd all like to show your appreciation to all the ladies here for their hard day's work.
And by way of a thank you, we have a great singer in the room with us today.
Frankie.
Mind yourself, there.
Would you like to come into the front room for a glass of something?
You've earned it.
You survived.
Ah...
It wasn't so bad.
- Happy Christmas.
- Cheers.
Now, Miss McAdam is leaving us.
She's going to live with her sister in Manhattan.
She has the best room in the house, the basement, and it has its own entrance.
Now, I can only let a certain kind of girl stay there.
Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.
Although I will admit, God did give Miss McAdam an advantage when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.
No, no, you're a pretty girl, Eilis, but you're sensible.
So, you're having the room and that's that.
Will the other girls not mind?
Oh, I expect so.
What don't they mind?
Girls, you'll take Dolores to the dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?
There's a dance?
At the parish hall.
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.
Um...
Patty and I aren't going this week.
We're going to see a movie instead.
Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.
I would, very much.
There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.
Yes, surprising, isn't it?
You'd think it'd be the other way round.
Of course, you would be welcome to join us, Dolores.
So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.
So you both miraculously found boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?
Well, I hope you have more luck with these than you did with the last few.
- Will you be going, Eilis?
- Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
Well, you can take Dolores, then.
Of course.
God.
There's nobody here.
How are we supposed to get a fella if there's nobody here?
I expect most people will come after 9:00.
People or fellas?
Some of the people will be fellas.
I'd love to meet a fella.
They came.
The liars.
What a pair of bitches.
That's what the old woman called them.
She said they were all bitches.
Apart from you.
Well, hello.
- Hello.
It's good to see you.
- I can see why.
Come with us.
There.
That's better.
Now you don't look like you came in from milking the cows.
- Is that what I looked like?
- Just a bit.
Nice, clean cows.
One, two, three.
Two, two, three.
Not bad.
Two...
Maybe we can have a dance later.
I'm sorry?
- A dance, later.
- Oh.
Sure.
Would you like to dance?
Are you here with that guy, the one who was teaching you to dance?
- No.
- So would you dance with me?
I'm not sure he taught me anything.
Doesn't matter.
Secret is to look as though you know what you're doing.
I wish someone had told me that years ago.
Come on.
Where do you live?
- Clinton Street.
- Yeah?
That's on my way home.
Can I walk you?
I'm going to say yes and then I'm going to tell you why.
So I don't get the wrong idea?
I suppose so.
Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?
- You don't know her?
- I do.
She lives in my boarding house and she's awful.
If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.
- You'd be rescuing me.
- I get it.
I'm not Irish.
You don't sound Irish.
I need to make this clear.
No part of me is Irish.
I don't have Irish parents or grandparents or anything.
I'm Italian.
Well, my parents are, anyway.
So what were you doing at an Irish dance?
Don't the Italians have dances?
Yeah, and I wouldn't wanna take you to one.
They behave like Italians all night.
- What does that mean?
- Oh, you know.
No.
Hands.
Too many of them?
I guess it could seem that way if you was a girl.
Listen...
I want everything out in the open.
I came to the Irish dance... because I really like Irish girls.
And I was the only one who would dance with you?
Oh, no, it wasn't...
Oh, so you danced with loads of others?
This is me.
Can I take you next week, maybe get something to eat first?
That'd be nice.
Good night.
So...
What do you do when you're not working?
Well, there's school.
Just, you know, Brooklyn College.
I'm studying book-keeping.
You wanna be a book-keeper?
Well, I want to be an accountant one day, but, yes, book-keeping first.
- Wow.
- Mmm.
Is that difficult?
I'm talking too much.
Tell me about plumbing.
You know enough about plumbing already.
I don't know anything.
You know that taps drip and that toilets get blocked and that's all you need to know.
I mean, I don't know anything about book-keeping.
Well, there's a lot to it.
There's all the maths, of course, but that's not so complicated.
The double-entry system, that takes a while to get used to.
And we study company law too and that terrifies me.
So we had to read about an insurance company that went bankrupt in the 1930s and all the legal issues that went along with that.
She plays golf and she's really good at it and if she'd been at the dance last Saturday, then I don't think you'd have looked at me twice because Rose is beautiful.
I'm worried.
You haven't eaten anything.
Oh.
Too busy talking.
What is the matter with you girls now?
Nothing is the matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.
Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?
Eilis has a young man?
We didn't know.
She won't say anything about it.
And why should she to you awful gossipmongers?
Anyway, I met him on Saturday night when he called for Eilis, and he's a gentleman.
Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs Kehoe?
We know he's quite nice-looking.
Didn't like his shoes much.
What on Earth is wrong with his shoes?
They were a funny colour.
I'll tell you this much.
I'm going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness.
I see now that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin.
A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man, and the noise she makes is a lot worse.
Now, enough.
All I wanna do is travel home with you.
No food, no drink, no nothing.
I know you gotta study and get some sleep.
I'll take you to your house and say good night.
Otherwise, it's too long to wait.
I wanna ask you something and you're gonna say,
"Oh, it's too soon.
I don't really know him well enough.
"We only been out a couple of times."
Oh, it's nothing so bad.
It's just something that most guys, they...
Please just ask.
You're beginning to terrify me.
Oh...
Sure.
Will you come for dinner and meet my family sometime?
That's it?
I'd love to.
You like Italian food?
Don't know.
I've never eaten it.
It's the best food in the world.
Well, why would I not like it?
You're in a good mood, huh?
Yes.
Why?
It's just...
I like how you're being.
I don't know the word, when you go along with everything.
- Amenable.
- Yeah?
Amenable?
OK, so while you're being amenable, can we go see a movie this week when you're not in night class?
I'll sign up for two movies.
- Really?
- Yes.
Even if the first date is a disaster, I'll give it another chance.
Parkway's next stop.
Parkway's next.
It certainly feels like it, but this is my first year, so I don't know how to judge.
Well, congratulations.
You've survived your first New York winter.
Ah.
Wasn't so bad.
Really?
It's colder in Ireland?
Oh, no, it's colder here.
Over here that's how we judge the winter, on how cold it is.
But you have heating, heating everywhere.
You're only cold outside.
I guess that's true.
- Thank you for your help.
- Have a good day.
Eilis.
You're like a different person.
How did you do it?
Maybe I can pass some advice on to the next poor girl who feels that way.
I met somebody.
An Italian fella.
Oh, no.
I'm not passing that on.
I'd rather have them homesick than heartbroken.
Does he talk about baseball all the time?
- Or his mother?
- No.
Then keep him.
There isn't another Italian man like him in New York.
Hold it.
Now, remember you're getting off easy because we haven't got sauce.
Yeah, you have to remember that the sauce flies everywhere, so take it slowly.
I'm gonna say "splash" any time I see problems.
- Good idea.
- Can I start now?
- Yeah.
- Go.
Splash!
You just splashed his mother, his father, and the walls.
Let's go again.
Dear Rose.
I suppose the most important news is that I have a boyfriend.
He isn't as important as Bartocci's and my night classes, I know that, but I want to tell you everything that's going on.
Please don't mention it to Mammy, though.
You know what she's like.
He's decent and kind, and he has a job and he works hard.
We go to the cinema on Wednesdays and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.
I think of you and Mother every single day, but Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here
I didn't have before I met him.
My body was here, but my life was back in Ireland with you.
Now it's halfway across the sea.
So that's something, isn't it?
Oh, and I'd better warn you about Frankie.
- He's the little one?
- Yeah, he's eight going on 18.
I mean, he's nice and he's smart, but he's been talking and he's talking about all the things he's gonna say to you.
- What sort of things?
- We don't know.
It could be anything.
I mean, I tried to pay him money to go out and play ball with his friends and my dad, he threatened him, but I think he's looking forward to causing trouble, so much so he'll happily take a beating.
This is us here.
You ready?
Hey, how did you learn to eat spaghetti like that?
- I've been taking lessons.
- Lessons?
Like in a class?
You can do that?
Maybe I could teach it.
No, no, Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me cooked me some spaghetti and made me try and eat it without making a mess.
So what do you eat in Ireland?
Just Irish stew?
Not just.
We eat...
So, first of all, I should say that we don't like Irish people.
- Hey, watch it.
- Frankie.
What?
We don't.
That is a well-known fact.
Why, Frankie?
Cos a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up and he had to get stitches, and because all the cops around here are Irish nobody did anything about it.
There's probably two sides to it.
I might have said something I shouldn't.
You know, I can't remember now.
No, because they beat you up.
Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.
No, they just had red hair and big legs.
All right, up.
- Ow!
- Excuse us.
All I can say in his defence is he's the only one of us who'll get a college education.
If he can keep his mouth shut.
So, Tony tells me you go to college.
Oh, just night classes.
I want to be a book-keeper.
I like working in the shop well enough, but I don't want to be there forever.
I'm sorry, Eilis.
I'm an idiot.
I'm a rude idiot.
So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbets Field when the season starts?
You like baseball?
He never mentioned the Dodgers?
Not even once?
Tony, what's the matter with you?
You wanna know why?
Too much of this.
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbets Field if you wanna see him in the summer.
They're that important to you?
Put it this way, if our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants,
- it'd break my heart.
- Mine too.
She's not laughing, Tony.
Think it's too late.
She's a Yanks fan.
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?
She's a Yanks fan.
I love you.
I...
Thank you for the evening.
It was lovely.
Oh!
Sorry.
I'd finished.
Sheila, can I ask you something?
Why aren't you married?
Because my husband met somebody else and left me.
Oh...
I'm sorry.
And, well, would you get married again?
- Has somebody asked you?
- No.
Not really.
I won't ask what that means.
Would I get married again?
No, I wanna be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding house forever.
Of course I do.
That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.
I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom while some bad-tempered fella with hair growing out of his ears reads the newspaper on the toilet.
Then I'll wish I was back here talking to you.
Eilis!
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were coming.
Yeah, I know.
I thought you were gonna think that.
That's why I wanted to be here no matter what.
- I need to say something to you.
- Can you...
Can we just talk about something else until we get to Mrs Kehoe's?
- It's not...
- Please.
So...
Ten minutes before I'm supposed to meet you and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.
Yeah.
Even if you're thinking of inviting me in for a coffee,
I'd have to say no for your sake.
So how did you fix it in 10 minutes?
I didn't.
I spent the whole 10 minutes explaining to the lady
I had to be somewhere and I'd be back, and she don't wanna let me go.
So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?
Oh...
Well, what's the difference between six inches of sewage and a foot?
Will you let me say what I want to say?
I don't think you'll mind.
OK.
You remember that after I had dinner at your house, you told me you loved me?
Well, I didn't really know what to say.
But I know what to say now.
I have thought about you, and I like you.
And I like being with you.
And... maybe I feel the same way.
So the next time you tell me you love me, if there is a next time...
I'll say I love you too.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Holy shit.
Excuse my language, but I thought we were having a different kind of talk.
Can I go home now?
You love me?
Yes, but don't ask me anything else, and don't talk about our kids being Dodgers fans.
What, you want kids who like the Yankees?
- Tony, please, don't push me.
- All right.
I'm sorry.
Dear Eilis.
Thank you so much for the nylons.
The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.
It seems everything is so exciting and new compared to here.
I can't wait for you to show it all to me one day.
Oh, Eilis, you know I'm by your side, even when I'm not.
Well...
You're marvellous, that's all I have to say.
It looks to me as if you didn't just pass those exams.
No.
You flew through them.
I can't remember the last time anyone came in here with good news.
I've saved some money.
I'll be able to pay for next year's tuition and pay you back for last year.
One of my parishioners paid.
He needed to do something for mankind and I won't tell you why.
He's not out of the woods yet either, so he can cough up for next year, too.
I'd love to know what sort of woods he's in.
Yes, I'm sure you would, but you won't hear it from me.
Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.
You're not the miserable young girl who wanted to go home last winter.
It seems like years ago.
Now, I think this is the first time any girl of mine has ever passed an exam while living here.
- Have you told Tony yet, Eilis?
- Of course.
And is he taking you out to celebrate?
We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.
- Oh, boy.
- What does that mean?
Do you have a bathing costume?
- No, I was going to...
- Do you have sunglasses?
- No.
- You need sunglasses.
I read that if you don't have them on the beach this year, people'll talk about you.
And what exactly will they say, Sheila?
That's the thing, Mrs Kehoe.
You'd never know cos they'd never say it to your face.
Oh, dear God.
Diana's right, though, Eilis.
You need to think carefully about your costume.
It's the most Tony will ever have seen of you and you don't want to put him off.
You'll have to shave down there.
I'll give you a razor that'll do the trick.
You're all right there for the moment.
And most Italian men appreciate a fuller figure.
But watch yourself over the summer.
Black's too dark for your pale skin.
Let's see you in the green.
Why didn't you tell me to put my costume on underneath my clothes?
I thought you'd know.
Right, I'm ready.
- Tony.
- What?
Come on.
Dear Rose.
Thank you for your letter.
I was happy to hear about your golf tournament.
You must have been really pleased.
I still miss you and Mother and think about you every day, but I think I can say that for the first time since I've been in America
I'm really happy.
This has a lot to do with Tony.
At the weekend he took me to see the Brooklyn Dodgers, the baseball team he loves.
They lost, so he was annoyed.
But I've also started to look for office work too.
I had an interview this week at a textile firm here in Brooklyn.
Rose.
Who'd have thought there would be two book-keepers in the family?
Rose.
I'll soon be able to afford to come home and see you and Mammy.
Rose?
Rose.
Oh, my God.
Rose!
Oh, Rose!
One moment.
It was sudden.
I think perhaps she was ill, and she knew she was ill, and she didn't tell anybody.
- What'll happen?
- What can happen?
When will they bury her?
Tomorrow.
- Without me?
- Without you.
You're too far away, Eilis.
Why did I ever come here?
Rose wanted a better life for you.
She loved how well you were doing.
But I'll never see her again.
That's right, isn't it, Father?
I'll never see her again.
You know that I think you will.
And that she'll be watching over you every day for the rest of your life.
Hello.
Mammy?
I can't really hear you.
Well, the rain held off anyway.
And the whole of her golf club came, every single one of them.
We had a real houseful afterwards.
Are you still there?
Yes.
People really loved her, Eilis.
Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.
Nobody knew what to say to me.
When your daddy died, I said to myself that I shouldn't grieve too much because I had the two of you.
And then when you went to America,
I told myself the same thing because she was here with me.
But everyone's gone, Eilis.
I have nobody.
I can't bear it, Tony.
You wanna go home, I guess.
How would it be for you if I did go home?
I'd be afraid every single day.
Afraid that I wouldn't come back?
Yeah.
But home is home.
I'm not sure I have a home any more.
You're not going to work tomorrow, are you?
After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?
This is it.
We're gonna build five houses here if we can and Mom and Dad, they're gonna have one cos Ma always wanted a house with a backyard.
We'll sell three.
And the other one, my brothers, they asked me if I wanted it and I said that I did.
So I guess what I'm saying is, you wanna live out here on Long Island?
I mean, I know it doesn't look like much right now, but all the land around here has been sold, so we wouldn't be on our own, and there'd be telephone cables and electricity, everything.
We're gonna set up a company.
A building company, the three of us.
And I'm gonna do the plumbing and Laurence'll do the carpentry and...
Don't go all quiet on me.
At least tell me you'll think about it.
I don't need to think about it.
It's just for a month or so.
I know it'd make her feel a little better.
Will you marry me before you leave?
You don't trust me to come back?
Marry me.
Marry me.
We don't have to tell anybody.
We just do it quickly, just keep it between us.
Why do you want to do it?
Because if we don't, I'm gonna go crazy.
Would a promise not be the same?
If you can promise, you can easily do this.
So this is it.
This is where you live.
Yes, and if you make one tiny noise, she'll evict me.
There's no point in worrying now.
Stay with me.
You wanna play?
- Yeah, sure.
- All right, here we go.
One bat coming up, huh?
I'll take that.
All right, you ready?
Hands up.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Boom.
Oh!
Right down the third base line.
Is he annoying you?
- Cos he was annoying me.
- No, no, no, no.
I got a brother the exact same age.
- Hey, are you Irish?
- Is it so obvious?
I'm just about to marry an Irish girl, so I guess I notice it more.
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.
Sometimes it seems as though there can't be anybody left at home.
Where's your girl from?
Enniscorthy in County Wexford.
My wife has family there.
Hey, Eilis.
Come here a sec.
Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Come on, come over here.
Come on.
Will we ever tell our children we did this?
Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.
I wonder what they'll think of it.
- Nancy.
- You look so glamorous.
I told you so.
I'm so sorry about Rose.
Thank you.
How are you?
No.
I knew, but I wanted to let Nancy tell you herself.
I'm so glad you can come to the wedding.
Can I?
Your mother accepted the invitation on your behalf.
- When is it?
- The 27th of August.
Will you come out with George and me tomorrow night?
Annette wants to see you, too.
Oh, I don't mind.
I'll have to find you a key.
I don't want you getting me out of bed.
We all want to hear what life in New York is like.
I'll try and think of something to say.
I'm booked to go back to New York on the 21st.
Well, you can wait an extra week to see your best friend married.
I can't believe I'm married to someone you'll never know.
But you'd like him.
I know you would.
He's sweet.
And he's funny.
And he's got these wonderful eyes that...
I wish everything were different.
So, now, Mrs O'Toole from Cush.
Do we really have to do this?
Getting a letter of condolence isn't like getting a birthday present, is it?
What if Mrs O'Toole from Cush writes back to thank you for your thank you?
Then I'll thank her.
And you'd be happy to spend the rest of your life like that?
It's not as if I've anything else to do or anybody else to talk to.
It might as well be Mrs O'Toole from Cush.
What do you want me to say?
- That'll be Nancy and Annette.
- Off you go.
Enjoy yourself.
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.
It's a great pleasure to meet you.
We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.
There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.
OK.
Do you have to be with other fellas from the rugby club all the time?
No.
But Nancy told us we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you cos you have too much to say to each other, so we're just looking for company.
Oh, well.
Do you not like the fellas from the rugby club, Eilis?
I don't particularly, George.
When I first went to America,
I missed every single thing about Enniscorthy except one.
We're not all the same.
You all look the same.
It's the blazer and the hair oil.
Nancy.
Where's Annette?
And why has he come?
He's very nice, so don't be too hard on him.
Is this the same Jim Farrell that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?
- What happened to her?
- He broke it off.
He didn't think she was serious about him.
He was very upset for a while, but he's over her now.
Nancy, I'm...
I'm going back.
But you can have a bit of fun while you're here, can't you?
Come on, George.
How's your mother?
She's...
Well, she's sad.
She's got much older very quickly.
It was a terrible thing.
We all went to the funeral Mass,
Mother and Father and myself.
I didn't know that.
My mother played golf with her, you know.
She was very fond of her.
It was...
It was the saddest thing to happen in the town that I can remember.
Thank you.
Come on, you two.
And what about the skyscrapers?
Ah, but that's Manhattan.
I live in Brooklyn and I work in Brooklyn, and if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.
All the skyscrapers are across the river.
You don't make it sound very glamorous.
It's not, really.
Not even, what do you call it, the department store where you work?
Oh, Bartocci's?
Well, it sells lovely things.
But I can't afford many of them and I don't like the work, so...
What would you like to do?
I want to do what Rose did.
I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.
Well, you should call in at Davis's.
They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.
I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.
But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.
I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.
You just want her to stay.
I'm only thinking of Eilis.
Do you hear that, Eilis?
He's only thinking of you.
That's it, that's it.
Remember, Mrs Grogan didn't notice a thing.
- Good night.
- Good night.
See you.
How was your evening?
It was very nice, thank you.
Was that Jim Farrell I saw in the car with them?
It was.
His parents are moving, you know.
They're retiring to the country.
He'll be in that big house on his own.
- Is that right?
- Hmm.
He's a catch for someone.
Good night, Mammy.
- Hello, Eilis.
- Hello, Mrs Brennan.
Quite the star.
- Thank goodness you're back.
- What's the matter?
A lad from Davis's came round.
They have a problem in their accounts department.
They need you up there straightaway.
Is that all?
I'll just put the shopping away.
No, no, leave it.
Straightaway, the young fella said.
It doesn't matter what he said, Mother.
I'm not an employee.
I'd be doing them a favour.
Please, let me do the shopping.
The problem is that it's our busy season, so all the mill workers and drivers did overtime last week.
Well, they filled out the overtime slips, but there's been nobody here to work it all out and to add to the wage slips, and some of the men have started to complain, and I can't blame them.
As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.
Well, if you leave me for a couple of hours,
I can work out a system so that whoever comes in after me won't have any trouble.
Hello, Eilis.
Maria has been telling me you've done the most marvellous job here.
Thank you.
We should have known you would, of course.
You're Rose's sister, after all.
I'm told you have a certificate in book-keeping.
Is it American book-keeping?
I got the certificate in America, but the two systems are very similar.
Well, we'll certainly need someone to deal with wages and so on during the busy season.
So I'd like you to continue on a part-time basis.
Let's see how that goes and then we'll speak again.
I'll be going back to the United States soon.
As I say, let's you and I speak again before we make any firm decisions one way or the other.
Yes, Mr Brown.
Of course.
Thank you.
Now, if you go and see Maria, she'll have your money for today.
I'd forgotten.
What?
This.
You have beaches in Brooklyn.
Yes, but they're just very crowded.
There'll probably be quite a few walkers along here later.
Yes.
It's still not the same.
I'm sure it's not.
We don't really know anything of the rest of the world.
We must seem very backward to you now.
Of course not.
You seem calm and civilised and charming.
Come on!
My mother wanted you to know that the golf club is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.
A special trophy for the best score by a lady newcomer at the club.
She was always very nice to the newcomers, my mother says.
I hope you're pleased.
Yes.
Of course.
So every year someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?
Yeah, every year, as long as there's a golf club.
And I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.
Yeah, and my mother would like to meet you too, by the way.
I'm supposed to arrange a time when you can come around for tea.
Thank you.
I'd like that.
I wish it had been like this before I went.
Before Rose died.
Like what?
There was nothing here for me before and now I have a job and...
Here?
Is that an American trick?
Yes.
It's a good one, isn't it?
It's depressing, though, that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?
I mean, how long have they known about it?
A hundred years, probably.
I don't think they had bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.
We still don't have them now.
Well, come on.
You wanna go see the Dodgers on Saturday?
- Sure.
- OK.
- Will you do something for me?
- What?
If you laugh or you say anything about this to anybody in the family, you don't get to go see the Dodgers on Saturday or any other day of the season.
Also you get a beating.
Maybe it's just better if I don't get involved.
I really need your help, Frankie.
You know you're the best writer and reader in the family?
- Yeah.
- I'm trying to write to Eilis.
And I want it to be...
I don't know.
You've wrote before already about five times.
Yeah, but they're no good, Frankie, and...
She's only written back once.
She's never read my writing before.
I'm worried I'm putting her off me.
Listen, I'm eight years old.
I don't know anything about kissing.
You don't need to know anything about kissing.
You need to know about spelling and...
And...
- Grammar.
- Yeah.
Will you look?
Dear Eilis.
I hope that you are doing well in Ireland.
I hope that your mother's feeling less sad.
It will not be long before your friend gets married and you can come home.
This week, it's like the whole world's basements are flooding.
I've fixed three.
I've been working hard.
I've been saving money.
Everybody asks me about you all the time.
You missed out an "E," I think.
It's "everybody."
Anyway, I think that is all my news.
Mom and Dad and all my brothers, they all say hello.
I think about you most minutes of most days.
Even when I go see the Dodgers,
I do not concentrate on the games.
With love, your Tony.
No hair oil.
And that's not a blazer.
It's a sports jacket.
Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?
Are you trying to trick me?
No.
I knew what you meant when you said we were all the same.
It made me think that my life must seem very easy to you.
I run my father's bar.
I'm going to live in my parents' house.
I know what that must look like from the outside, but...
It doesn't feel like that.
What does it feel like?
And I've never been anywhere.
I've never even been to England but I'd like to see London and Paris and Rome.
New York.
It frightens me, the idea of dying without ever leaving Ireland.
And there are other things too.
I'm so sorry, I wanted to ask you a thousand things and all I've done is talked.
I'm glad.
- Really?
- Yes.
Will you finish that wretched pipe and sit with us?
I can hear perfectly well from where I am.
We're not here to provide you with entertainment.
Oh, don't you worry.
I found that out many years ago.
Just ignore him, Eilis.
It's as well Jim takes after me, not him.
Speak up.
Are you looking forward to your move?
We'll miss Enniscorthy, but it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.
Mother's worried about leaving me here on me own.
She thinks I'll destroy the place.
Well, I'm hoping you won't be on your own forever.
I'm sure he won't.
I mean...
God, aren't we blessed with this weather?
It's lovely.
The summers in New York are hot, eh?
They can be, yes.
It can get quite humid sometimes.
Dear Tony.
Thank you for your letters.
I want you to know that...
I don't know what I want you to know.
I don't want to be sitting right at the back.
We'll make sure you get the best seats in the house.
But it wouldn't feel right sitting up there with Nancy and George.
We'll find the second best seats in the house, then.
Would you like me to run ahead and save you a couple of places, Mrs Lacey?
Would you mind, Jim?
That'd be grand.
- Such a gentleman, isn't he?
- He is.
Came along at just the right time for us.
I invite you now, Nancy, to declare before God and his Church your consent to become George's wife.
I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.
I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.
The rings.
Lord, bless these rings.
Grant that those who wear them may always be faithful to each other.
May they do your will and live in peace with you in mutual love.
We ask this through Christ our Lord, amen.
Amen.
Your mother tells me things are working out very well for you in Enniscorthy, Eilis.
It was a lovely service.
And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving out to Glenbrien,
- so Jim'll...
- Yes, I know.
Jim and I promised my mother we'd take her back to the car.
Mmm!
Do you hear that?
"Jim and I. Jim and I."
It won't be long now by the sound of it and your mother will have a wonderful day out.
Will you excuse me?
There they are.
- Hello, Mrs Byrne.
How are you?
- Jack.
Can we talk?
What about?
The future.
I can't let you just go back to America without saying anything.
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.
So...
I don't want you to go.
I want you to stay here with me.
And I know that means asking you another question but I don't want to bombard you.
So I'll save that one for later.
Thank you.
I'm grateful.
And I'm flattered.
- That's all?
- No.
No, of course not.
I just...
I'd imagined a different life for myself.
I understand.
But your life here could be just as good.
Better even maybe.
Mary.
- I was just coming to fetch you.
- To fetch me?
I haven't worked for Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary.
Please come, Eilis.
She told me not to come back without you.
You know what she's like.
You look after things for five minutes while I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.
There are no customers in there at the moment, so I don't think you can make too much of a mess of things.
So, how have you been getting on?
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.
I heard that you're working over in Davis's, in the accounts department.
That's right.
And there's lots of talk about you and young Jim Farrell.
Oh, well, you know what people are like.
They love to talk.
Yes.
Do you remember Mrs Brady?
She usually comes into the shop on Sunday morning for her rashers.
No?
Well, you have a very busy life now, what with one thing and another.
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece living in Brooklyn.
The world is a small place, isn't it?
She had a letter from her a couple of weeks back.
And what did it say?
Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding at the city hall and her husband bumped into a girl from Enniscorthy who was getting married there.
I'm not sure what you're telling me, Miss Kelly.
He didn't bump into me.
Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.
Although I'm not sure that that's your name any longer, is it?
He couldn't remember.
Something Italian, he thought.
I'd forgotten.
You'd forgotten?
What a thing...
I'd forgotten what this town is like.
What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?
Keep me away from Jim?
Stop me from going back to America?
Perhaps you didn't even know.
My name is Eilis Fiorello.
- Putting you through now.
- Thank you.
How can I help?
Hello.
I'd like to make a reservation for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.
I think people spend even more money after a wedding.
Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.
She was buying firelighters in Broom's.
Firelighters in August.
But she'd seen Mrs Stapleton in there and she hadn't had a chance to go through the whole day in detail with her...
Eilis, what's the matter?
Has something happened with Jim?
Mammy, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm married.
I got married in Brooklyn before I came home.
And I should have told you.
I should have told you as soon as I got back.
I want to be with him.
I want to be with my husband.
Of course.
Is he nice?
Yes.
He'd have to be nice if you married him.
So you're going back?
Yes.
Tomorrow.
Are you on the early train?
I'm going to bed.
Mammy, it's not even 8:00.
You don't have to.
I'm very tired.
And I'd like to say goodbye now.
And only once.
Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.
I will.
Good night, Eilis.
So are you away to live in America?
- No.
- Just visiting?
No, I live there already.
Really?
What's it like?
It's a big place.
I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York.
Do you know it?
Yes.
People say that there are so many Irish people there, it's like home.
Is that right?
Yes.
It's just like home.
You're not to eat.
But I might be there years.
No, you can eat when you get there.
Don't eat on the boat.
It'll stop you getting so sick.
Do you promise me?
I promise.
And in a moment I want you to go straight down to your cabin and lock the bathroom door on your side.
When next door starts hammering, you can negotiate.
When you get to immigration, keep your eyes wide open.
Look as if you know where you're going.
You have to think like an American.
You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.
But you will, and it won't kill you.
And one day the sun will come out.
You might not even notice straightaway, it'll be that faint.
And then you'll catch yourself thinking about something or someone who has no connection with the past,
someone who's only yours, and you'll realise... that this is where your life is.
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?
Not if what you're going to say will cause trouble for me in some way or another.
Nine o'clock mass is over, girls.
- Now.
One moment, please.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Brady, what would you like this morning?
Half a dozen rashers, please.
Of course.
Eilis will get that for you now.
- I was next.
- And you still are.
- Yes?
- I need some shoe polish.
Shoe polish?
That's not really a Sunday item now, is it?
These people need things for their dinner or their tea.
Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?
Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.
I'm sorry.
Miss.
Kelly...
I haven't forgotten.
Spit it out, whatever it is.
I'm away to America.
Whose idea was that?
Father Flood in New York arranged it.
Rose used to play golf with him.
He sponsored me.
He found me a job and got me a visa.
We won't be needing you back here.
I could work every Sunday until I go.
No, thank you.
- Your poor sister.
- My sister?
Mothers are always being left behind in this country.
But Rose...
That's the end for her now, isn't it?
She will be looking after your mother, for the rest of her life.
I wish I had written to Father Flood about you, Rose.
Me?
I have a job.
You had a couple of hours on a Sunday working for Nettles Kelly.
You should not call her that.
I think it's quite a kind name, considering she's actually a terrible old witch.
I don't want to talk about her any more.
Good.
They say it's hotter there in the summer, and colder in the winter.
What in Heaven's name will she do about clothes?
She'll buy them, mother.
She doesn't want to be wasting her money on clothes.
She won't have much choice.
She'll be there for...
- You look beautiful, Nancy.
- Thank you.
You look so beautiful it makes me despair of this place.
Why?
You're the prettiest girl in County Wexford.
You should be able to choose any man you want.
And we're hoping that George Sheridan from the rugby club looks your way.
- Do you think he might?
- Of course he will.
I know you like him, Nancy, but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?
And those boys with their hair oil and their blazers.
He has beautiful eyes.
And he's going to come into a beautiful shop in the Market Square.
Why didn't you wear your blue dress?
Are you asking why I didn't make more of an effort?
I suppose because I'm going away.
Come on.
He's looked over here twice already.
He hasn't!
He's walking over here now.
He's not!
Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridan's doing?
Would you like to dance?
Is that really everything you own?
Eilis, I should have looked after you better.
You've bought most of these clothes in this case.
That's one of the reasons I'm going, because I can't buy my own.
If it was just that, I'd spend every penny I had on you, gladly.
But I can't buy you a future.
I can't buy you the kind of life you need.
I know.
- You'll come see me there one day?
- Yes.
And you'll look after yourself?
You don't have to worry about me.
And I'll come home to visit, won't I?
Because I couldn't bear it if...
You haven't packed your shoes yet.
They'll take up a bit of room.
There.
I'm sorry.
Off!
Number one.
Bottom bunk.
That's mine.
You're on the top.
This is hell.
Never again.
Never again to America?
The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.
I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.
- Let's go for a smoke.
- I don't.
Suit yourself.
I'll see you later.
Unless I find a nice man in First to smoke with.
It's good to see that not everybody's put off their dinner by the weather forecast.
It's supposed to be a rough one tonight, so none of the other passengers are eating.
A few spoonfuls of soup, maybe, but not the mutton stew.
Please unlock it.
Go away, it is closed.
I'm sorry about the smell, and the bucket.
Don't worry.
The whole boat stinks.
Even First Class.
I've just been thrown out of there, by the way.
The bathroom door was locked all night.
Oh, those bastards.
There.
It won't be very comfortable.
But at least it's ours.
Open the door.
Fuck off!
Do you hear me?
Fuck off!
If you had been nice last night, we would have played fair.
Now you've got no toilet, you bastards.
Go on, you can use it.
I'm gonna get us some water.
That's all you're allowed.
You going to live in America?
You have papers and everything?
Yes.
And a job.
How did you manage to arrange all that?
I didn't.
Someone did it for me.
A priest my sister knows.
And how do you feel about it?
How long do the letters from Ireland take to arrive?
My sister Rose said she'd write straightaway.
They take a long time at first, and then no time at all.
You have family in America?
Friends?
No.
You'll meet people easy enough.
Where are you gonna live?
Brooklyn?
How do you know that?
Lucky guess.
Try to remember that sometimes it's nice to talk to people who don't know your auntie.
That's what it's like?
That's what it's like.
- I've been sick for hours.
- Nice, isn't it?
I am very hungry.
That's why you haven't been sick for hours.
We'll eat tomorrow.
Or the day after.
Oh, dear.
We'll have to do something with you.
They'll put you in quarantine or something if you try to enter the country looking like that.
Nothing fancy.
You mustn't look like a tart.
Well, looking like a tart isn't going to be a problem.
This doesn't look too bad.
My sister gave me that.
Wear it with... this.
And... this.
Open your bags ready for inspection.
Don't look too innocent, though.
I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.
Perhaps some eye-liner.
You step out of the line please.
Thank you.
Next, please.
Thank you.
Passport please.
Stand up straight.
Polish your shoes, and don't cough whatever you do.
Don't be rude, or pushy, and don't look too nervous.
This way!
Think like an American.
You have to know where you're going.
Welcome to the United States, ma'am.
Through the blue door, please.
Next, please.
Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen.
Amen.
I saw you had a letter today, Diana.
Any news?
Mr. de Valera has had another operation on his eyes, she says.
I don't want news that I can read in a newspaper.
Anyway, we would describe Mr. de Valera as "politics", would we not, Mrs. Kehoe?
And we do not like politics at the dinner table.
We don't.
It's not politics to talk about eye operations.
It is if the eyes belong to a politician.
And I do not like to talk about hospitals very much, either.
Patty, did you have any luck with that cold cream?
I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.
And I showed her the advertisement.
I don't want to have to travel all the way to Manhattan just for a jar of cold cream.
Maybe you could have a look at Bartocci's for me, Eilis?
Yes, Mrs. Kehoe.
Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.
She does not know for sure, Mrs. Kehoe.
She is only saying that Bartocci's is a better store than Webster's to get at Patty.
They are both very good, and you girls are very lucky to be working there.
Eilis, from the look of you, you have greasy skin, is that right?
What do you do about that?
Just...
Well, I wash it, Mrs. Kehoe, with soap.
There is nothing wrong with soap.
Soap was good enough for our Lord.
I expect.
Well, which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?
Does the Bible tell you that?
Our Lord was a man, anyway.
He didn't care about greasy skin.
Ladies.
No more talk about our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.
The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis, won't you, the girls?
- Hi.
- Good Morning.
Did you go out last night?
- Out.
The opposite of in.
- No.
I saw a movie with my boyfriend.
"What did you see, Dorothy?"
"I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis.
They filmed it in Ireland. "
"Oh, I'm from Ireland".
"I know you are, that's why I thought you might be interested. "
Thank you.
Shouldn't be a moment.
Is it still hot out there?
I haven't been outside since this morning but I can tell that it might be.
Very.
It just..
looks it.
It's warm, yes.
Thanks very much.
Remember...
If people like it here, they will come back.
So you treat every customer as if she's a new friend.
I will try.
It's not a matter of trying.
It's what you have to do.
Do you try to wear panties every day?
No.
I mean, I don't..
I don't try.
I just put them on.
You see what I'm saying?
- Yes.
- Good.
Can I get another sliced toast please?
Slice up some hot dog.
They want them sliced down the middle!
Sorry.
Could I have the bill please?
I hope that when I go through the pearly gates, the first sound I hear is you asking me for the check in that lovely Irish brogue.
Have they told you a date for the nylon sale yet, Eilis?
We've never had a Bartocci's girl living here.
We might get some inside information.
I haven't been told anything.
I'll bet you wouldn't let on if you had.
She's that sort.
More loyal to her bosses than to her friends.
Like a Red spy.
Oh, dear God.
I'll thank you to keep His name out of a conversation about nylons.
He might be everywhere, but he's certainly not in Bartocci's on sale day.
Sorry, Mrs. Kehoe.
I was glad to see you finally got some letters from home today, Eilis.
Did I?
I forgot to check.
They'll still be there after dinner.
Oh, sorry.
"Dear Eilis,
"it's hard for me to believe that you're reading this in America.
"Thousands of miles across the sea.
"The big news here is that since you left,
"Mummy has stopped shopping at Nettles Kelly's.
"As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh.
"And she overcharge for everything.
"And she's awful.
"I haven't told her to her face.
There's no need.
"She knows that she overcharges and her bread's not fresh.
"We talk about you every evening, of course.
"We want to know everything.
"I'm sure you're busy, but even if your letters were 200 pages,
"they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.
"Take care of yourself.
Love. "
Is it your time of the month?
So what is it?
Take some time off now.
Go and sit in the staff room.
I'm so sorry, Eilis.
This is all my fault.
I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.
Franco Bartocci says you are doing great here.
Ma Kehoe says you are the nicest lodger she's ever had.
- What?
- Ma Kehoe?
Don't ever call her that to her face.
I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.
I've enrolled you in a night class.
For book-keeping.
The Brooklyn College.
It will be three nights a week.
And I've paid your tuition for the first semester.
- Why?
- Why?
Not "Thank you"?
Sorry, thank you.
But why?
I was amazed that someone as clever as you couldn't find proper work at home.
I've been here too long.
I forget what it's like in Ireland.
So when your sister wrote to me about you,
I said that the Church would try to help.
Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.
I wish that I could stop feeling that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.
All I can say is that it will pass.
Homesickness is like most sicknesses.
It will make you feel wretched, and then move on to somebody else.
Now, Taylor versus Standard Gas Co is one of the most important corporate cases decided in the Supreme Court in the last 20 years.
This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock doctrine, so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.
In public utility integration proceedings alone literally thousands of investors may be affected by its application.
Did you understand any of that?
I mean, a single word?
He's not even reading from a book.
He just knows all this.
Let's hope the next hour is easier.
One of the things that ruins Christmas in America is the turkey.
It all tastes of sawdust.
So that's one cheese sandwich for Miss McAdam, and extra turkey for everyone else.
Ladies, please.
Eilis, Father Flood told me about your Christmas plans.
You're not serving lunch to the old fellas who've nowhere to go, are you?
He asks us every year.
We always say no.
Ellis, you're a saint.
They smell awful.
Sheila knows how they smell because that's where she goes husband-hunting.
It's a marvelous thing you're doing, Eilis.
A Christian thing.
I wish there were more like you.
You can come.
How many are we expecting?
There were a hundred last year.
There may be more this.
- They all Irish?
- All Irish.
Why don't they go home?
If there's nothing there for a clever young girl such as yourself, there's gonna be even less for men like these.
Some of them have been here 50 years, they have lost touch with everyone.
Happy Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.
These are the men who built... the tunnels, the bridges, the highways.
God alone knows what they live on now.
I don't want to interrupt the proceedings, but I'm sure you'd all like to show your appreciation to all the ladies here for their hard day's work.
And by way of a thank you, we have a great singer in the room with us today.
Frankie.
Would you like to come into the front room for a glass of something?
You've earned it.
- You survived!
- Oh it wasn't so bad.
- Happy Christmas!
- Cheers.
Now Miss McAdam is leaving us.
She is going to live with her sister in Manhattan.
She has the best room in the house.
The basement.
And it has its own entrance.
Now, I can only let a certain kind of girl stay there.
And I'm not talking about looks here.
Although I will admit that God did give Miss McAdam an advantage, when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.
No, you're a pretty girl, Eilis.
But you're sensible.
So, you're having the room and that's that.
Would the other girls not mind?
I expect so.
What don't they mind?
Girls, you'll take Dolores to dance with you
- on Saturday night, won't you?
- There's a dance?
At the parish hall.
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.
Patty and I aren't going this week.
We're going to see a movie instead.
I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.
I would, very much.
There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.
Yes, surprising, isn't it?
You'd think it'd be the other way around.
Of course, you'd be welcome to join us, Dolores.
So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.
You both miraculously found boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?
I hope you have more luck with these than you did with the last few.
- Will you be going, Eilis?
- Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
You can take Dolores, then.
Of course.
God, there's nobody here.
How are we supposed to get a fella if there's nobody here?
I expect most people will come after nine.
People?
Or fellas?
Some of the people will be fellas.
I'd love to meet a fella.
They came!
The liars!
What a pair of bitches.
That's what the old woman called them.
She said they were all bitches, apart from you.
Hello.
Hello.
It's good to see you.
I can see why.
Come with us.
There.
That's better.
Now you don't look like you came in from milking the cows.
Is that what I looked like?
Just a bit.
Nice clean cows.
1, 2, 3...
Not bad.
Maybe we could have a dance later?
- Sorry?
- A dance later.
Oh sure.
Would you like to dance?
Are you here with that guy?
The one who was teaching you to dance?
No.
So would you dance with me?
I'm not sure he taught me anything.
Doesn't matter.
The secret is to look as though you know what you're doing.
I wish someone had told me that years ago.
Come on.
- Where do you live?
- Clinton Street.
Yeah?
That's on my way home.
Can I walk you?
I'm going to say yes, and then I'm going to tell you why.
So I don't get the wrong idea?
I suppose so.
Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?
You don't know her?
I do.
She lives in my boarding house, and she's awful.
If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.
You'd be rescuing me.
I get it.
- I'm not Irish.
- You don't sound Irish.
I need to make this clear.
No part of me is Irish.
I don't have Irish parents or grandparents or anything.
I'm an Italian.
My parents are, anyway.
So what were you doing at an Irish dance?
Don't the Italians have dances?
Yeah.
And I wouldn't want to take you to one.
They behave like Italians all night.
What does that mean?
- Oh, you know.
- No.
- Hands.
- Too many of them?
Oh, my.
I guess it could seem that way, if it was a girl.
Listen...
I want everything out in the open.
I came to the Irish dance... because I really like Irish girls.
And I was the only one who would dance with you?
Oh, no, it wasn't...
So you danced with loads of others?
This is me.
Can I take you next week?
Maybe get something to eat first?
That'd be nice.
Good night.
There you go.
What do you do when you're not working?
There's school.
Just, you know...
Brooklyn College.
I'm studying book-keeping.
You want to be a book-keeper?
I want to be an accountant one day.
But, yes, book-keeping first.
Is that difficult?
I'm talking too much.
Tell me about plumbing.
You know enough about plumbing already.
I don't know anything.
You know that taps drip and toilets get blocked and that's all you need to know.
I don't know anything about book-keeping.
Well.
There's a lot to it.
There's all the maths, of course, but that's not so complicated.
The double entry system, that takes a while to get used to.
And we study company law, too, and that terrifies me.
So we had to read about an insurance company that went bankrupt in the 1930s, and all the the legal issues that went along with that...
She plays golf, and she's really good at it.
And if she'd been at the dance last Saturday, then...
I don't think you'd have looked at me twice, because Rose is beautiful.
I'm worried you haven't eaten anything.
Too busy talking.
What is the matter with you girls now?
Nothing is matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.
Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?
Eilis' young man?
We didn't know.
She won't say anything about it.
And why should she, to you awful gossip-mongers?
Anyway, I met him on Saturday night... when he called for Eilis, and he is a gentleman.
Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs Kehoe?
We know he's quite nice-looking.
I didn't like his shoes much.
What on earth is wrong with the shoes?
They were a funny color.
I'll tell you this much:
I am going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness.
I see now that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin.
A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man, and the noise she makes is a lot worse.
Now, enough.
Yeah.
Think about it.
You can...
Yeah, yeah.
All I want to do is travel home with you.
No food, no drink, no nothing.
I know you got to study and get some sleep.
I'll take you to your house and say goodnight.
Otherwise, it's too long to wait.
I want to ask you something.
You're gonna say, "Oh, it's too soon. "
"I don't really know him well enough, we've only been out a couple times. "
Oh, it's nothing so bad.
It is just something that most guys...
Please just ask.
You're beginning to terrify me.
Sure.
Will you come for dinner and meet my family sometime?
That's it?
I'd love to.
You like italian food?
Don't know.
I've never eaten it.
It is the best food in the world.
Well, why would not I like it?
You're in a good mood, huh?
Yes, why?
It's just...
I like how you're being.
I don't know the word.
When you go along with everything.
Amenable?
Yeah.
Amenable.
OK, so while you're being amenable..
Can we go see a movie this week when you're not in night classes?
I'll sign up for two movies.
- Really?
- Yes.
Even if the first date is a disaster,
I'll give it another chance.
It certainly feels like it, but this is my first year, so I don't know how to judge.
Congratulations.
You survived your first New York winter.
Ah, it wasn't so bad.
Really?
It's colder in Ireland?
Oh no, it's colder here.
Over here, that's how we judge the winter.
On how cold it is.
But you have heating everywhere.
You're only cold outside.
I guess that's true.
- Thank you for your help.
- Have a good day.
Eilis!
You're like a different person!
How did you do it?
Maybe I can pass some advice on to the next poor girl who feels that way.
I met somebody.
An Italian fella.
Oh no.
I'm not passing that on.
I'd rather have them homesick than heartbroken.
Does he talk about baseball all the time?
Or his mother?
- No.
- Then keep him.
There isn't another Italian man like him in New York.
Hold it.
Remember, you're getting off easy, because we haven't got sauce.
Yeah.
You have to remember that the sauce flies everywhere, so take it slowly.
I'm gonna say "splash" anytime I see problems.
- Good idea.
- Can I start now?
- Yeah!
- Go!
Splash!
You just splashed his mother, and his father, and the walls...
Let's go again.
Dear Rose, I suppose the most important news is that I have a boyfriend.
He isn't as important as Bartocci's... and my evening classes, I know that.
But I wanted to tell you everything that is going on.
Please don't mention it to Mummy though.
You know what's she like.
He's decent and kind, and he has a job, and he works hard.
We go to the cinema on Wednesdays and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.
I think of you and mother every single day.
But Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here.
I didn't have before I met him.
My body was here, but my life was back in Ireland with you.
Now it's halfway across the sea.
So that's something, isn't it?
- I'd better warned you about Frankie.
- He's the little one.
Yeah.
He's 8, going on 18.
He's nice and he's smart, but he's been talking and he's talking about all the things he's gonna to say to you.
- What sorts of things?
- We don't know.
Could be anything.
I mean, I swear I tried to pay him money to go out and play ball with his friends.
And my dad, he threatened him, but I think he's looking forward to causing trouble so much so he'll happily take a beating.
This is us here.
Ready?
How did you learn to eat spaghetti like that?
I've been taking lessons.
Lessons?
Like, in a class?
You can do that?
Maybe I could teach you.
No.
Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me... cooked me some spaghetti and made me try and eat it without making a mess.
So, what do you eat in Ireland?
Just Irish stew?
Not just.
We...
So first of all I should say that we don't like Irish people.
Hey, hey...
- Frankie!
- What?
We don't!
That is a well known fact!
Why Frankie?
Because a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up and he had to get stitches.
And because all the cops 'round here are Irish, nobody did anything about it.
There are probably two sides to it.
I might have said something I shouldn't, you know, I can't remember now.
No, because they beat you up.
Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.
No.
They just had red hair and big legs.
Raise up!
Excuse us.
All I can say in his defence is that he's the only one of us who'll get a college education.
If he can keep his mouth shut.
So, Tony tells me go to college.
Just night classes.
I want to be a book-keeper.
I like working in the shop well enough, but I don't want to be there forever.
Good.
I'm sorry, Eilis.
I'm an idiot.
I'm a rude idiot.
So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbett's Field when the season starts?
You like baseball?
He never mentioned the Dodgers?
Not even once?
Tony, what is the matter with you?
You know why?
Too much of this.
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbett's Field if you want to see him in the summer.
They're that important to you?
Put it this way.
If our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants,
- it'd break my heart.
- Mine too.
She's not laughing, Tony.
I think it's too late.
She's a Yanks fan.
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?
He's a Yanks fan.
I love you.
Thank you for the evening.
It was lovely.
Sorry!
I'd finished.
Sheila, can I ask you something?
Why are not you married?
Because my husband met somebody else and left me.
I'm sorry.
And...
Would you get married again?
- Has somebody asked you?
- No, not really.
I won't ask what that means.
Sheila?
Would I get married again?
No.
I want to be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding-house forever.
Of course, I do.
That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.
I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom.
While some bad-tempered fella, with hair growing out of his ears reads the newspaper on the toilet.
And then I'll wish I was back here, talking to you.
I'll catch you tomorrow right?
Eilis!
I'm sorry!
I did not think you were coming.
I know.
I thought you were gonna think that.
That's why I wanted to be here.
No matter what.
I need to say something...
Can you...
Can we talk about something else... until we get to Ms. Kehoe?
- It's not...
- Please?
So.
Ten minutes before I'm supposed meet you... and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.
Yes.
Even if you were thinking of inviting me in for a coffee.
I would have to say no, for your sake.
So how did you fix it in ten minutes?
I didn't.
I spent the whole 10 minutes explaining to the old lady that I had to be somewhere and I'd be back.
She didn't want to let me go.
So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?
What's the difference between six inches of sewage and a foot?
Let me say what I want to say.
I don't think you'll mind.
Okay.
You remember that after I had dinner at your house, you told me you loved me.
I didn't really know what to say.
But I know what to say now.
I have thought about you.
And I like you, and I like being with you and...
Maybe, I feel the same way.
So the next time you tell me you love me, if there is a next time...
I'll say I love you too.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Holy shit!
Excuse my language, but...
I thought we were having a different kind of talk.
Can I go home now?
- You love me?
- Yes.
But don't ask me anything else, and don't talk about our kids being Dodgers fans.
You want kids who like the Yankees?
Tony, please don't push me.
All right.
I'm sorry.
"Dear Eilis,
"Thank you so much for the nylons.
"The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.
"It seems everything is so exciting and new compared to here.
"I can't wait for you to show it all to me one day.
"Eilis, you know I'm by your side, even when I'm not. "
You're marvelous, that's all I have to say.
And it looks to me as if you didn't just pass those exams.
You, you flew through them.
I can't remember the last time anyone came here with good news.
I've saved some money.
I'll be able to pay for next year's tuition and pay you back for last year.
One of my parishioners paid.
He needed to do something for mankind, and I won't tell you why.
He is not out of the woods yet, either.
so he can cough up for next year, too.
I'd love to know what sort of woods he's in.
Yes, I'm sure you would, but you won't hear it from me.
Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.
You're not the miserable young girl who wanted to go home last winter.
Seems like years ago.
Now, I think this is the first time... any girl of mine has ever passed an exam, while living here.
Have you told Tony yet, Eilis?
Of course.
And is he taking you out to celebrate?
We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.
- Oh, boy!
- What does that mean?
Do you have a bathing costume?
- No, I was going to get one...
- Do you have sunglasses?
- No.
- You need sunglasses.
I read that if you don't have them on the beach this year people will talk about you.
And what exactly will they say, Sheila?
That's the thing, Mrs. Kehoe.
You'd never know, because they'd never say it to your face.
Oh, dear God!
Diana's right, though, Eilis.
You need to think carefully about your costume.
It's the most Tony will ever have seen of you.
You don't want to put him off.
You'll have to shave down there.
I'll give you a razor that will do the trick.
You're all right there for the moment.
And most Italian men appreciate the fuller figure.
But watch yourself, over the summer.
The black's too dark for your pale skin.
Let's see you in the green.
Look at that thing.
Why didn't you tell me to put my costume on underneath my clothes?
I thought you'd know.
Right, I'm ready.
- Tony!
- What?
Come on.
"Dear Rose, thanks for your letter.
"I was happy to hear about your golf tournament.
"You must have been really pleased.
"I still miss you and mother,
"and I think about you every day.
"But I think I can say that for the first time
"since I've been in America,
"I'm really happy.
"This is a lot to do with Tony.
"At the weekend he took me to see the Brooklyn Dodgers,
"the baseball team he loves.
"They lost, so he was annoyed.
"But I've also started to look for office work, too.
"I had an interview this week...
"at a textile firm here in Brooklyn. "
Rose?
"Who'd have thought
"that there would be two book-keepers in the family?"
Rose?
"I'll soon be able to afford to come home and see you and mummy. "
Rose!
Rose?
Oh my God!
Oh God!
Rose?
Oh no!
A moment.
It was sudden.
I think perhaps she was ill, and she knew she was ill, and she didn't tell anybody.
What will happen?
What can happen?
- When will they bury her?
- Tomorrow.
- Without me.
- Without you.
You're too far away, Eilis.
Why did I ever come here?
Rose wanted a better life for you.
She loved how well you were doing.
But I will never see her again.
That's right, isn't it, Father?
I will never see her again.
You know that I think you will.
And she will be watching over you, every day, for the rest of your life.
Hello?
Mommy?
Can you hear me now?
Hello?
I can't really hear you.
Well, the rain held off, anyway.
And the whole of her golf club came.
Every single one of them.
We had a real houseful afterwards.
Are you still there?
Yes.
People really loved her, Eilis.
Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.
Nobody knew what to say to me.
When your daddy died,
I said to myself that I shouldn't grieve too much because I had the two of you.
Then when you went to America, I told myself the same thing because she was here with me.
But everyone's gone, Eilis.
I have nobody.
I can't bear it, Tony.
You wanna go home, I guess.
And how would it be for you, if I did go home?
I'll be afraid, every single day.
- Afraid that I wouldn't come back?
- Yeah.
Home is home.
I'm not sure if I have a home anymore.
You are not going to work tomorrow, are you?
After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?
This is it.
We're gonna build five houses here, if we can.
And mom and dad, they are gonna have one, 'cause ma' always wanted a house with a backyard.
We'll sell three.
And the other one...
My brothers they asked me if I wanted it and I said that I did.
So, I guess what I'm saying is if you want to live out here on Long Island?
I know it doesn't look like much right now, but all the land around here has been sold, so we wouldn't be on our own.
And there would be telephone cables, electricity and everything.
We're gonna set up a company, a building company, the three of us.
And I'm gonna do the plumbing and Lawrence is gonna do the carpentry.
Don't go all quiet on me.
At least tell me you'll think about it.
I don't need to think about it.
It's just for a month or so.
I know it would make her feel a little better.
Will you marry me before you leave?
You don't trust me to come back?
Marry me!
Marry me!
We don't have to tell anyone.
We just do it quickly, just keep it between us.
Why do you want to do it?
Because if we don't, I am gonna go crazy.
Would a promise not be the same?
If you can promise, you can easily do this.
So this is it?
This is where you live?
Yes, and if you make one tiny noise she'll evict me.
Oh, man!
Oh, man!
There's no point in worrying now.
Stay with me.
- Do you want to play?
- Yes, sure.
Alright.
Here we go, one bat coming up.
I'll take that, alright.
You ready?
Hands up.
Oh, right down to the third-base line.
Is he annoying you?
Because he is annoying me.
No.
I got a brother the exact same age?
Hey, are you Irish?
Is it so obvious?
I'm just about to marry an Irish girl, so I guess I notice it more.
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.
Sometimes it seems as though there can't be anybody left at home.
Where is your girl from?
Enniscorthy, in County Wexford.
I think my wife has family there.
Hey, Eilis!
Come here for a second.
Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.
Will we ever tell our children we did this?
Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.
I wonder what they'll think of it.
Nancy!
You look so glamorous!
I told you so.
- I'm so sorry about Rose.
- Thank you.
How are you?
No!
I knew.
But I wanted to let Nancy tell you herself.
I am so glad you can come to the wedding.
Can I?
Your mother accepted the invitation on your behalf.
- When is it?
- The 27th of August.
Will you come out with George and me tomorrow night?
Annette wants to see you, too.
I don't mind.
I'll have to find you a key.
I don't want you getting me out of bed.
We all want to hear what life in New York is like.
I'll try and think of something to say.
I'm booked to go back to New York on twenty-first.
You can wait an extra week to see your best friend married.
I can't believe I'm married to someone you'll never know.
But you'd like him.
I know you would.
He's sweet.
He's funny.
And he has got these wonderful eyes that...
I wish everything were different.
So, now.
Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.
Do we really have to do this?
Getting a letter of condolence isn't like getting a birthday present, is it?
What if Mrs. O'Toole from Cush writes back to thank you for your thank you?
Then I'll thank her.
And you'll be happy to spend the rest of your life like that?
It's not as if I have anything else to do.
Nor anybody else to talk to.
It might as well be Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.
What do you want me to say?
That would be Nancy and Annette.
Off you go.
Enjoy yourself.
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.
It's a great pleasure to meet you.
We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.
There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.
Okay.
Do you have to be with other fellas from the rugby club all the time?
No.
But Nancy told us that we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you.
Because you have too much to say to each other.
So we're just looking for company.
Oh, well.
Do you not like the fellas from the rugby club, Eilis?
I don't particularly, George.
When I first went to America,
I missed everything about Enniscorthy, except one.
We are not all the same.
You all look the same.
It's the blazer and the hair oil.
Nancy, where is Annette?
And why has he come?
He's very nice, so don't be too hard on him.
Is this the same Jim Farrell that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?
What happened to her?
He broke it off.
He didn't think she was serious about him.
He was very upset for a while, but he's over her now.
Nancy, I'm going back.
But you can have a bit of fun while you're here, can't you?
Come on, George.
How is your mother?
She's sad, and she's got much older very quickly.
It was a terrible thing.
We all went to the funeral mass.
My mother and my father and myself.
I did not know that.
My mother played golf with her, you know.
She is very fond of her.
It was the saddest thing that happened in the town that I can remember.
- Thank you.
- Come on, you two.
- What about the skyscrapers?
- But that is Manhattan.
I live and I work in Brooklyn.
And if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.
All the skyscrapers are across the river.
- You don't make it sound glamorous.
- It's not, really.
Not even... what do you call it?
The department store where you work?
Bartocci's?
It sells lovely things, but I can't afford many of them...
- And I don't like the work so...
- What would you like to do?
I want to do what Rose did.
I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.
You should call in at Davis's.
They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.
I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.
But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.
I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.
You just want her to stay.
I am only thinking of Eilis.
Did you hear that, Eilis?
He's only thinking of you.
That's it, that's it...
- Good night.
- Good night.
- See you.
- See you.
Bye.
- How's your evening?
- It's very nice, thank you.
Was that Jim Farrell I saw on the car with them?
It was.
His parents are moving, you know.
They're retiring to the country.
He'll be in that big house on his own.
Is that right?
It's a catch for "someone".
Goodnight Mommy.
- Hello, Eilis.
- Hello, Ms. Brennan.
I like her style.
- Thank Goodness you're back!
- What's the matter?
A lad from Davis's came round.
They have a problem in their accounts department
- And they need you straight away.
- Is that all?
- I'll just put the shopping away.
- No, leave it.
"Straight away", the young fella said.
It doesn't matter what he said, Mother.
I'm not an employee.
I'd be doing them a favour.
Please let me do the shopping.
The problem is that it's our busy season, so all the middle workers and drivers did overtime last week.
They filled out the overtime slips but there's been nobody to work it all out, to add to the wage slips.
And some of the men have started to complain.
And I can't blame them.
As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.
If you leave me for a couple of hours, I can work out a system so that whoever comes in after me won't have any trouble.
Hello, Eilis.
Maria has been telling me you have done the most marvellous job here.
Thank you.
We should have known you would.
You're Rose's sister, after all.
I'm told you have a certificate in book-keeping?
Is it in American book-keeping?
I got the certificate in America, but the two systems are very similar.
We'll certainly need someone to deal with wages and so on during the busy season.
So I'd like you to continue on a part-time basis.
Let's see how that goes and then we'll speak again.
I'll be going back to the United States soon.
As I said.
Let's you and I speak again before we make any firm decisions one way or the other.
Yes, Mr. Brown.
Of course.
Thank you.
Now, if you go and see Maria, she'll have your money for today.
- I'd forgotten.
- What?
This.
You have beaches in Brooklyn?
Yes, but they are just very crowded.
There will probably be quite a few walkers along here later.
Yes.
It's still not the same.
I'm sure it's not.
We don't really know anything of the rest of the world.
We must seem very backward to you now.
Of course not.
You seem calm, and civilised.
And charming.
Come on!
My mother wanted you to know that the golf club is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.
A special trophy for the best score by a lady newcomer at the Club.
She was always nice to the newcomers, my mother says.
I hope you're pleased.
Yes, of course.
So, every year, someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?
Every year.
As long as there's a golf club.
I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.
Yeah and my mother would like to meet you too, by the way.
I'm supposed to arrange a time when you can come around for tea.
Thank you, I'd like that.
I wish it had been like this before I went.
- Before Rose died.
- Like what?
There was nothing here for me here before.
- And now I have a job.
- Here?
- Is that an American trick?
- Yes.
It's a good one, isn't it?
It's depressing, though, that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?
I mean, how long have they known about it?
A hundred years, probably.
I don't think they had bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.
And we still don't have them now.
Come on.
You want to go see the Dodgers on Saturday?
Sure.
Okay, will you do something for me?
What?
If you laugh, or you say anything about this to anybody in the family, you don't get to go see the Dodgers on Saturday.
Or any other day of the season.
Also, you get a beating.
Maybe it's just better if I don't get involved.
I really need your help Frankie.
You know you're the best writer and reader in the family?
I'm trying to write to Eilis, and I want it to be, I don't know...
You wrote before already.
About five times.
Yeah, but they are no good Frankie.
And she's only written back once.
She's never read my writing before.
I'm worried I'm putting her off me.
Listen, I'm eight years old, I don't know anything about kissing.
You don't need to know anything about kissing.
You need to know about spelling and...
- Grammar?
- Yeah.
Will you look?
"Dear Eilis, I hope that you're doing well in Ireland.
"I hope that your mother is feeling less sad.
"It will not be long before your friend gets married and you can come home.
"This week is like the whole world's basements are flooding.
"I fixed three.
I've been working hard.
I've been saving money.
"Everybody asks me about you all the time. "
You missed out the "e" I think.
It is "everybody".
"Anyway, I think that is all my news.
"Mom and dad and all my brothers, they all say hello.
"I think about you most minutes of most days.
"Even when I go see the Dodgers.
"I do not concentrate on the game.
"With love, your Tony. "
No hair oil.
And that's not a blazer, it's a sports jacket.
Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?
Are you trying to trick me?
I knew what you meant, when you said we're all the same.
It made me think that my life must seem very east to you.
I run my father's bar, going to live in my parents' house.
I know what that must look like from the outside but it doesn't feel like that.
What does it feel like?
I've never been anywhere.
I have never even been to England.
But I'd like to see London, and Paris and Rome.
New York.
It frightens me, the idea of dying without ever leaving Ireland.
And there are other things too...
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to ask you a thousand things
- and all I've done is talked.
- I am glad.
- Really?
- Yes.
Will you finsh that wretched pipe and sit with us?
I can hear perfectly well from where I am.
We are not here to provide you with entertainment.
Oh, don't you worry.
I found that out many years ago.
Just ignore him, Eilis.
It's as well Jim takes after me but him.
Speak up!
Are you looking forward to your move?
I will miss Enniscorthy.
But it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.
My mother's worried about leaving me here on me own.
She thinks I'll destroy the place.
I'm hoping you won't be on your own forever.
I'm sure he won't.
I mean...
- Aren't we blessed with this weather.
- It's lovely.
"Dear Tony, thank you for your letters.
"I want you to know that...
I don't know what I want you to know.
I don't want to be sitting right at the back.
I'll make sure you get the best seats in the house.
It wouldn't feel right sitting up there with Nancy and George.
We'll find the second best seats in the house then.
Would you like me to run ahead and save you a couple of places, Mrs. Lacey?
Would you mind, Jim?
That would be grand.
- Such a gentleman, isn't he?
- He is.
He came along at the right time for us.
I invite you now Nancy to declare before God and his church... your consent to become George's wife.
I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.
I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.
The rings.
Lord, bless these rings, grant that those who wear them may always be faithful to each other.
May they do your will and live in peace with you, and mutual love.
We ask this through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Amen.
Your mother tells me things are working out for you very well in Enniscorthy, Eilis.
It was a lovely service.
And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving out to Glenbrien, so Jim will...
Yes, I know.
Jim and I promised my mother we'd take her back to the car.
Do you hear that?
Jim and I!
Jim and I!
It won't be long now, by the sound of it, and your mother will have a wonderful day out.
Will you excuse me?
Can we talk?
- What about?
- The future.
I can't let you just go back to America without saying anything.
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.
So, I don't want you to go.
I want you to stay here, with me.
And I know that means asking you another question, but I don't want to bombard you.
So I'll save that one for later.
Thank you.
I'm grateful.
And I'm flattered.
- That's all?
- No.
No, of course not.
It is just...
I'd imagined a different life for myself.
I understand.
But your life here could be just as good.
Better, even, maybe.
Mary!
I was just coming to fetch you.
To fetch me?
I haven't worked for Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary.
Oh, Please come Eilis.
She told me not to come back without you.
You know what she's like.
You look after things for five minutes while I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.
There are no customers in there at the moment, so I don't think you can make too much of a mess of things.
So.
How have you been getting on?
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.
I heard that you're working over at Davis's?
In the accounts department?
That's right.
And there's lots of talk about you and young Jim Farrell.
You know what people are like.
They love to talk.
Yes.
Do you remember Mrs. Brady?
She usually comes into the shop on Sunday morning for her rashers.
No?
You have a very busy life now.
What with one thing and another.
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece living in Brooklyn.
The world is a small place, isn't it?
She had a letter from her a couple of weeks back.
And what did it say?
Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding at the city hall, and her husband bumped into a girl from Enniscorthy who was getting married there.
I'm not sure what you're telling me, Miss Kelly.
He didn't bump into me.
Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.
Although I'm not sure that that's your name any longer, is it?
He couldn't remember.
Something Italian, he thought.
I'd forgotten.
You'd forgotten!
What a thing for...
I'd forgotten what this town is like.
What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?
Keep me away from Jim?
Stop me from going back to America?
Perhaps you didn't even know.
My name is Eilis Fiorello.
- Thank you.
- How I can help you?
Hello, I'd like to make a reservation for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.
I think people spend even more money after a wedding.
Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.
She was buying firelighters in Broom's.
Firelighters!
In August!
But she'd seen Mrs. Stapleton in there, and she hadn't had a chance to go through the whole day in detail with her, so...
Eilis, what's the matter?
Has something happened with Jim?
Mommy, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm married.
I got married in Brooklyn before I came home.
I should have told you.
I should have told you as soon as I got back.
I want to be with him.
I want to be with my husband.
Of course.
Is he nice?
Yes.
He'd have to be nice, if you married him.
So you are going back?
Yes.
Tomorrow.
Are you on the early train?
I'm going to bed.
Mummy...
It's not even eight o'clock.
You don't have to..
I'm very tired.
And I'd like to say goodbye now, and only once.
Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.
I will.
Goodnight, Eilis.
So are you away to live in America?
- No.
- Just visiting?
No.
I live there already.
Really?
What's it like?
It's a big place.
I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York.
Do you know it?
Yes.
People say that there's so many Irish people there.
It's like home.
Is that right?
Yes, it's just like home.
You're not to eat.
But I might be there years.
No, you can eat when you get there.
Don't eat on the boat.
It'll stop you getting so sick.
Do you promise me?
I promise.
And in a moment, I want you to go straight down to your cabin and lock the bathroom door on your side.
When next door starts hammering, you can negotiate.
When you get to Immigration, keep your eyes wide open,
Look as if you know where you're going.
You have to think like an American.
Could you please step forward?
You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die, and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.
But you will, and it won't kill you.
And one day the sun will come out.
You might not even note it straight away, it would be that faint.
And then you will catch yourself thinking about something, or someone who has no connection with the past,
Someone who's only yours.
And you'll realise that this is where your life is.
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?
Not if what you're going to say will cause trouble for me in some way or another.
9:00 mass is over, girls.
- Now.
- Thank you.
- One moment, please.
- Excuse me.
And some rashers and some cheese.
Mrs Brady, what would you like this morning?
- Half a dozen rashers, please.
- Of course.
Eilis will get that for you now.
- I was next.
- And you still are.
- Yes?
- I need some shoe polish.
Shoe polish?
That's not really a Sunday item, now, is it?
These people need things for their dinner or their tea.
Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?
Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.
I'm sorry.
Miss Kelly...
I hadn't forgotten.
Spit it out, whatever it is.
I'm away to America.
Whose idea was that?
Father Flood in New York arranged it.
Rose used to play golf with him.
He sponsored me.
And he found me a job and got me a visa.
Well, we won't be needing you back here.
I could work every Sunday till I go.
No, thank you.
- Your poor sister.
- My sister?
Well, mothers are always being left behind in this country.
But Rose, that's the end for her now, isn't it?
She'll be looking after your mother for the rest of her life.
I wish I'd written to Father Flood about you, Rose.
Me?
I have a job.
You had a couple of hours on a Sunday working for Nettles Kelly.
You shouldn't call her that.
I think it's quite a kind name.
Considering she's actually a terrible old witch.
Well, I don't want to talk about her any more.
Good.
They say it's hotter there in the summer and colder in the winter.
What in heaven's name will she do about clothes?
She'll buy them, Mother.
She doesn't want to be wasting her money on clothes.
She won't have much choice.
She'll be there for...
- You look beautiful, Nancy.
- Thank you.
You look so beautiful.
It makes me despair of this place.
Why?
Well, you're the prettiest girl in County Wexford.
You should be able to choose any man you want and we're hoping that George Sheridan from the rugby club looks your way.
Do you think he might?
Of course he will.
I know you like him, Nancy, but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?
And those boys with their hair oil and their blazers.
- He has beautiful eyes.
- Mmm...
And he's going to come into a beautiful shop in the market square.
Why didn't you wear your blue dress?
Are you asking why I didn't make more of an effort?
I suppose cos I'm going away.
Mind, now.
Come on.
He's looked over here twice already.
He hasn't!
- He's walking over here now.
- He's not!
Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridan's doing?
Would you like to dance?
Is that really everything you own?
Oh, Eilis.
I should have looked after you better.
You've bought most of the clothes in this case.
That's one of the reasons I'm going, cos I can't buy my own.
If it was just that, I'd spend every penny I had on you.
Gladly.
But I can't buy you a future.
I can't buy you the kind of life you need.
I know.
But you'll come see me there one day?
Yes.
And you'll look after yourself?
You don't have to worry about me.
And I'll come home to visit, won't I?
Cos I couldn't bear it if...
You haven't packed your shoes yet.
They'll take up a bit of room.
There.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Off.
Number one, bottom bunk, that's mine.
You're on the top.
This is hell.
- Never again.
- Never again to America?
The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.
I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.
Let's go for a smoke.
I don't.
Suit yourself.
I'll see you later.
Unless I find a nice man in First to smoke with.
It's good to see that not everybody's put off their dinner by the weather forecast.
It's supposed to be a rough one tonight, so none of the other passengers are eating.
A few spoonfuls of soup maybe, but not the mutton stew.
Please unlock it.
Go away!
I'm sorry about the smell.
And the bucket.
Don't worry.
The whole boat stinks.
Even First Class.
I've just been thrown out of there, by the way.
The bathroom door was locked all night.
Oh, those bastards.
There.
Won't be very comfortable, but at least it's ours.
- Open the door.
- Feck off.
- Open the door right now.
- Do you hear me?
Fuck off.
If you'd been nice last night, we would have played fair.
- Now you've got no toilet.
- Get out of the bathroom.
You bastards.
Go on, you can use it.
I'm going to get us some water.
That's all you're allowed.
Are you going to live in America?
Yes.
You have papers and everything?
Yes.
And a job.
How'd you manage to arrange all that?
I didn't.
Someone did it for me.
A priest my sister knows.
And how do you feel about it?
How long do letters from Ireland take to arrive?
My sister Rose said she'd write straightaway.
They take a long time at first.
And then no time at all.
You have family in America?
Friends?
No.
You'll meet people easily enough.
Where are you gonna live?
Brooklyn?
- How'd you know that?
- Lucky guess.
Try to remember that sometimes it's nice to talk to people who don't know your auntie.
That's what it's like?
That's what it's like.
I haven't been sick for hours.
Nice, isn't it?
I'm very hungry.
That's why you haven't been sick for hours.
We'll eat tomorrow.
Or the day after.
Oh, dear.
We're gonna have to do something with you.
They'll put you in quarantine or something if you try and enter the country looking like that.
Nothing fancy.
You mustn't look like a tart.
Oh, well, looking like a tart isn't going to be a problem.
This doesn't look too bad.
My sister gave me that.
Wear it with this and this.
Have your bags ready for inspection.
Don't look too innocent, though.
I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.
Perhaps a little eye liner.
Step out of the line, please.
Thank you.
Next, please.
Thank you.
Step over this way, please.
Get out of the line.
Next.
Passport, please.
Stand up straight.
Polish your shoes.
And don't cough, whatever you do.
Over this way.
Don't be rude or pushy, but don't look too nervous.
Step this way.
Think like an American.
You have to know where you're going.
Welcome to the United States, ma'am.
Through the blue door, please.
Next, please.
Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, amen.
Amen.
I saw you had a letter today, Diana.
Any news?
Mr de Valera's had another operation on his eyes, she says.
He's been in Holland.
I don't want news I can read in a newspaper.
Anyway, we would describe Mr de Valera as politics, would we not, Mrs Kehoe?
And we do not like politics at the dinner table.
We don't.
It's not politics to talk about eye operations.
It is if the eyes belong to a politician.
And I don't like to talk about hospitals very much either.
Patty, did you have any luck with that cold cream?
No, Mrs Kehoe.
I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.
And I showed her the advertisement.
I don't want to have to travel all the way into Manhattan just for a jar of cold cream.
Maybe you could have a look in Bartocci's for me, Eilis?
Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.
She doesn't know that for sure, Mrs Kehoe.
She's only saying that Bartocci's is a better store than Webster's to get at Patty.
They're both very good and you girls are very lucky to be working there.
Eilis, from the look of you, you have greasy skin.
Is that right?
What do you do about that?
Just...
Well, I wash it, Mrs Kehoe, with soap.
There's nothing wrong with soap.
Soap was good enough for Our Lord, I expect.
Oh, and which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?
Does the Bible tell you that?
Our Lord was a man, anyway.
He didn't care about greasy skin.
Ladies, no more talk about
Our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.
The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis.
- Won't you, girls?
- Mmm-hmm.
Hi.
- Good morning.
- Did you go out last night?
- Out, the opposite of in.
- No.
Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.
"What did you see, Dorothy?"
"I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis.
They filmed it in Ireland."
"Oh, I'm from Ireland."
"I know you are.
That's why I thought you might be interested."
Thank you.
Shouldn't be a moment.
Is it still hot out there?
I haven't been outside since this morning.
But I can tell that it might be very.
It just looks it.
It's warm, yes.
Thanks very much.
Remember, if people like it here, they'll come back, so you treat every customer as if she's a new friend.
- I'll try.
- It's not a matter of trying.
It's what you have to do.
Do you try to wear panties every day?
No.
I mean, I don't...
I don't try.
I just put them on.
You see what I'm saying?
Yes.
Good.
Can we get another side of toast, please?
Slice up some hot dogs.
They want 'em sliced down the middle.
Sorry.
Could I have the bill, please?
I hope that when I go through the Pearly Gates, the first sound I hear is you asking me for the cheque in that lovely Irish brogue.
Diana?
Have they told you a date for the nylon sale yet, Eilis?
Never had a Bartocci's girl living here.
Might get some inside information.
I haven't been told anything.
- I bet you wouldn't let on if you had.
- She's that sort.
More loyal to her bosses than to her friends.
- Like a Red spy.
- Oh, dear God.
I'll thank you to keep His name out of a conversation about nylons.
He might be everywhere, but he's certainly not in Bartocci's on sale day.
Sorry, Mrs Kehoe.
I was glad to see you finally got some letters from home today, Eilis.
Did I?
I forgot to check.
They'll still be there after dinner.
Sorry.
Dear Eilis.
It's hard for me to believe that you're reading this in America, thousands of miles across the sea.
The big news here is that since you left,
Mammy has stopped shopping at Nettles Kelly's.
As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh and she overcharged for everything...
And she's awful.
I haven't told her to her face.
There's no need.
She knows that she overcharges and her bread's not fresh.
We talk about you every evening, of course.
We want to know everything.
I'm sure you're busy, but even if your letters were 200 pages, they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.
Take care of yourself.
Love.
Is it your time of the month?
So what is it?
Take some time off now.
Go and sit in the staff room.
I'm so sorry, Eilis.
This is all my fault.
I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.
Franco Bartocci says you're doing great here.
Ma Kehoe says you're the nicest lodger she's ever had.
- What?
- "Ma Kehoe"?
Don't ever call her that to her face.
I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.
I've enrolled you in a night class, for book-keeping.
Brooklyn College.
It'll be three nights a week and I've paid your tuition for the first semester.
- Why?
- Why?
Not thank you?
Sorry.
Thank you.
But why?
Well, I was amazed that someone as clever as you couldn't find proper work at home.
I've been here too long.
I forget what it's like in Ireland.
So when your sister wrote to me about you,
I said the Church would try to help.
Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.
I wish that I could stop feeling that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.
All I can say is that it will pass.
Homesickness is like most sicknesses.
It'll make you feel wretched and then it'll move on to somebody else.
Now, Taylor v. Standard Gas Company is one of the most important corporate cases decided in the Supreme Court in the last 20 years.
This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock Doctrine, so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.
In public utility integration proceedings alone, literally thousands of investors may be affected by its application.
Did you understand any of that?
I mean, a single word?
He's not even reading from a book.
He just knows all this.
Well, let's hope the next hour's easier, huh?
One of the things that ruins Christmas in America is the turkey.
It all tastes of sawdust.
So that's one cheese sandwich for Miss McAdam and extra turkey for everyone else.
Ladies, please.
Eilis, Father Flood told me about your Christmas plans.
Oh, you're not serving lunch to the old fellas who've nowhere to go, are you?
He asks us every year.
We always say no.
Eilis, you're a saint.
They smell awful.
Sheila knows how they smell because that's where she goes husband hunting.
It's a marvellous thing you're doing, Eilis.
A Christian thing.
I wish there were more like you.
In you come.
How many are we expecting?
We had a hundred last year.
There may be more this.
- Are they all Irish?
- All Irish.
Why don't they go home?
If there's nothing there for clever young girls such as yourself, there's gonna be even less for men like these.
Some of them have been here 50 years.
They've lost touch with everyone.
Lovely.
Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.
These are the men who built the tunnels, the bridges, the highways.
God alone knows what they live on now.
Anyway...
I don't want to interrupt proceedings, but I'm sure you'd all like to show your appreciation to all the ladies here for their hard day's work.
And by way of a thank you, we have a great singer in the room with us today.
Frankie.
Mind yourself, there.
Would you like to come into the front room for a glass of something?
You've earned it.
You survived.
Ah...
It wasn't so bad.
- Happy Christmas.
- Cheers.
Now, Miss McAdam is leaving us.
She's going to live with her sister in Manhattan.
She has the best room in the house, the basement, and it has its own entrance.
Now, I can only let a certain kind of girl stay there.
Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.
Although I will admit, God did give Miss McAdam an advantage when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.
No, no, you're a pretty girl, Eilis, but you're sensible.
So, you're having the room and that's that.
Will the other girls not mind?
Oh, I expect so.
What don't they mind?
Girls, you'll take Dolores to the dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?
There's a dance?
At the parish hall.
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.
Um...
Patty and I aren't going this week.
We're going to see a movie instead.
Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.
I would, very much.
There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.
Yes, surprising, isn't it?
You'd think it'd be the other way round.
Of course, you would be welcome to join us, Dolores.
So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.
So you both miraculously found boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?
Well, I hope you have more luck with these than you did with the last few.
- Will you be going, Eilis?
- Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
Well, you can take Dolores, then.
Of course.
God.
There's nobody here.
How are we supposed to get a fella if there's nobody here?
I expect most people will come after 9:00.
People or fellas?
Some of the people will be fellas.
I'd love to meet a fella.
They came.
The liars.
What a pair of bitches.
That's what the old woman called them.
She said they were all bitches.
Apart from you.
Well, hello.
Hello.
It's good to see you.
I can see why.
Come with us.
There.
That's better.
Now you don't look like you came in from milking the cows.
- Is that what I looked like?
- Just a bit.
Nice, clean cows.
One, two, three.
Two, two, three.
Not bad.
Two...
Maybe we can have a dance later.
I'm sorry?
- A dance, later.
- Oh.
Sure.
Would you like to dance?
Are you here with that guy, the one who was teaching you to dance?
- No.
- So would you dance with me?
I'm not sure he taught me anything.
Doesn't matter.
Secret is to look as though you know what you're doing.
I wish someone had told me that years ago.
Come on.
Where do you live?
- Clinton Street.
- Yeah?
That's on my way home.
Can I walk you?
I'm going to say yes and then I'm going to tell you why.
So I don't get the wrong idea?
I suppose so.
Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?
- You don't know her?
- I do.
She lives in my boarding house and she's awful.
If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.
- You'd be rescuing me.
- I get it.
I'm not Irish.
You don't sound Irish.
I need to make this clear.
No part of me is Irish.
I don't have Irish parents or grandparents or anything.
I'm Italian.
Well, my parents are, anyway.
So what were you doing at an Irish dance?
Don't the Italians have dances?
Yeah, and I wouldn't wanna take you to one.
They behave like Italians all night.
- What does that mean?
- Oh, you know.
No.
Hands.
Too many of them?
I guess it could seem that way if you was a girl.
Listen...
I want everything out in the open.
I came to the Irish dance... because I really like Irish girls.
And I was the only one who would dance with you?
Oh, no, it wasn't...
Oh, so you danced with loads of others?
This is me.
Can I take you next week, maybe get something to eat first?
That'd be nice.
Good night.
So...
What do you do when you're not working?
Well, there's school.
Just, you know, Brooklyn College.
I'm studying book-keeping.
You wanna be a book-keeper?
Well, I want to be an accountant one day, but, yes, book-keeping first.
- Wow.
- Mmm.
Is that difficult?
I'm talking too much.
Tell me about plumbing.
You know enough about plumbing already.
I don't know anything.
You know that taps drip and that toilets get blocked and that's all you need to know.
I mean, I don't know anything about book-keeping.
Well, there's a lot to it.
There's all the maths, of course, but that's not so complicated.
The double-entry system, that takes a while to get used to.
And we study company law too and that terrifies me.
So we had to read about an insurance company that went bankrupt in the 1930s and all the legal issues that went along with that.
She plays golf and she's really good at it and if she'd been at the dance last Saturday, then I don't think you'd have looked at me twice because Rose is beautiful.
I'm worried.
You haven't eaten anything.
Oh.
Too busy talking.
What is the matter with you girls now?
Nothing is the matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.
Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?
Eilis has a young man?
We didn't know.
She won't say anything about it.
And why should she to you awful gossipmongers?
Anyway, I met him on Saturday night when he called for Eilis, and he's a gentleman.
Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs Kehoe?
We know he's quite nice-looking.
Didn't like his shoes much.
What on Earth is wrong with his shoes?
They were a funny colour.
I'll tell you this much.
I'm going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness.
I see now that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin.
A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man, and the noise she makes is a lot worse.
Now, enough.
All I wanna do is travel home with you.
No food, no drink, no nothing.
I know you gotta study and get some sleep.
I'll take you to your house and say good night.
Otherwise, it's too long to wait.
I wanna ask you something and you're gonna say,
"Oh, it's too soon.
I don't really know him well enough.
"We only been out a couple of times."
Oh, it's nothing so bad.
It's just something that most guys, they...
Please just ask.
You're beginning to terrify me.
Oh...
Sure.
Will you come for dinner and meet my family sometime?
That's it?
I'd love to.
You like Italian food?
Don't know.
I've never eaten it.
It's the best food in the world.
Well, why would I not like it?
You're in a good mood, huh?
Yes.
Why?
It's just...
I like how you're being.
I don't know the word, when you go along with everything.
- Amenable.
- Yeah?
Amenable?
OK, so while you're being amenable, can we go see a movie this week when you're not in night class?
I'll sign up for two movies.
- Really?
- Yes.
Even if the first date is a disaster, I'll give it another chance.
Parkway's next stop.
Parkway's next.
It certainly feels like it, but this is my first year, so I don't know how to judge.
Well, congratulations.
You've survived your first New York winter.
Ah.
Wasn't so bad.
Really?
It's colder in Ireland?
Oh, no, it's colder here.
Over here that's how we judge the winter, on how cold it is.
But you have heating, heating everywhere.
You're only cold outside.
I guess that's true.
- Thank you for your help.
- Have a good day.
Eilis.
You're like a different person.
How did you do it?
Maybe I can pass some advice on to the next poor girl who feels that way.
I met somebody.
An Italian fella.
Oh, no.
I'm not passing that on.
I'd rather have them homesick than heartbroken.
Does he talk about baseball all the time?
- Or his mother?
- No.
Then keep him.
There isn't another Italian man like him in New York.
Hold it.
Now, remember you're getting off easy because we haven't got sauce.
Yeah, you have to remember that the sauce flies everywhere, so take it slowly.
I'm gonna say "splash" any time I see problems.
- Good idea.
- Can I start now?
- Yeah.
- Go.
Splash!
You just splashed his mother, his father, and the walls.
Let's go again.
Dear Rose.
I suppose the most important news is that I have a boyfriend.
He isn't as important as Bartocci's and my night classes, I know that, but I want to tell you everything that's going on.
Please don't mention it to Mammy, though.
You know what she's like.
He's decent and kind, and he has a job and he works hard.
We go to the cinema on Wednesdays and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.
I think of you and Mother every single day, but Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here
I didn't have before I met him.
My body was here, but my life was back in Ireland with you.
Now it's halfway across the sea.
So that's something, isn't it?
Oh, and I'd better warn you about Frankie.
- He's the little one?
- Yeah, he's eight going on 18.
I mean, he's nice and he's smart, but he's been talking and he's talking about all the things he's gonna say to you.
- What sort of things?
- We don't know.
It could be anything.
I mean, I tried to pay him money to go out and play ball with his friends and my dad, he threatened him, but I think he's looking forward to causing trouble, so much so he'll happily take a beating.
This is us here.
You ready?
Hey, how did you learn to eat spaghetti like that?
- I've been taking lessons.
- Lessons?
Like in a class?
You can do that?
Maybe I could teach it.
No, no, Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me cooked me some spaghetti and made me try and eat it without making a mess.
So what do you eat in Ireland?
Just Irish stew?
Not just.
We eat...
So, first of all, I should say that we don't like Irish people.
- Hey, watch it.
- Frankie.
What?
We don't.
That is a well-known fact.
Why, Frankie?
Cos a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up and he had to get stitches, and because all the cops around here are Irish nobody did anything about it.
There's probably two sides to it.
I might have said something I shouldn't.
You know, I can't remember now.
No, because they beat you up.
Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.
No, they just had red hair and big legs.
All right, up.
- Ow!
- Excuse us.
All I can say in his defence is he's the only one of us who'll get a college education.
If he can keep his mouth shut.
So, Tony tells me you go to college.
Oh, just night classes.
I want to be a book-keeper.
I like working in the shop well enough, but I don't want to be there forever.
I'm sorry, Eilis.
I'm an idiot.
I'm a rude idiot.
So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbets Field when the season starts?
You like baseball?
He never mentioned the Dodgers?
Not even once?
Tony, what's the matter with you?
You wanna know why?
Too much of this.
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbets Field if you wanna see him in the summer.
They're that important to you?
Put it this way, if our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants,
- it'd break my heart.
- Mine too.
She's not laughing, Tony.
Think it's too late.
She's a Yanks fan.
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?
She's a Yanks fan.
I love you.
I...
Thank you for the evening.
It was lovely.
Oh!
Sorry.
I'd finished.
Sheila, can I ask you something?
Why aren't you married?
Because my husband met somebody else and left me.
Oh...
I'm sorry.
And, well, would you get married again?
- Has somebody asked you?
- No.
Not really.
I won't ask what that means.
Would I get married again?
No, I wanna be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding house forever.
Of course I do.
That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.
I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom while some bad-tempered fella with hair growing out of his ears reads the newspaper on the toilet.
Then I'll wish I was back here talking to you.
Eilis!
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were coming.
Yeah, I know.
I thought you were gonna think that.
That's why I wanted to be here no matter what.
- I need to say something to you.
- Can you...
Can we just talk about something else until we get to Mrs Kehoe's?
- It's not...
- Please.
So...
Ten minutes before I'm supposed to meet you and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.
Yeah.
Even if you're thinking of inviting me in for a coffee,
I'd have to say no for your sake.
So how did you fix it in 10 minutes?
I didn't.
I spent the whole 10 minutes explaining to the lady
I had to be somewhere and I'd be back, and she don't wanna let me go.
So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?
Oh...
Well, what's the difference between six inches of sewage and a foot?
Will you let me say what I want to say?
I don't think you'll mind.
OK.
You remember that after I had dinner at your house, you told me you loved me?
Well, I didn't really know what to say.
But I know what to say now.
I have thought about you, and I like you.
And I like being with you.
And... maybe I feel the same way.
So the next time you tell me you love me, if there is a next time...
I'll say I love you too.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Holy shit.
Excuse my language, but I thought we were having a different kind of talk.
Can I go home now?
You love me?
Yes, but don't ask me anything else, and don't talk about our kids being Dodgers fans.
What, you want kids who like the Yankees?
- Tony, please, don't push me.
- All right.
I'm sorry.
Dear Eilis.
Thank you so much for the nylons.
The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.
It seems everything is so exciting and new compared to here.
I can't wait for you to show it all to me one day.
Oh, Eilis, you know I'm by your side, even when I'm not.
Well...
You're marvellous, that's all I have to say.
It looks to me as if you didn't just pass those exams.
No.
You flew through them.
I can't remember the last time anyone came in here with good news.
I've saved some money.
I'll be able to pay for next year's tuition and pay you back for last year.
One of my parishioners paid.
He needed to do something for mankind and I won't tell you why.
He's not out of the woods yet either, so he can cough up for next year, too.
I'd love to know what sort of woods he's in.
Yes, I'm sure you would, but you won't hear it from me.
Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.
You're not the miserable young girl who wanted to go home last winter.
It seems like years ago.
Now, I think this is the first time any girl of mine has ever passed an exam while living here.
- Have you told Tony yet, Eilis?
- Of course.
And is he taking you out to celebrate?
We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.
- Oh, boy.
- What does that mean?
Do you have a bathing costume?
- No, I was going to...
- Do you have sunglasses?
- No.
- You need sunglasses.
I read that if you don't have them on the beach this year, people'll talk about you.
And what exactly will they say, Sheila?
That's the thing, Mrs Kehoe.
You'd never know cos they'd never say it to your face.
Oh, dear God.
Diana's right, though, Eilis.
You need to think carefully about your costume.
It's the most Tony will ever have seen of you and you don't want to put him off.
You'll have to shave down there.
I'll give you a razor that'll do the trick.
You're all right there for the moment.
And most Italian men appreciate a fuller figure.
But watch yourself over the summer.
Black's too dark for your pale skin.
Let's see you in the green.
Why didn't you tell me to put my costume on underneath my clothes?
I thought you'd know.
Right, I'm ready.
- Tony.
- What?
Come on.
Dear Rose.
Thank you for your letter.
I was happy to hear about your golf tournament.
You must have been really pleased.
I still miss you and Mother and think about you every day, but I think I can say that for the first time since I've been in America
I'm really happy.
This has a lot to do with Tony.
At the weekend he took me to see the Brooklyn Dodgers, the baseball team he loves.
They lost, so he was annoyed.
But I've also started to look for office work too.
I had an interview this week at a textile firm here in Brooklyn.
Rose.
Who'd have thought there would be two book-keepers in the family?
Rose.
I'll soon be able to afford to come home and see you and Mammy.
Rose?
Rose.
Oh, my God.
Rose!
Oh, Rose!
One moment.
It was sudden.
I think perhaps she was ill, and she knew she was ill, and she didn't tell anybody.
- What'll happen?
- What can happen?
When will they bury her?
Tomorrow.
- Without me?
- Without you.
You're too far away, Eilis.
Why did I ever come here?
Rose wanted a better life for you.
She loved how well you were doing.
But I'll never see her again.
That's right, isn't it, Father?
I'll never see her again.
You know that I think you will.
And that she'll be watching over you every day for the rest of your life.
Hello.
Mammy?
I can't really hear you.
Well, the rain held off anyway.
And the whole of her golf club came, every single one of them.
We had a real houseful afterwards.
Are you still there?
Yes.
People really loved her, Eilis.
Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.
Nobody knew what to say to me.
When your daddy died, I said to myself that I shouldn't grieve too much because I had the two of you.
And then when you went to America,
I told myself the same thing because she was here with me.
But everyone's gone, Eilis.
I have nobody.
I can't bear it, Tony.
You wanna go home, I guess.
How would it be for you if I did go home?
I'd be afraid every single day.
Afraid that I wouldn't come back?
Yeah.
But home is home.
I'm not sure I have a home any more.
You're not going to work tomorrow, are you?
After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?
This is it.
We're gonna build five houses here if we can and Mom and Dad, they're gonna have one cos Ma always wanted a house with a backyard.
We'll sell three.
And the other one, my brothers, they asked me if I wanted it and I said that I did.
So I guess what I'm saying is, you wanna live out here on Long Island?
I mean, I know it doesn't look like much right now, but all the land around here has been sold, so we wouldn't be on our own, and there'd be telephone cables and electricity, everything.
We're gonna set up a company.
A building company, the three of us.
And I'm gonna do the plumbing and Laurence'll do the carpentry and...
Don't go all quiet on me.
At least tell me you'll think about it.
I don't need to think about it.
It's just for a month or so.
I know it'd make her feel a little better.
Will you marry me before you leave?
You don't trust me to come back?
Marry me.
Marry me.
We don't have to tell anybody.
We just do it quickly, just keep it between us.
Why do you want to do it?
Because if we don't, I'm gonna go crazy.
Would a promise not be the same?
If you can promise, you can easily do this.
So this is it.
This is where you live.
Yes, and if you make one tiny noise, she'll evict me.
There's no point in worrying now.
Stay with me.
You wanna play?
- Yeah, sure.
- All right, here we go.
One bat coming up, huh?
I'll take that.
All right, you ready?
Hands up.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Boom.
Oh!
Right down the third base line.
Is he annoying you?
- Cos he was annoying me.
- No, no, no, no.
I got a brother the exact same age.
- Hey, are you Irish?
- Is it so obvious?
I'm just about to marry an Irish girl, so I guess I notice it more.
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.
Sometimes it seems as though there can't be anybody left at home.
Where's your girl from?
Enniscorthy in County Wexford.
My wife has family there.
Hey, Eilis.
Come here a sec.
Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Come on, come over here.
Come on.
Will we ever tell our children we did this?
Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.
I wonder what they'll think of it.
- Nancy.
- You look so glamorous.
I told you so.
I'm so sorry about Rose.
Thank you.
How are you?
No.
I knew, but I wanted to let Nancy tell you herself.
I'm so glad you can come to the wedding.
Can I?
Your mother accepted the invitation on your behalf.
- When is it?
- The 27th of August.
Will you come out with George and me tomorrow night?
Annette wants to see you, too.
Oh, I don't mind.
I'll have to find you a key.
I don't want you getting me out of bed.
We all want to hear what life in New York is like.
I'll try and think of something to say.
I'm booked to go back to New York on the 21st.
Well, you can wait an extra week to see your best friend married.
I can't believe I'm married to someone you'll never know.
But you'd like him.
I know you would.
He's sweet.
And he's funny.
And he's got these wonderful eyes that...
I wish everything were different.
So, now, Mrs O'Toole from Cush.
Do we really have to do this?
Getting a letter of condolence isn't like getting a birthday present, is it?
What if Mrs O'Toole from Cush writes back to thank you for your thank you?
Then I'll thank her.
And you'd be happy to spend the rest of your life like that?
It's not as if I've anything else to do or anybody else to talk to.
It might as well be Mrs O'Toole from Cush.
What do you want me to say?
- That'll be Nancy and Annette.
- Off you go.
Enjoy yourself.
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.
It's a great pleasure to meet you.
We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.
There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.
OK.
Do you have to be with other fellas from the rugby club all the time?
No.
But Nancy told us we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you cos you have too much to say to each other, so we're just looking for company.
Oh, well.
Do you not like the fellas from the rugby club, Eilis?
I don't particularly, George.
When I first went to America,
I missed every single thing about Enniscorthy except one.
We're not all the same.
You all look the same.
It's the blazer and the hair oil.
Nancy.
Where's Annette?
And why has he come?
He's very nice, so don't be too hard on him.
Is this the same Jim Farrell that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?
- What happened to her?
- He broke it off.
He didn't think she was serious about him.
He was very upset for a while, but he's over her now.
Nancy, I'm...
I'm going back.
But you can have a bit of fun while you're here, can't you?
Come on, George.
How's your mother?
She's...
Well, she's sad.
She's got much older very quickly.
It was a terrible thing.
We all went to the funeral Mass,
Mother and Father and myself.
I didn't know that.
My mother played golf with her, you know.
She was very fond of her.
It was...
It was the saddest thing to happen in the town that I can remember.
Thank you.
Come on, you two.
And what about the skyscrapers?
Ah, but that's Manhattan.
I live in Brooklyn and I work in Brooklyn, and if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.
All the skyscrapers are across the river.
You don't make it sound very glamorous.
It's not, really.
Not even, what do you call it, the department store where you work?
Oh, Bartocci's?
Well, it sells lovely things.
But I can't afford many of them and I don't like the work, so...
What would you like to do?
I want to do what Rose did.
I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.
Well, you should call in at Davis's.
They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.
I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.
But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.
I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.
You just want her to stay.
I'm only thinking of Eilis.
Do you hear that, Eilis?
He's only thinking of you.
That's it, that's it.
Remember, Mrs Grogan didn't notice a thing.
- Good night.
- Good night.
See you.
How was your evening?
It was very nice, thank you.
Was that Jim Farrell I saw in the car with them?
It was.
His parents are moving, you know.
They're retiring to the country.
He'll be in that big house on his own.
- Is that right?
- Hmm.
He's a catch for someone.
Good night, Mammy.
- Hello, Eilis.
- Hello, Mrs Brennan.
Quite the star.
- Thank goodness you're back.
- What's the matter?
A lad from Davis's came round.
They have a problem in their accounts department.
They need you up there straightaway.
Is that all?
I'll just put the shopping away.
No, no, leave it.
Straightaway, the young fella said.
It doesn't matter what he said, Mother.
I'm not an employee.
I'd be doing them a favour.
Please, let me do the shopping.
The problem is that it's our busy season, so all the mill workers and drivers did overtime last week.
Well, they filled out the overtime slips, but there's been nobody here to work it all out and to add to the wage slips, and some of the men have started to complain, and I can't blame them.
As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.
Well, if you leave me for a couple of hours,
I can work out a system so that whoever comes in after me won't have any trouble.
Hello, Eilis.
Maria has been telling me you've done the most marvellous job here.
Thank you.
We should have known you would, of course.
You're Rose's sister, after all.
I'm told you have a certificate in book-keeping.
Is it American book-keeping?
I got the certificate in America, but the two systems are very similar.
Well, we'll certainly need someone to deal with wages and so on during the busy season.
So I'd like you to continue on a part-time basis.
Let's see how that goes and then we'll speak again.
I'll be going back to the United States soon.
As I say, let's you and I speak again before we make any firm decisions one way or the other.
Yes, Mr Brown.
Of course.
Thank you.
Now, if you go and see Maria, she'll have your money for today.
I'd forgotten.
What?
This.
You have beaches in Brooklyn.
Yes, but they're just very crowded.
There'll probably be quite a few walkers along here later.
Yes.
It's still not the same.
I'm sure it's not.
We don't really know anything of the rest of the world.
We must seem very backward to you now.
Of course not.
You seem calm and civilised and charming.
Come on!
My mother wanted you to know that the golf club is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.
A special trophy for the best score by a lady newcomer at the club.
She was always very nice to the newcomers, my mother says.
I hope you're pleased.
Yes.
Of course.
So every year someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?
Yeah, every year, as long as there's a golf club.
And I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.
Yeah, and my mother would like to meet you too, by the way.
I'm supposed to arrange a time when you can come around for tea.
Thank you.
I'd like that.
I wish it had been like this before I went.
Before Rose died.
Like what?
There was nothing here for me before and now I have a job and...
Here?
Is that an American trick?
Yes.
It's a good one, isn't it?
It's depressing, though, that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?
I mean, how long have they known about it?
A hundred years, probably.
I don't think they had bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.
We still don't have them now.
Well, come on.
You wanna go see the Dodgers on Saturday?
- Sure.
- OK.
- Will you do something for me?
- What?
If you laugh or you say anything about this to anybody in the family, you don't get to go see the Dodgers on Saturday or any other day of the season.
Also you get a beating.
Maybe it's just better if I don't get involved.
I really need your help, Frankie.
You know you're the best writer and reader in the family?
- Yeah.
- I'm trying to write to Eilis.
And I want it to be...
I don't know.
You've wrote before already about five times.
Yeah, but they're no good, Frankie, and...
She's only written back once.
She's never read my writing before.
I'm worried I'm putting her off me.
Listen, I'm eight years old.
I don't know anything about kissing.
You don't need to know anything about kissing.
You need to know about spelling and...
And...
- Grammar.
- Yeah.
Will you look?
Dear Eilis.
I hope that you are doing well in Ireland.
I hope that your mother's feeling less sad.
It will not be long before your friend gets married and you can come home.
This week, it's like the whole world's basements are flooding.
I've fixed three.
I've been working hard.
I've been saving money.
Everybody asks me about you all the time.
You missed out an "E," I think.
It's "everybody."
Anyway, I think that is all my news.
Mom and Dad and all my brothers, they all say hello.
I think about you most minutes of most days.
Even when I go see the Dodgers,
I do not concentrate on the games.
With love, your Tony.
No hair oil.
And that's not a blazer.
It's a sports jacket.
Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?
Are you trying to trick me?
No.
I knew what you meant when you said we were all the same.
It made me think that my life must seem very easy to you.
I run my father's bar.
I'm going to live in my parents' house.
I know what that must look like from the outside, but...
It doesn't feel like that.
What does it feel like?
And I've never been anywhere.
I've never even been to England but I'd like to see London and Paris and Rome.
New York.
It frightens me, the idea of dying without ever leaving Ireland.
And there are other things too.
I'm so sorry, I wanted to ask you a thousand things and all I've done is talked.
I'm glad.
- Really?
- Yes.
Will you finish that wretched pipe and sit with us?
I can hear perfectly well from where I am.
We're not here to provide you with entertainment.
Oh, don't you worry.
I found that out many years ago.
Just ignore him, Eilis.
It's as well Jim takes after me, not him.
Speak up.
Are you looking forward to your move?
We'll miss Enniscorthy, but it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.
Mother's worried about leaving me here on me own.
She thinks I'll destroy the place.
Well, I'm hoping you won't be on your own forever.
I'm sure he won't.
I mean...
God, aren't we blessed with this weather?
It's lovely.
The summers in New York are hot, eh?
They can be, yes.
It can get quite humid sometimes.
Dear Tony.
Thank you for your letters.
I want you to know that...
I don't know what I want you to know.
I don't want to be sitting right at the back.
We'll make sure you get the best seats in the house.
But it wouldn't feel right sitting up there with Nancy and George.
We'll find the second best seats in the house, then.
Would you like me to run ahead and save you a couple of places, Mrs Lacey?
Would you mind, Jim?
That'd be grand.
- Such a gentleman, isn't he?
- He is.
Came along at just the right time for us.
I invite you now, Nancy, to declare before God and his Church your consent to become George's wife.
I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.
I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.
The rings.
Lord, bless these rings.
Grant that those who wear them may always be faithful to each other.
May they do your will and live in peace with you in mutual love.
We ask this through Christ our Lord, amen.
Amen.
Your mother tells me things are working out very well for you in Enniscorthy, Eilis.
It was a lovely service.
And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving out to Glenbrien,
- so Jim'll...
- Yes, I know.
Jim and I promised my mother we'd take her back to the car.
Mmm!
Do you hear that?
"Jim and I. Jim and I."
It won't be long now by the sound of it and your mother will have a wonderful day out.
Will you excuse me?
There they are.
- Hello, Mrs Byrne.
How are you?
- Jack.
Can we talk?
What about?
The future.
I can't let you just go back to America without saying anything.
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.
So...
I don't want you to go.
I want you to stay here with me.
And I know that means asking you another question but I don't want to bombard you.
So I'll save that one for later.
Thank you.
I'm grateful.
And I'm flattered.
- That's all?
- No.
No, of course not.
I just...
I'd imagined a different life for myself.
I understand.
But your life here could be just as good.
Better even maybe.
Mary.
- I was just coming to fetch you.
- To fetch me?
I haven't worked for Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary.
Please come, Eilis.
She told me not to come back without you.
You know what she's like.
You look after things for five minutes while I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.
There are no customers in there at the moment, so I don't think you can make too much of a mess of things.
So, how have you been getting on?
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.
I heard that you're working over in Davis's, in the accounts department.
That's right.
And there's lots of talk about you and young Jim Farrell.
Oh, well, you know what people are like.
They love to talk.
Yes.
Do you remember Mrs Brady?
She usually comes into the shop on Sunday morning for her rashers.
No?
Well, you have a very busy life now, what with one thing and another.
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece living in Brooklyn.
The world is a small place, isn't it?
She had a letter from her a couple of weeks back.
And what did it say?
Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding at the city hall and her husband bumped into a girl from Enniscorthy who was getting married there.
I'm not sure what you're telling me, Miss Kelly.
He didn't bump into me.
Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.
Although I'm not sure that that's your name any longer, is it?
He couldn't remember.
Something Italian, he thought.
I'd forgotten.
You'd forgotten?
What a thing...
I'd forgotten what this town is like.
What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?
Keep me away from Jim?
Stop me from going back to America?
Perhaps you didn't even know.
My name is Eilis Fiorello.
- Putting you through now.
- Thank you.
How can I help?
Hello.
I'd like to make a reservation for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.
I think people spend even more money after a wedding.
Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.
She was buying firelighters in Broom's.
Firelighters in August.
But she'd seen Mrs Stapleton in there and she hadn't had a chance to go through the whole day in detail with her...
Eilis, what's the matter?
Has something happened with Jim?
Mammy, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm married.
I got married in Brooklyn before I came home.
And I should have told you.
I should have told you as soon as I got back.
I want to be with him.
I want to be with my husband.
Of course.
Is he nice?
Yes.
He'd have to be nice if you married him.
So you're going back?
Yes.
Tomorrow.
Are you on the early train?
I'm going to bed.
Mammy, it's not even 8:00.
You don't have to.
I'm very tired.
And I'd like to say goodbye now.
And only once.
Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.
I will.
Good night, Eilis.
So are you away to live in America?
- No.
- Just visiting?
No, I live there already.
Really?
What's it like?
It's a big place.
I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York.
Do you know it?
Yes.
People say that there are so many Irish people there, it's like home.
Is that right?
Yes.
It's just like home.
You're not to eat.
But I might be there years.
No, you can eat when you get there.
Don't eat on the boat.
It'll stop you getting so sick.
Do you promise me?
I promise.
And in a moment I want you to go straight down to your cabin and lock the bathroom door on your side.
When next door starts hammering, you can negotiate.
When you get to immigration, keep your eyes wide open.
Look as if you know where you're going.
You have to think like an American.
You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.
But you will, and it won't kill you.
And one day the sun will come out.
You might not even notice straightaway, it'll be that faint.
And then you'll catch yourself thinking about something or someone who has no connection with the past,
someone who's only yours, and you'll realise that this is where your life is.
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?
Not if what you're going to say will cause trouble for me in some way or another.
9:00 mass is over, girls.
- Now.
- Thank you.
- One moment, please.
- Excuse me.
And some rashers and some cheese.
Mrs Brady, what would you like this morning?
- Half a dozen rashers, please.
- Of course.
Eilis will get that for you now.
- I was next.
- And you still are.
- Yes?
- I need some shoe polish.
Shoe polish?
That's not really a Sunday item, now, is it?
These people need things for their dinner or their tea.
Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?
Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.
I'm sorry.
Miss Kelly...
I hadn't forgotten.
Spit it out, whatever it is.
I'm away to America.
Whose idea was that?
Father Flood in New York arranged it.
Rose used to play golf with him.
He sponsored me.
And he found me a job and got me a visa.
Well, we won't be needing you back here.
I could work every Sunday till I go.
No, thank you.
- Your poor sister.
- My sister?
Well, mothers are always being left behind in this country.
But Rose, that's the end for her now, isn't it?
She'll be looking after your mother for the rest of her life.
(Priest praying in Latin)
(Yawning)
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?
Not if what you're going to say will cause trouble for me in some way or another.
(Sighs)
(Church bell tolling) 9:00 mass is over, girls.
(lndistinct conversations)
- Now.
- (Man) Thank you.
- (Eilis) One moment, please.
- Excuse me.
(Woman) And some rashers and some cheese.
(Bell jingling)
Mrs Brady, what would you like this morning?
- Half a dozen rashers, please.
- Of course.
Eilis will get that for you now.
- I was next.
- And you still are.
- Yes?
- I need some shoe polish.
Shoe polish?
That's not really a Sunday item, now, is it?
These people need things for their dinner or their tea.
Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?
Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.
I'm sorry.
(Miss Kelly locks door)
Miss Kelly...
I hadn't forgotten.
Spit it out, whatever it is.
I'm away to America.
Whose idea was that?
Father Flood in New York arranged it.
Rose used to play golf with him.
He sponsored me.
And he found me a job and got me a visa.
Well, we won't be needing you back here.
I could work every Sunday till I go.
No, thank you.
- Your poor sister.
- My sister?
Well, mothers are always being left behind in this country.
But Rose, that's the end for her now, isn't it?
She'll be looking after your mother for the rest of her life.
I wish I'd written to Father Flood about you, Rose.
Me?
I have a job.
You had a couple of hours on a Sunday working for Nettles Kelly.
You shouldn't call her that.
I think it's quite a kind name.
Considering she's actually a terrible old witch.
Well, I don't want to talk about her any more.
Good.
They say it's hotter there in the summer and colder in the winter.
What in heaven's name will she do about clothes?
She'll buy them, Mother.
She doesn't want to be wasting her money on clothes.
She won't have much choice.
She'll be there for...
(Laughs)
- You look beautiful, Nancy.
- Thank you.
You look so beautiful.
It makes me despair of this place.
(Laughs) Why?
Well, you're the prettiest girl in County Wexford.
You should be able to choose any man you want and we're hoping that George Sheridan from the rugby club looks your way.
Do you think he might?
Of course he will.
I know you like him, Nancy, but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?
And those boys with their hair oil and their blazers.
- NANCY:
He has beautiful eyes.
- Mmm...
And he's going to come into a beautiful shop in the market square.
Why didn't you wear your blue dress?
Are you asking why I didn't make more of an effort?
I suppose cos I'm going away.
- Mind, now.
- (Both laughing)
Come on.
- (♪ Irish folk) - (lndistinct conversations)
(Boys chattering indistinctly)
He's looked over here twice already.
He hasn't!
- He's walking over here now.
- He's not!
Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridan's doing?
(Clears throat) Would you like to dance?
(Chuckles)
(Sighs)
(Rose) Is that really everything you own?
Oh, Eilis.
I should have looked after you better.
You've bought most of the clothes in this case.
That's one of the reasons I'm going, cos I can't buy my own.
If it was just that, I'd spend every penny I had on you.
Gladly.
But I can't buy you a future.
I can't buy you the kind of life you need.
I know.
But you'll come see me there one day?
Yes.
And you'll look after yourself?
You don't have to worry about me.
And I'll come home to visit, won't I?
Cos I couldn't bear it if...
You haven't packed your shoes yet.
They'll take up a bit of room.
There.
(Horn blowing)
Oh!
I'm sorry.
(Sighs)
Off.
Number one, bottom bunk, that's mine.
You're on the top.
This is hell.
- Never again.
- Never again to America?
The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.
I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.
Let's go for a smoke.
I don't.
Suit yourself.
I'll see you later.
Unless I find a nice man in First to smoke with.
It's good to see that not everybody's put off their dinner by the weather forecast.
It's supposed to be a rough one tonight, so none of the other passengers are eating.
A few spoonfuls of soup maybe, but not the mutton stew.
Please unlock it.
(Breathing heavily)
(Girl) Go away!
(Retches)
(Vomits)
(Breathing heavily)
(Eilis) I'm sorry about the smell.
And the bucket.
Don't worry.
The whole boat stinks.
Even First Class.
I've just been thrown out of there, by the way.
The bathroom door was locked all night.
Oh, those bastards.
There.
Won't be very comfortable, but at least it's ours.
(Knocking on door)
- (Girl) Open the door.
- Feck off.
- Open the door right now.
- Do you hear me?
Fuck off.
If you'd been nice last night, we would have played fair.
- Now you've got no toilet.
- Get out of the bathroom.
You bastards.
(Laughs)
Go on, you can use it.
I'm going to get us some water.
That's all you're allowed.
(Door closes)
(Georgina) Are you going to live in America?
(Eilis) Yes.
(Georgina) You have papers and everything?
(Eilis) Yes.
And a job.
How'd you manage to arrange all that?
I didn't.
Someone did it for me.
A priest my sister knows.
And how do you feel about it?
How long do letters from Ireland take to arrive?
My sister Rose said she'd write straightaway.
They take a long time at first.
And then no time at all.
You have family in America?
Friends?
No.
You'll meet people easily enough.
Where are you gonna live?
Brooklyn?
- How'd you know that?
- Lucky guess.
Try to remember that sometimes it's nice to talk to people who don't know your auntie.
That's what it's like?
That's what it's like.
I haven't been sick for hours.
Nice, isn't it?
I'm very hungry.
That's why you haven't been sick for hours.
We'll eat tomorrow.
Or the day after.
Oh, dear.
We're gonna have to do something with you.
They'll put you in quarantine or something if you try and enter the country looking like that.
Nothing fancy.
You mustn't look like a tart.
Oh, well, looking like a tart isn't going to be a problem.
This doesn't look too bad.
My sister gave me that.
Wear it with this and this.
(Guard shouts) Have your bags ready for inspection.
(Georgina) Don't look too innocent, though.
I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.
Perhaps a little eye liner.
(Official) Step out of the line, please.
Thank you.
Next, please.
Thank you.
Step over this way, please.
Get out of the line.
Next.
Passport, please.
(Georgina) Stand up straight.
Polish your shoes.
And don't cough, whatever you do.
(Guard) Over this way.
(Georgina) Don't be rude or pushy, but don't look too nervous.
(Guard) Step this way.
(Georgina) Think like an American.
You have to know where you're going.
Welcome to the United States, ma'am.
Through the blue door, please.
Next, please.
(Children playing)
(Mrs Kehoe) Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, amen.
Amen.
I saw you had a letter today, Diana.
Any news?
Mr de Valera's had another operation on his eyes, she says.
He's been in Holland.
I don't want news I can read in a newspaper.
Anyway, we would describe Mr de Valera as politics, would we not, Mrs Kehoe?
And we do not like politics at the dinner table.
We don't.
It's not politics to talk about eye operations.
It is if the eyes belong to a politician.
And I don't like to talk about hospitals very much either.
Patty, did you have any luck with that cold cream?
No, Mrs Kehoe.
I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.
And I showed her the advertisement.
I don't want to have to travel all the way into Manhattan just for a jar of cold cream.
Maybe you could have a look in Bartocci's for me, Eilis?
Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.
She doesn't know that for sure, Mrs Kehoe.
She's only saying that Bartocci's is a better store than Webster's to get at Patty.
They're both very good and you girls are very lucky to be working there.
Eilis, from the look of you, you have greasy skin.
Is that right?
What do you do about that?
Just...
Well, I wash it, Mrs Kehoe, with soap.
There's nothing wrong with soap.
Soap was good enough for Our Lord, I expect.
Oh, and which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?
Does the Bible tell you that?
Our Lord was a man, anyway.
He didn't care about greasy skin.
- (Chuckles)
- Ladies, no more talk about
Our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.
The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis.
- Won't you, girls?
- (Both) Mmm-hmm.
(Dings)
Hi.
- Good morning.
- Did you go out last night?
- Out, the opposite of in.
- No.
Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.
"What did you see, Dorothy?"
"I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis.
They filmed it in Ireland."
"Oh, I'm from Ireland."
"I know you are.
That's why I thought you might be interested."
Thank you.
(Air hissing)
Shouldn't be a moment.
Is it still hot out there?
I haven't been outside since this morning.
But I can tell that it might be very.
It just looks it.
It's warm, yes.
- (Dings) - (Air hissing)
Thanks very much.
Remember, if people like it here, they'll come back, so you treat every customer as if she's a new friend.
- I'll try.
- It's not a matter of trying.
It's what you have to do.
Do you try to wear panties every day?
No.
I mean, I don't...
I don't try.
I just put them on.
You see what I'm saying?
Yes.
Good.
(Customer) Can we get another side of toast, please?
(Man) Slice up some hot dogs.
They want 'em sliced down the middle.
(♪ Be Cool Aka Keep Cool on radio)
Sorry.
Could I have the bill, please?
I hope that when I go through the Pearly Gates, the first sound I hear is you asking me for the cheque in that lovely Irish brogue.
(Sighs)
(Patty) Diana?
Have they told you a date for the nylon sale yet, Eilis?
Never had a Bartocci's girl living here.
Might get some inside information.
I haven't been told anything.
- I bet you wouldn't let on if you had.
- She's that sort.
More loyal to her bosses than to her friends.
- Like a Red spy.
- Oh, dear God.
I'll thank you to keep His name out of a conversation about nylons.
He might be everywhere, but he's certainly not in Bartocci's on sale day.
Sorry, Mrs Kehoe.
I was glad to see you finally got some letters from home today, Eilis.
Did I?
I forgot to check.
They'll still be there after dinner.
Sorry.
(Rose) Dear Eilis.
It's hard for me to believe that you're reading this in America, thousands of miles across the sea.
The big news here is that since you left,
Mammy has stopped shopping at Nettles Kelly's.
As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh and she overcharged for everything...
- (Sniffles)
- And she's awful.
(Mary) I haven't told her to her face.
There's no need.
She knows that she overcharges and her bread's not fresh.
(Rose) We talk about you every evening, of course.
We want to know everything.
I'm sure you're busy, but even if your letters were 200 pages, they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.
(Sobbing)
Take care of yourself.
Love.
Is it your time of the month?
So what is it?
Take some time off now.
Go and sit in the staff room.
(Door opens)
I'm so sorry, Eilis.
This is all my fault.
I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.
Franco Bartocci says you're doing great here.
Ma Kehoe says you're the nicest lodger she's ever had.
- What?
- "Ma Kehoe"?
Don't ever call her that to her face.
(Chuckles)
I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.
I've enrolled you in a night class, for book-keeping.
Brooklyn College.
It'll be three nights a week and I've paid your tuition for the first semester.
- Why?
- Why?
Not thank you?
Sorry.
Thank you.
But why?
Well, I was amazed that someone as clever as you couldn't find proper work at home.
I've been here too long.
I forget what it's like in Ireland.
So when your sister wrote to me about you,
I said the Church would try to help.
Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.
I wish that I could stop feeling that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.
All I can say is that it will pass.
Homesickness is like most sicknesses.
It'll make you feel wretched and then it'll move on to somebody else.
Now, Taylor v. Standard Gas Company is one of the most important corporate cases decided in the Supreme Court in the last 20 years.
This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock Doctrine, so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.
In public utility integration proceedings alone, literally thousands of investors may be affected by its application.
(Bell ringing)
Did you understand any of that?
I mean, a single word?
(Chuckles)
He's not even reading from a book.
He just knows all this.
Well, let's hope the next hour's easier, huh?
One of the things that ruins Christmas in America is the turkey.
It all tastes of sawdust.
So that's one cheese sandwich for Miss McAdam and extra turkey for everyone else.
(Laughing)
Ladies, please.
(Snorts)
Eilis, Father Flood told me about your Christmas plans.
Oh, you're not serving lunch to the old fellas who've nowhere to go, are you?
He asks us every year.
We always say no.
Eilis, you're a saint.
They smell awful.
Sheila knows how they smell because that's where she goes husband hunting.
(Laughing)
It's a marvellous thing you're doing, Eilis.
A Christian thing.
I wish there were more like you.
(Woman) In you come.
How many are we expecting?
We had a hundred last year.
There may be more this.
(Eilis) Are they all Irish?
(Father Flood) All Irish.
Why don't they go home?
If there's nothing there for clever young girls such as yourself, there's gonna be even less for men like these.
Some of them have been here 50 years.
They've lost touch with everyone.
Lovely.
Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.
These are the men who built the tunnels, the bridges, the highways.
God alone knows what they live on now.
- (♪ Irish folk) - (lndistinct conversations)
Anyway... (Whistles)
I don't want to interrupt proceedings, but I'm sure you'd all like to show your appreciation to all the ladies here for their hard day's work.
And by way of a thank you, we have a great singer in the room with us today.
- Frankie.
- (All applauding)
(Singing in Gaelic)
(inaudible)
Mind yourself, there.
(Door closes)
- (lndistinct conversations) - (Girls laughing)
Would you like to come into the front room for a glass of something?
You've earned it.
(♪ Opera on radio)
You survived.
Ah...
- It wasn't so bad.
- (Chuckles)
- Happy Christmas.
- Cheers.
(Clinking)
Now, Miss McAdam is leaving us.
She's going to live with her sister in Manhattan.
She has the best room in the house, the basement, and it has its own entrance.
Now, I can only let a certain kind of girl stay there.
Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.
Although I will admit, God did give Miss McAdam an advantage when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.
No, no, you're a pretty girl, Eilis, but you're sensible.
So, you're having the room and that's that.
Will the other girls not mind?
Oh, I expect so.
What don't they mind?
Girls, you'll take Dolores to the dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?
There's a dance?
(Mrs Kehoe) At the parish hall.
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.
Um...
Patty and I aren't going this week.
We're going to see a movie instead.
Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.
I would, very much.
There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.
Yes, surprising, isn't it?
You'd think it'd be the other way round.
(Girls laughing)
Of course, you would be welcome to join us, Dolores.
So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.
So you both miraculously found boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?
Well, I hope you have more luck with these than you did with the last few.
- Will you be going, Eilis?
- Yes, Mrs Kehoe.
Well, you can take Dolores, then.
Of course.
(♪ Irish folk)
God.
There's nobody here.
How are we supposed to get a fella if there's nobody here?
I expect most people will come after 9:00.
People or fellas?
Some of the people will be fellas.
I'd love to meet a fella.
(Door opens)
(Dolores) They came.
The liars.
What a pair of bitches.
That's what the old woman called them.
She said they were all bitches.
Apart from you.
Well, hello.
- Hello.
It's good to see you.
- (Music stops)
- I can see why.
- (Applause)
(Chuckles)
- Come with us.
- (♪ Irish folk)
There.
That's better.
Now you don't look like you came in from milking the cows.
- Is that what I looked like?
- Just a bit.
Nice, clean cows.
- (♪ Irish folk) - (Young man) One, two, three.
Two, two, three.
Not bad.
Two... (Continues counting)
(Diana laughing)
Maybe we can have a dance later.
I'm sorry?
- A dance, later.
- Oh.
Sure.
Would you like to dance?
Are you here with that guy, the one who was teaching you to dance?
- No.
- So would you dance with me?
I'm not sure he taught me anything.
Doesn't matter.
Secret is to look as though you know what you're doing.
I wish someone had told me that years ago.
Come on.
(♪ Jazz)
Where do you live?
- Clinton Street.
- Yeah?
That's on my way home.
Can I walk you?
I'm going to say yes and then I'm going to tell you why.
So I don't get the wrong idea?
I suppose so.
Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?
- You don't know her?
- (Chuckles) I do.
She lives in my boarding house and she's awful.
If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.
- You'd be rescuing me.
- I get it.
I'm not Irish.
You don't sound Irish.
- I need to make this clear.
- (Car horn honking)
No part of me is Irish.
I don't have Irish parents or grandparents or anything.
I'm Italian.
Well, my parents are, anyway.
So what were you doing at an Irish dance?
Don't the Italians have dances?
Yeah, and I wouldn't wanna take you to one.
They behave like Italians all night.
- What does that mean?
- Oh, you know.
No.
Hands.
Too many of them?
I guess it could seem that way if you was a girl.
Listen...
I want everything out in the open.
I came to the Irish dance... because I really like Irish girls.
And I was the only one who would dance with you?
Oh, no, it wasn't...
Oh, so you danced with loads of others?
(Chuckles softly)
(Eilis) This is me.
Can I take you next week, maybe get something to eat first?
That'd be nice.
Good night.
(Gate creaks)
- (♪ Jazz) - (lndistinct conversations)
So...
What do you do when you're not working?
Well, there's school.
Just, you know, Brooklyn College.
I'm studying book-keeping.
You wanna be a book-keeper?
Well, I want to be an accountant one day, but, yes, book-keeping first.
- Wow.
- Mmm.
Is that difficult?
I'm talking too much.
Tell me about plumbing.
You know enough about plumbing already.
I don't know anything.
You know that taps drip and that toilets get blocked and that's all you need to know.
I mean, I don't know anything about book-keeping.
Well, there's a lot to it.
There's all the maths, of course, but that's not so complicated.
The double-entry system, that takes a while to get used to.
And we study company law too and that terrifies me.
So we had to read about an insurance company that went bankrupt in the 1930s and all the legal issues that went along with that.
She plays golf and she's really good at it and if she'd been at the dance last Saturday, then I don't think you'd have looked at me twice because Rose is beautiful.
I'm worried.
You haven't eaten anything.
Oh. (Chuckles)
Too busy talking.
What is the matter with you girls now?
Nothing is the matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.
Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?
Eilis has a young man?
We didn't know.
She won't say anything about it.
And why should she to you awful gossipmongers?
(Both laughing)
Anyway, I met him on Saturday night when he called for Eilis, and he's a gentleman.
Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs Kehoe?
We know he's quite nice-looking.
Didn't like his shoes much.
What on Earth is wrong with his shoes?
- They were a funny colour.
- (Both laugh)
I'll tell you this much.
I'm going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness.
I see now that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin.
A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man,
- and the noise she makes is a lot worse.
- (Snorting)
Now, enough.
- (School bell ringing) - (lndistinct conversations)
All I wanna do is travel home with you.
No food, no drink, no nothing.
I know you gotta study and get some sleep.
I'll take you to your house and say good night.
Otherwise, it's too long to wait.
I wanna ask you something and you're gonna say,
"Oh, it's too soon.
I don't really know him well enough.
"We only been out a couple of times."
Oh, it's nothing so bad.
It's just something that most guys, they...
Please just ask.
You're beginning to terrify me.
Oh...
Sure.
Will you come for dinner and meet my family sometime?
That's it?
I'd love to.
You like Italian food?
Don't know.
I've never eaten it.
It's the best food in the world.
Well, why would I not like it?
You're in a good mood, huh?
Yes.
Why?
It's just...
I like how you're being.
I don't know the word, when you go along with everything.
- Amenable.
- Yeah?
Amenable?
OK, so while you're being amenable, can we go see a movie this week when you're not in night class?
I'll sign up for two movies.
- Really?
- Yes.
Even if the first date is a disaster, I'll give it another chance.
(Sighs happily)
(Tram bell rings)
(Conductor) Parkway's next stop.
Parkway's next.
(Air hissing)
(Eilis) It certainly feels like it, but this is my first year, so I don't know how to judge.
Well, congratulations.
You've survived your first New York winter.
Ah.
Wasn't so bad.
Really?
It's colder in Ireland?
Oh, no, it's colder here.
(Chuckles)
- (Machine dings)
- Over here that's how we judge the winter, on how cold it is.
But you have heating, heating everywhere.
You're only cold outside.
I guess that's true.
- Thank you for your help.
- Have a good day.
Eilis.
You're like a different person.
How did you do it?
Maybe I can pass some advice on to the next poor girl who feels that way.
I met somebody.
An Italian fella.
Oh, no.
I'm not passing that on.
I'd rather have them homesick than heartbroken.
Does he talk about baseball all the time?
- Or his mother?
- No.
Then keep him.
There isn't another Italian man like him in New York.
Hold it.
Now, remember you're getting off easy because we haven't got sauce.
Yeah, you have to remember that the sauce flies everywhere, so take it slowly.
I'm gonna say "splash" any time I see problems.
- Good idea.
- Can I start now?
- Yeah.
- Go.
- DIANA:
Splash!
- (Sighs)
You just splashed his mother, his father, and the walls.
Let's go again.
(Eilis) Dear Rose.
I suppose the most important news is that I have a boyfriend.
He isn't as important as Bartocci's and my night classes, I know that, but I want to tell you everything that's going on.
Please don't mention it to Mammy, though.
You know what she's like.
He's decent and kind, and he has a job and he works hard.
We go to the cinema on Wednesdays and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.
I think of you and Mother every single day, but Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here
I didn't have before I met him.
My body was here,
- (Sobbing) - but my life was back in Ireland with you.
Now it's halfway across the sea.
So that's something, isn't it?
Oh, and I'd better warn you about Frankie.
- He's the little one?
- Yeah, he's eight going on 18.
I mean, he's nice and he's smart, but he's been talking and he's talking about all the things he's gonna say to you.
- What sort of things?
- We don't know.
It could be anything.
I mean, I tried to pay him money to go out and play ball with his friends and my dad, he threatened him, but I think he's looking forward to causing trouble, so much so he'll happily take a beating.
This is us here.
You ready?
Hey, how did you learn to eat spaghetti like that?
- I've been taking lessons.
- Lessons?
Like in a class?
You can do that?
Maybe I could teach it.
No, no, Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me cooked me some spaghetti and made me try and eat it without making a mess.
So what do you eat in Ireland?
Just Irish stew?
Not just.
We eat...
So, first of all, I should say that we don't like Irish people.
(Mr Fiorello) Hey, watch it.
(Mrs Fiorello) Frankie.
What?
We don't.
That is a well-known fact.
Why, Frankie?
Cos a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up and he had to get stitches, and because all the cops around here are Irish nobody did anything about it.
There's probably two sides to it.
I might have said something I shouldn't.
You know, I can't remember now.
No, because they beat you up.
Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.
No, they just had red hair and big legs.
All right, up.
- Ow!
- Excuse us.
(All chuckling)
All I can say in his defence is he's the only one of us who'll get a college education.
If he can keep his mouth shut.
So, Tony tells me you go to college.
Oh, just night classes.
I want to be a book-keeper.
I like working in the shop well enough, but I don't want to be there forever.
I'm sorry, Eilis.
I'm an idiot.
I'm a rude idiot.
(All laughing)
So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbets Field when the season starts?
You like baseball?
He never mentioned the Dodgers?
Not even once?
(Mr Fiorello) Tony, what's the matter with you?
You wanna know why?
Too much of this.
(Mimics kissing)
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbets Field if you wanna see him in the summer.
They're that important to you?
Put it this way, if our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants,
- it'd break my heart.
- (Maurizio) Mine too.
She's not laughing, Tony.
Think it's too late.
- She's a Yanks fan.
- (All protesting)
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?
She's a Yanks fan.
I love you.
I...
Thank you for the evening.
It was lovely.
Oh!
Sorry.
I'd finished.
Sheila, can I ask you something?
Why aren't you married?
Because my husband met somebody else and left me.
Oh...
I'm sorry.
And, well, would you get married again?
- Has somebody asked you?
- No.
Not really.
I won't ask what that means.
Would I get married again?
No, I wanna be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding house forever.
Of course I do.
That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.
I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom while some bad-tempered fella with hair growing out of his ears reads the newspaper on the toilet.
Then I'll wish I was back here talking to you.
(School bell ringing)
(Tony) Eilis!
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were coming.
Yeah, I know.
I thought you were gonna think that.
That's why I wanted to be here no matter what.
- I need to say something to you.
- Can you...
Can we just talk about something else until we get to Mrs Kehoe's?
- It's not...
- Please.
So...
Ten minutes before I'm supposed to meet you and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.
- Yeah.
- (Chuckles)
Even if you're thinking of inviting me in for a coffee,
I'd have to say no for your sake.
So how did you fix it in 10 minutes?
I didn't.
I spent the whole 10 minutes explaining to the lady
I had to be somewhere and I'd be back, and she don't wanna let me go.
So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?
- Oh...
- (Laughs)
Well, what's the difference between six inches of sewage and a foot?
Will you let me say what I want to say?
I don't think you'll mind.
OK.
You remember that after I had dinner at your house, you told me you loved me?
Well, I didn't really know what to say.
But I know what to say now.
I have thought about you, and I like you.
And I like being with you.
And... maybe I feel the same way.
So the next time you tell me you love me, if there is a next time...
I'll say I love you too.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Holy shit.
Excuse my language, but I thought we were having a different kind of talk.
Can I go home now?
You love me?
Yes, but don't ask me anything else, and don't talk about our kids being Dodgers fans.
What, you want kids who like the Yankees?
- Tony, please, don't push me.
- All right.
I'm sorry.
(Rose) Dear Eilis.
Thank you so much for the nylons.
The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.
It seems everything is so exciting and new compared to here.
I can't wait for you to show it all to me one day.
Oh, Eilis, you know I'm by your side, even when I'm not.
(Children playing)
Well...
You're marvellous, that's all I have to say.
It looks to me as if you didn't just pass those exams.
No.
You flew through them.
I can't remember the last time anyone came in here with good news.
I've saved some money.
I'll be able to pay for next year's tuition and pay you back for last year.
One of my parishioners paid.
He needed to do something for mankind and I won't tell you why.
He's not out of the woods yet either, so he can cough up for next year, too.
I'd love to know what sort of woods he's in.
Yes, I'm sure you would, but you won't hear it from me.
(Chuckles)
Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.
You're not the miserable young girl who wanted to go home last winter.
It seems like years ago.
Now, I think this is the first time any girl of mine has ever passed an exam while living here.
- Have you told Tony yet, Eilis?
- Of course.
And is he taking you out to celebrate?
We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.
- Oh, boy.
- What does that mean?
Do you have a bathing costume?
- No, I was going to...
- Do you have sunglasses?
- No.
- You need sunglasses.
I read that if you don't have them on the beach this year, people'll talk about you.
And what exactly will they say, Sheila?
That's the thing, Mrs Kehoe.
You'd never know cos they'd never say it to your face.
Oh, dear God.
Diana's right, though, Eilis.
You need to think carefully about your costume.
It's the most Tony will ever have seen of you and you don't want to put him off.
You'll have to shave down there.
I'll give you a razor that'll do the trick.
You're all right there for the moment.
And most Italian men appreciate a fuller figure.
But watch yourself over the summer.
Black's too dark for your pale skin.
Let's see you in the green.
- (lndistinct conversations) - (♪ Zing A Little Zong on speakers)
Why didn't you tell me to put my costume on underneath my clothes?
I thought you'd know.
Right, I'm ready.
(Whistles)
- Tony.
- What?
Come on.
(Eilis) Dear Rose.
Thank you for your letter.
I was happy to hear about your golf tournament.
You must have been really pleased.
I still miss you and Mother and think about you every day, but I think I can say that for the first time since I've been in America
I'm really happy.
This has a lot to do with Tony.
At the weekend he took me to see the Brooklyn Dodgers, the baseball team he loves.
They lost, so he was annoyed.
But I've also started to look for office work too.
I had an interview this week at a textile firm here in Brooklyn.
Rose.
(Eilis) Who'd have thought there would be two book-keepers in the family?
Rose.
(Eilis) I'll soon be able to afford to come home and see you and Mammy.
Rose?
Rose.
Oh, my God.
(Sobs)
Rose!
Oh, Rose!
(Crying)
One moment.
It was sudden.
I think perhaps she was ill, and she knew she was ill, and she didn't tell anybody.
- What'll happen?
- What can happen?
When will they bury her?
Tomorrow.
- Without me?
- Without you.
You're too far away, Eilis.
Why did I ever come here?
Rose wanted a better life for you.
She loved how well you were doing.
But I'll never see her again.
That's right, isn't it, Father?
I'll never see her again.
You know that I think you will.
And that she'll be watching over you every day for the rest of your life.
(Gasps)
(Phone ringing)
Hello.
Mammy?
(lndistinct)
I can't really hear you.
Well, the rain held off anyway.
And the whole of her golf club came, every single one of them.
We had a real houseful afterwards.
Are you still there?
Yes.
People really loved her, Eilis.
Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.
Nobody knew what to say to me.
When your daddy died, I said to myself that I shouldn't grieve too much because I had the two of you.
And then when you went to America,
I told myself the same thing because she was here with me.
But everyone's gone, Eilis.
I have nobody.
(Sobbing)
I can't bear it, Tony.
You wanna go home, I guess.
How would it be for you if I did go home?
I'd be afraid every single day.
Afraid that I wouldn't come back?
Yeah.
But home is home.
I'm not sure I have a home any more.
You're not going to work tomorrow, are you?
After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?
(Tony) This is it.
We're gonna build five houses here if we can and Mom and Dad, they're gonna have one cos Ma always wanted a house with a backyard.
We'll sell three.
And the other one, my brothers, they asked me if I wanted it and I said that I did.
So I guess what I'm saying is, you wanna live out here on Long Island?
I mean, I know it doesn't look like much right now, but all the land around here has been sold, so we wouldn't be on our own, and there'd be telephone cables and electricity, everything.
We're gonna set up a company.
A building company, the three of us.
And I'm gonna do the plumbing and Laurence'll do the carpentry and...
Don't go all quiet on me.
At least tell me you'll think about it.
I don't need to think about it.
(Sighs)
It's just for a month or so.
I know it'd make her feel a little better.
Will you marry me before you leave?
You don't trust me to come back?
Marry me.
Marry me.
We don't have to tell anybody.
We just do it quickly, just keep it between us.
Why do you want to do it?
Because if we don't, I'm gonna go crazy.
Would a promise not be the same?
If you can promise, you can easily do this.
So this is it.
This is where you live.
(Whispering) Yes, and if you make one tiny noise, she'll evict me.
(Breathing heavily)
(Belt buckle jangling)
- (Grunts) - (Gasps)
(Panting)
(Tony grunting)
(Footsteps approaching)
There's no point in worrying now.
Stay with me.
(Tony) You wanna play?
(Boy) Yeah, sure.
(Tony) All right, here we go.
One bat coming up, huh?
I'll take that.
All right, you ready?
Hands up.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Boom.
Oh!
Right down the third base line.
(Man) Is he annoying you?
- Cos he was annoying me.
- No, no, no, no.
I got a brother the exact same age.
- Hey, are you Irish?
- Is it so obvious?
I'm just about to marry an Irish girl, so I guess I notice it more.
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.
Sometimes it seems as though there can't be anybody left at home.
Where's your girl from?
(Tony) Enniscorthy in County Wexford.
(Man) My wife has family there.
Hey, Eilis.
Come here a sec.
(Official) Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.
(Man) Good luck.
(Tony) Thank you.
Come on, come over here.
Come on.
Will we ever tell our children we did this?
Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.
I wonder what they'll think of it.
(♪ Organ)
- Nancy.
- You look so glamorous.
I told you so.
I'm so sorry about Rose.
Thank you.
How are you?
No.
I knew, but I wanted to let Nancy tell you herself.
I'm so glad you can come to the wedding.
Can I?
Your mother accepted the invitation on your behalf.
- When is it?
- The 27th of August.
Will you come out with George and me tomorrow night?
Annette wants to see you, too.
Oh, I don't mind.
I'll have to find you a key.
I don't want you getting me out of bed.
We all want to hear what life in New York is like.
I'll try and think of something to say.
I'm booked to go back to New York on the 21st.
Well, you can wait an extra week to see your best friend married.
I can't believe I'm married to someone you'll never know.
But you'd like him.
I know you would.
He's sweet.
And he's funny.
And he's got these wonderful eyes that... (Sighing)
(Sniffles) I wish everything were different.
So, now, Mrs O'Toole from Cush.
Do we really have to do this?
Getting a letter of condolence isn't like getting a birthday present, is it?
What if Mrs O'Toole from Cush writes back to thank you for your thank you?
Then I'll thank her.
And you'd be happy to spend the rest of your life like that?
It's not as if I've anything else to do or anybody else to talk to.
It might as well be Mrs O'Toole from Cush.
What do you want me to say?
(Car horn honking)
- That'll be Nancy and Annette.
- Off you go.
Enjoy yourself.
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.
It's a great pleasure to meet you.
We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.
There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.
(George) OK.
Do you have to be with other fellas from the rugby club all the time?
No. (Chuckles)
But Nancy told us we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you cos you have too much to say to each other, so we're just looking for company.
Oh, well.
Do you not like the fellas from the rugby club, Eilis?
I don't particularly, George.
When I first went to America,
I missed every single thing about Enniscorthy except one.
We're not all the same.
You all look the same.
It's the blazer and the hair oil.
(Laughing)
Nancy.
Where's Annette?
And why has he come?
He's very nice, so don't be too hard on him.
Is this the same Jim Farrell that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?
- What happened to her?
- He broke it off.
He didn't think she was serious about him.
He was very upset for a while, but he's over her now.
Nancy, I'm...
I'm going back.
But you can have a bit of fun while you're here, can't you?
Come on, George.
How's your mother?
She's...
Well, she's sad.
She's got much older very quickly.
It was a terrible thing.
We all went to the funeral Mass,
Mother and Father and myself.
I didn't know that.
My mother played golf with her, you know.
She was very fond of her.
It was...
It was the saddest thing to happen in the town that I can remember.
Thank you.
(Nancy) Come on, you two.
And what about the skyscrapers?
Ah, but that's Manhattan.
I live in Brooklyn and I work in Brooklyn, and if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.
All the skyscrapers are across the river.
(Nancy) You don't make it sound very glamorous.
(Eilis) It's not, really.
Not even, what do you call it, the department store where you work?
Oh, Bartocci's?
Well, it sells lovely things.
But I can't afford many of them and I don't like the work, so...
What would you like to do?
I want to do what Rose did.
I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.
Well, you should call in at Davis's.
They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.
I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.
But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.
I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.
You just want her to stay.
(Chuckles)
I'm only thinking of Eilis.
Do you hear that, Eilis?
He's only thinking of you.
(Girls laughing)
(George) That's it, that's it.
Remember, Mrs Grogan didn't notice a thing.
(Laughing continues)
(Nancy) Good night.
(Eilis) Good night.
(George) See you.
(Door closes)
How was your evening?
It was very nice, thank you.
Was that Jim Farrell I saw in the car with them?
It was.
His parents are moving, you know.
They're retiring to the country.
He'll be in that big house on his own.
- Is that right?
- Hmm.
He's a catch for someone.
Good night, Mammy.
- Hello, Eilis.
- Hello, Mrs Brennan.
Quite the star.
- Thank goodness you're back.
- What's the matter?
A lad from Davis's came round.
They have a problem in their accounts department.
They need you up there straightaway.
Is that all?
I'll just put the shopping away.
No, no, leave it.
Straightaway, the young fella said.
It doesn't matter what he said, Mother.
I'm not an employee.
I'd be doing them a favour.
Please, let me do the shopping.
(Maria) The problem is that it's our busy season, so all the mill workers and drivers did overtime last week.
Well, they filled out the overtime slips, but there's been nobody here to work it all out and to add to the wage slips, and some of the men have started to complain, and I can't blame them.
As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.
Well, if you leave me for a couple of hours,
I can work out a system so that whoever comes in after me
- won't have any trouble.
- (Sighs in relief)
Hello, Eilis.
Maria has been telling me you've done the most marvellous job here.
Thank you.
We should have known you would, of course.
You're Rose's sister, after all.
I'm told you have a certificate in book-keeping.
Is it American book-keeping?
I got the certificate in America, but the two systems are very similar.
Well, we'll certainly need someone to deal with wages and so on during the busy season.
So I'd like you to continue on a part-time basis.
Let's see how that goes and then we'll speak again.
I'll be going back to the United States soon.
As I say, let's you and I speak again before we make any firm decisions one way or the other.
Yes, Mr Brown.
Of course.
Thank you.
Now, if you go and see Maria, she'll have your money for today.
(Eilis) I'd forgotten.
What?
This.
(Jim) You have beaches in Brooklyn.
Yes, but they're just very crowded.
There'll probably be quite a few walkers along here later.
Yes.
It's still not the same.
I'm sure it's not.
We don't really know anything of the rest of the world.
We must seem very backward to you now.
Of course not.
You seem calm and civilised and charming.
(Chuckles)
(Nancy) Come on!
My mother wanted you to know that the golf club is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.
A special trophy for the best score by a lady newcomer at the club.
She was always very nice to the newcomers, my mother says.
I hope you're pleased.
Yes.
Of course.
So every year someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?
Yeah, every year, as long as there's a golf club.
And I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.
Yeah, and my mother would like to meet you too, by the way.
(Chuckles)
I'm supposed to arrange a time when you can come around for tea.
Thank you.
I'd like that.
I wish it had been like this before I went.
Before Rose died.
Like what?
There was nothing here for me before and now I have a job and... (Nancy) Here?
Is that an American trick?
Yes.
It's a good one, isn't it?
It's depressing, though, that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?
I mean, how long have they known about it?
A hundred years, probably.
I don't think they had bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.
We still don't have them now.
Well, come on.
You wanna go see the Dodgers on Saturday?
- Sure.
- OK.
- Will you do something for me?
- What?
If you laugh or you say anything about this to anybody in the family, you don't get to go see the Dodgers on Saturday or any other day of the season.
Also you get a beating.
Maybe it's just better if I don't get involved.
I really need your help, Frankie.
You know you're the best writer and reader in the family?
- Yeah.
- I'm trying to write to Eilis.
And I want it to be...
I don't know.
You've wrote before already about five times.
Yeah, but they're no good, Frankie, and...
She's only written back once.
She's never read my writing before.
I'm worried I'm putting her off me.
Listen, I'm eight years old.
I don't know anything about kissing.
You don't need to know anything about kissing.
You need to know about spelling and...
And...
- Grammar.
- Yeah.
Will you look?
(Tony) Dear Eilis.
I hope that you are doing well in Ireland.
I hope that your mother's feeling less sad.
It will not be long before your friend gets married and you can come home.
This week, it's like the whole world's basements are flooding.
I've fixed three.
I've been working hard.
I've been saving money.
Everybody asks me about you all the time.
(Frankie) You missed out an "E," I think.
It's "everybody."
(Tony) Anyway, I think that is all my news.
Mom and Dad and all my brothers, they all say hello.
I think about you most minutes of most days.
Even when I go see the Dodgers,
I do not concentrate on the games.
With love, your Tony.
No hair oil.
And that's not a blazer.
It's a sports jacket.
Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?
- Are you trying to trick me?
- (Chuckles)
No.
I knew what you meant when you said we were all the same.
It made me think that my life must seem very easy to you.
I run my father's bar.
I'm going to live in my parents' house.
I know what that must look like from the outside, but...
It doesn't feel like that.
What does it feel like?
And I've never been anywhere.
I've never even been to England but I'd like to see London and Paris and Rome.
New York.
It frightens me, the idea of dying without ever leaving Ireland.
And there are other things too.
I'm so sorry, I wanted to ask you a thousand things and all I've done is talked.
I'm glad.
- Really?
- Yes.
(Mrs Farrell) Will you finish that wretched pipe and sit with us?
I can hear perfectly well from where I am.
We're not here to provide you with entertainment.
(Mr Farrell) Oh, don't you worry.
I found that out many years ago.
(SCOFFS) Just ignore him, Eilis.
(Whispers) It's as well Jim takes after me, not him.
Speak up.
Are you looking forward to your move?
We'll miss Enniscorthy, but it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.
Mother's worried about leaving me here on me own.
She thinks I'll destroy the place.
Well, I'm hoping you won't be on your own forever.
I'm sure he won't.
I mean...
God, aren't we blessed with this weather?
It's lovely.
(Mr Farrell) The summers in New York are hot, eh?
They can be, yes.
It can get quite humid sometimes.
(Eilis) Dear Tony.
Thank you for your letters.
I want you to know that... (Sighs)
I don't know what I want you to know.
(Sighs heavily)
(Mary) I don't want to be sitting right at the back.
We'll make sure you get the best seats in the house.
But it wouldn't feel right sitting up there with Nancy and George.
We'll find the second best seats in the house, then.
Would you like me to run ahead and save you a couple of places, Mrs Lacey?
Would you mind, Jim?
That'd be grand.
- Such a gentleman, isn't he?
- He is.
Came along at just the right time for us.
(Priest) I invite you now, Nancy, to declare before God and his Church your consent to become George's wife.
I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.
I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.
(Priest) The rings.
Lord, bless these rings.
Grant that those who wear them may always be faithful to each other.
May they do your will and live in peace with you in mutual love.
We ask this through Christ our Lord, amen.
(Both) Amen.
(lndistinct conversations)
Your mother tells me things are working out very well for you in Enniscorthy, Eilis.
It was a lovely service.
And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving out to Glenbrien,
- so Jim'll...
- Yes, I know.
Jim and I promised my mother we'd take her back to the car.
Mmm!
Do you hear that?
"Jim and I. Jim and I."
It won't be long now by the sound of it and your mother will have a wonderful day out.
Will you excuse me?
(Man) There they are.
- Hello, Mrs Byrne.
How are you?
- Jack.
(♪ Jazz)
Can we talk?
What about?
The future.
I can't let you just go back to America without saying anything.
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.
So...
I don't want you to go.
I want you to stay here with me.
And I know that means asking you another question but I don't want to bombard you.
So I'll save that one for later.
Thank you.
I'm grateful.
And I'm flattered.
- That's all?
- No.
No, of course not.
I just...
I'd imagined a different life for myself.
I understand.
But your life here could be just as good.
Better even maybe.
(Car approaching)
Mary.
- I was just coming to fetch you.
- To fetch me?
I haven't worked for Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary.
Please come, Eilis.
She told me not to come back without you.
You know what she's like.
You look after things for five minutes while I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.
There are no customers in there at the moment, so I don't think you can make too much of a mess of things.
So, how have you been getting on?
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.
I heard that you're working over in Davis's, in the accounts department.
That's right.
And there's lots of talk about you and young Jim Farrell.
Oh, well, you know what people are like.
They love to talk.
Yes.
Do you remember Mrs Brady?
She usually comes into the shop on Sunday morning for her rashers.
No?
Well, you have a very busy life now, what with one thing and another.
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece living in Brooklyn.
The world is a small place, isn't it?
She had a letter from her a couple of weeks back.
And what did it say?
Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding at the city hall and her husband bumped into a girl from Enniscorthy who was getting married there.
I'm not sure what you're telling me, Miss Kelly.
He didn't bump into me.
Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.
Although I'm not sure that that's your name any longer, is it?
He couldn't remember.
Something Italian, he thought.
I'd forgotten.
You'd forgotten?
What a thing...
I'd forgotten what this town is like.
What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?
Keep me away from Jim?
Stop me from going back to America?
Perhaps you didn't even know.
My name is Eilis Fiorello.
(Door slams)
(Breathing heavily)
(Phone rings)
- (Operator) Putting you through now.
- Thank you.
(Woman) How can I help?
Hello.
I'd like to make a reservation for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.
I think people spend even more money after a wedding.
Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.
She was buying firelighters in Broom's.
Firelighters in August.
But she'd seen Mrs Stapleton in there and she hadn't had a chance to go through the whole day in detail with her...
Eilis, what's the matter?
Has something happened with Jim?
(Sobbing) Mammy, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm married.
I got married in Brooklyn before I came home.
And I should have told you.
I should have told you as soon as I got back.
I want to be with him.
I want to be with my husband.
Of course.
Is he nice?
Yes.
He'd have to be nice if you married him.
So you're going back?
Yes.
Tomorrow.
Are you on the early train?
I'm going to bed.
Mammy, it's not even 8:00.
You don't have to.
I'm very tired.
And I'd like to say goodbye now.
And only once.
(Sniffles)
Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.
I will.
Good night, Eilis.
(Sniffling)
(Sighs)
So are you away to live in America?
- No.
- Just visiting?
No, I live there already.
Really?
What's it like?
It's a big place.
I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York.
Do you know it?
Yes.
People say that there are so many Irish people there, it's like home.
Is that right?
Yes.
It's just like home.
You're not to eat.
But I might be there years.
No, you can eat when you get there.
Don't eat on the boat.
It'll stop you getting so sick.
Do you promise me?
I promise.
And in a moment I want you to go straight down to your cabin and lock the bathroom door on your side.
When next door starts hammering, you can negotiate.
(Eilis) When you get to immigration, keep your eyes wide open.
Look as if you know where you're going.
You have to think like an American.
You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.
But you will, and it won't kill you.
(Sighs)
(lndistinct conversations)
And one day the sun will come out.
You might not even notice straightaway, it'll be that faint.
And then you'll catch yourself thinking about something or someone who has no connection with the past,
someone who's only yours, and you'll realise that this is where your life is.
(♪ Be Cool Aka Keep Cool)
When the public found out about the excessive lifestyle of the prisoners at La Catedral, the police began an investigation into the supposed capital crimes being committed by Pablo Escobar within the prison walls.
The central part of this investigation involves the disappearance of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.
- Agent Peña?
- What's this?
It's from upstairs.
Oh, I get a card.
Oh, CIA.
"Congratulations, Central Intelligence Agency."
This is, uh... this is blowing up a little bit more than we expected, no?
Well, hopefully, the son of a bitch rots in jail.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We gotta transfer him first.
- I forbade you to leak this.
- How do you know it was us?
- Escobar has a lot of enemies.
- 'Course it was you.
Whoever did this, it doesn't really matter now.
What's done is done.
Ambassador, like you said, this is a Colombian matter.
What do we care?
I'm filing a report with the Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.
- Ambassador...
- Good, report to Washington.
'Cause if something isn't done, every American down here associated with the government is gonna look like a fool, including you.
I wasn't finished.
Until further notice, you're both suspended.
Go home.
MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?
Mr. President, I just spoke with the attorney general.
Moncada's wife reported his disappearance from La Catedral.
It's clear that Escobar killed those men in that prison.
- I don't think he'd take it that far.
- Escobar is capable of anything.
But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.
Forgive me, Eduardo... but I'm having a hard time finding the silver lining in all this.
This is our opportunity to end Pablo's vacation.
- Boss.
- Good morning, boss.
Ahh!
Good morning, boss.
Bad news.
Have the bodies disappeared?
Our agreement with him states he can't be moved to another prison.
Excuse me, but killing people in prison is a direct violation of our agreement.
Yes, yes, but we have to tread carefully.
If he feels we're violating his terms, he'll start putting bombs on street corners again.
Let's tell him we've uncovered threats against him from his biggest enemies.
That would give us the opportunity to bring him to Bogotá while we improve security at La Catedral.
The fourth brigade, commanded by General Ariza, would be the best choice to carry out this operation.
- Ariza?
- Yes, sir.
- Is he from Medellín?
- Yes, sir.
Hm.
Can we trust him?
Yes, sir.
Success.
Sure, it cost me a suspension, but who cares?
I just call it a week's paternity leave.
I was ready to crack a beer and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.
See, because of me and Peña, the Colombian government was sending in the army.
Not the cops, but the fucking army.
There was no way that Escobar was getting out of this one.
But, then again, in Colombia... nothing goes down the way you think it will.
I'm calling him.
Don Pablo, here...
Tata's on the phone.
I was just thinking there's nothing in the world I'd love more than to hear my wife's lovely voice.
Pablo, what's happening?
Why would something be happening here?
The soldiers.
Soldiers?
Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.
I don't know, Pablo.
Tell me what's happening.
No, my love, it's nothing.
Everything is cool.
I'll call back soon, all right?
I love you, baby.
Yes, my love.
Get out the weapons.
As you wish, sir.
Listen up, company!
You will be under the command of Lieutenant Dominguez.
Let's secure the perimeter.
Tell your men they have orders to shoot anyone
- trying to leave the prison, understood?
- As you wish, General.
Dismissed.
- Juan Pablo, where are you going?
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.
- No, dear, you can't go there now.
- I said I want to go!
- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.
- He needs you to stay here to look after your sister.
Isn't that what he always says?
- But the soldiers are going to kill him.
- Don't ever say that in this house!
- They're going to kill him!
- Quiet!
The car was outside the garage, still idling, the keys still in the ignition.
- I've called his phone 20 times.
- Did you call embassy security?
- No, I wanted to talk to you first.
- Good.
Don't.
What?
Why not?
Nothing.
I just...
I don't wanna ring any alarms before I check things out.
- What are you guys up to?
- Connie...
Just try to relax, OK?
I'm sure everything's fine.
I'm gonna take care of this.
I'll find out where he is, all right?
Look, I'll make you a drink.
Boss... they're gonna try to take you out of here and look for evidence on Moncada and Galeano.
If I leave this place, someone will kill me.
Or the Americans will use their power to restore extradition and send me to the US.
What the fuck, let's give those bastards lead.
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.
For every one of our men, they have 20!
- Let's do it now.
- Don't be an idiot.
Wait for the boss!
Stop bickering in front of the boss.
We have the escape routes.
We could get into the hills before they even know we're gone.
There is a time to fight... and there is a time to be clever.
Yes, sir.
- What's your plan?
- Let's talk to Gaviria.
Be smart.
Try to settle this matter peacefully.
If that fails?
What are you doing back here?
- I forgot my socks.
- I want you out in five minutes.
Son of a bitch.
These Colombians are knee-deep in a shit storm.
We gotta talk.
Back here.
What?
You get a hooker pregnant?
I think Agent Murphy got snatched.
I checked all area hospitals, police stations.
We were pursuing leads on the Cali cartel.
It could be related to that, or it could be Escobar.
Did you report it to the Regional Security Office?
If I tell the ROS, it becomes a five-alarm fire, and whoever has him might panic.
If it is Escobar, he's dead already.
Well, can you check your sources?
See what comes up?
Jesus Christ.
Let me see what I can do.
General Ariza has orders to secure Escobar.
I want you to go there and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.
- What do you mean, "legalize" it?
- Formalize it.
You'll reiterate that this is a temporary relocation while we renovate La Catedral to make it safer for him.
We both know that's not true.
But it's what you'll tell Escobar until he's safely inside a military brig.
Yes, Mr. President.
What's wrong?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Eduardo, I trust you... and this is too important to leave to someone I don't trust completely.
I'm at your service, Mr. President.
You know that very well.
Nothing will make me happier than to see that asshole get the justice he deserves.
Checked my sources with the Colombian military.
Nobody knows jack shit.
So no indication Escobar had anything to do with Murphy's disappearance?
It's time to sound the alarm.
Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?
We call out the troops, he ends up dead like Diana Turbay.
Thanks.
Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet until further notice, understand?
All right.
What else do you have?
- I know that.
- Velasco.
I'll call you back.
Yes, boss?
What's happening outside?
We don't know.
I fucked up.
What's that, boss?
Gather the boys.
And tell the prison guards they're to fire on anyone who tries to come in.
Boss, do you think the prison guards will follow your orders?
They'd better.
I hired them.
Excuse me.
Boss, the people from Medellín just informed me that some guy named Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.
Mm.
Good evening.
Where is General Ariza?
General!
Let him through.
Good evening, General.
- Mr. Vice Minister.
- How are you?
Pleasure to see you.
Good evening.
- Where's Escobar?
- Escobar?
Inside the prison, obviously.
What do you mean, he's in the prison?
I thought you were taking him into custody when you arrived.
I'm sorry, sir, but those were not my orders.
Then what were your orders?
My orders were to secure the perimeter, not let anyone in or out, and wait for you.
That's not what the president believes.
He's not going to be happy to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.
I'm sorry, but those were my orders.
I turned myself in to that punk...
the vice minister of justice.
But since there is no justice in this country, he is the vice minister of nothing.
This is good.
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.
This is very good.
General, I don't believe you understand your orders clearly.
- But I do.
- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?
I'm going to try to make a miracle happen.
I'm going in there to convince Escobar this is a temporary transfer of location.
And I'm also going to say that I'm here to guarantee his safety.
I can't allow you to put yourself in danger.
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough to kill the vice minister of justice right in front of the fourth brigade?
For God's sake.
At least let me make a call so they don't shoot you when you walk in!
Make it fast.
Open the door.
You two are coming with me.
Didn't you hear me?
Open the door!
General!
Listen to the vice minister!
Hurry up!
Open it.
Vice Minister, good evening.
Pablo is waiting for you.
Go on.
Wait here.
Good evening, Vice Minister.
It's been a while.
Good evening.
I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.
My orders are to escort you to a temporary prison in Bogotá.
The government has decided to make some improvements here at La Catedral for your safety and everyone else's here.
Mm.
I would think Gaviria could come up with a more believable lie.
I know why you're here.
Because of Moncada and Galeano.
But I didn't kill those men.
That story is a lie.
And why should the government care about some dispute between gangsters?
We don't care about that.
You're mistaken.
You are betraying me, Vice Minister.
Gaviria is betraying me.
If your safety is a concern, I will gladly escort you out myself.
We have an agreement, and you're breaking it.
What guarantee do I have that the Americans won't kidnap me and take me to the US?
Bush would be very happy to stick me in a gringo jail, like he did to Lehder, like he did to Noriega, right?
That's not gonna happen, you have my word.
- Your word.
- Mm.
As vice minister of justice?
Yes.
I give you my word as vice minister of justice.
Haven't you noticed that the army has completely surrounded this jail?
We can end this peacefully... if you just cooperate and walk out with me.
Don Pablo, these bastards will kill you!
I respectfully decline your offer, Vice Minister.
The press is saying I killed those men, but that's a lie to sell newspapers.
If Gaviria wants me out of here... he can come here...
and do it himself.
Meanwhile...
I'll view any incursion as a declaration of war.
I'll inform the president of your position.
Excuse me.
Mr. Vice Minister.
Why walk all that way when I have a telephone in my office?
I'd rather call the president from outside the prison, thanks.
Let me out!
Surely your mother taught you never to turn down a polite invitation.
My mother taught me an invitation is optional.
I hope you'll forgive me for making this invitation mandatory.
It's not every day we're honored with the presence of a vice minister of justice.
Come on, Vice Minister.
Calm down, let's go.
Where have you been?
You don't even answer your phone?
Sorry, I've, uh...
I've been working on it.
What the fuck does that mean?
Doing what?
I'm sorry.
Just trying to hold it together.
God, I just wanna go home.
I want my husband back.
- Do you think he's alive, Javi?
- Yeah.
No.
You're just not sure he's dead.
What's taking this guy so long?
General, with all due respect,
I don't think we should've let him go inside.
No.
I don't think Pablo is stupid enough to fuck with the vice minister.
Can I get you something to drink?
I don't need anything.
Look, don't be so nervous.
As soon as you have the president on the phone, you will make it clear that if he doesn't remove the troops surrounding the prison immediately, there will be grave consequences.
But if he withdraws the troops, we'll stay here quietly and complete our sentence.
Good evening, President Gaviria's office.
It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice.
I need to talk to the president.
One minute, please.
Mr. President, excuse the interruption.
There is a call from Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.
- Thank you, María.
- Excuse me.
Hello?
Hello?
How long will I be here as a hostage?
You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.
Escobar has Sandoval inside the prison.
Hang up right now, Mr. President.
- Hang up, please.
- I need to know if he's OK.
Mr. President, hang up the phone.
If Escobar knows you're on the line, he might force you to strike a bargain.
Or worse, if you lie to him, he might kill Eduardo.
Hang up the phone.
Sir!
Leave us alone.
- They hung up.
- Bullshit.
Shut up!
So, then... the president is too busy to speak with me.
I don't understand how he ended up in that jail.
Me, either.
I don't know what Sandoval is doing.
What did he think, that he could convince Escobar he was there to help him?
We agreed that Ariza would have Escobar in custody.
Ariza must've had his reasons for holding off.
- Right.
- This is a very delicate situation.
You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.
Please, I suggest we call DAS to bring in a hostage negotiation team.
Do I have your permission?
Good.
María Clara, connect me with DAS, immediately.
- No.
No.
- Cancel the call.
- This time, we will not negotiate.
- I don't understand, Mr. President.
If Sandoval dies...
I will have it on my conscience for the rest of my life.
But my country comes first, and I will not empower Escobar.
Send in the Special Forces...
and finish this, once and for all.
I just realized something.
The president didn't just betray me... he also betrayed you.
He knew if you came here...
Look at me.
There would be three options.
I leave with you, peacefully.
I take you hostage.
I shoot you, and then, he really would have a good excuse to kill me.
Right?
Either way, he wins.
Right?
Maybe the president is betraying us both.
You could be right.
But you know something?
I'll sacrifice my life to make sure you're dead.
You think you're better than me, but you're wrong.
I come from nothing.
I fought hard to become what I am.
If the government hadn't come after me...
I would be where you are now...
the vice minister of justice.
You and I are nothing alike.
You are a criminal.
And criminals can't run forever.
Sir.
Your friend Gaviria has ordered Special Forces to raid the prison while you're still inside.
I would have done the same thing.
Don't kill him.
If he dies... it will be at the hands of his own government.
Good luck, Vice Minister.
Now what?
I'm sorry, Ambassador.
We have a situation.
Damn right we do.
Hey, partner.
Remember how I told you that no one in their right mind would ever kill a DEA agent?
Well, to be honest, after they snatched me,
I'd forgotten that, myself.
But then, I calmed down and realized that if they wanted to kill me, they would've blown my brains out right in front of my house.
This... was something different.
I figured this was Escobar knowing that they were coming to get him, and grabbing me.
Sit.
Man, you fucked up.
You think that they're gonna make a trade for me?
No.
No!
They're gonna storm that bullshit fuckin' prison and blow his fuckin' head off!
I'm sorry you were taken against your will, but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly, given your last meeting with Navegante.
Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see your Cali cartel is doing so well, but you've made a huge mistake.
I don't see it that way.
I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking the liberty of making you a cocktail.
I just learned how to do a really interesting passion fruit daiquiri.
That's wonderful, but I don't want your fuckin' daiquiri.
You're free to leave anytime.
We are a long way from Bogotá.
Fine.
I'm leaving.
I'll show myself out.
I thought you might like to see some pictures I have.
Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo to ID a location where Pablo's sicarios were gathering.
Two hours later, they were dead.
Along with an innocent woman.
OK.
Poison will be at La Dispensaria at around midnight with his crew.
Who's your contact at the embassy?
Did you know she had two kids?
What do you think our newspapers will think of that?
Our government doesn't take too kindly to American-backed death squads.
I could blackmail you with these pictures.
You'd lose your career at the DEA, go to jail...
maybe here in Colombia.
But don't worry.
I won't ask you or Javier Peña to cross any line you haven't already crossed.
So you think the DEA and Cali cartel would be a good match.
There are many, in every segment of Colombia, who have been persecuted by Pablo Escobar.
The families of Moncada and Galeano, the families of judges and police... people with resources who need to be unified.
They want vengeance.
- And you'll help them get it?
- With your help.
I can't make any commitments right now.
But I can tell you this:
When Pablo goes down, and he will go down... you'll hear a knock at your door, and it'll be me.
You haven't tried my daiquiri.
That Herrera's a pretty good host.
Makes a mean cocktail, gives you door-to-door service right to the embassy.
- What did Herrera say?
- What'd he say?
What'd he say?
You fuckin' gave him that information.
He's got pictures on me, he's got tape on me, Javi.
Answer me.
- What?
- Did you give that shit to Herrera?
- Do you think I would do that to you?
- Are you playing with Cali, Javi?
That your version of "all in"?
Get Escobar.
That's not an answer.
Who gave him the fucking photos?
Hey.
See you around, Jav.
I'm gonna go call my wife.
Sir, I have her on the line.
- Hello, my love.
- Hello.
Look, we're having a little problem here.
We're trying to solve it, but you know what to do... if it doesn't work out, right?
Yes, Pablo.
I love you very much.
Me, too.
- Very much.
- Goodbye, my love.
We are bandits.
- Wait a minute!
What is this?
- Your brigade is no longer in charge!
You've gotta get me out of here, do you understand?
Come on, come on.
- Hurry up!
- Get down!
No!
Get in there!
Don't move, don't move!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- Don't move!
Don't move!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.
Keep low, and no matter what happens, keep moving.
Speak.
Yes, it's him.
Speak up, please, I can't hear you.
Is that confirmed?
Wait a minute.
Mr. President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval's been freed.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
And Escobar?
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
Look what we found.
Do you think he's OK?
I'm sure he's fine.
See you tomorrow.
Good night.
It's OK... it's OK.
It's OK.
Steve...
I just wanna go home.
This is home.
Less than an hour after Escobar escaped La Catedral, word had spread all over Colombia that war was coming again.
But this time would be different.
This time, there would be no surrender... no negotiations... no deals.
This time...
we were gonna kill him.
Escobar said, "Better a grave in Colombia than a cell in the US."
Well, guess what, motherfucker?
That works for me.
(reporter in Spanish) When the public found out about the excessive lifestyle of the prisoners at La Catedral, the police began an investigation into the supposed capital crimes being committed by Pablo Escobar within the prison walls.
The central part of this investigation involves the disappearance of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.
(cheering)
- (in English) Agent Peña?
- What's this?
It's from upstairs.
Oh, I get a card.
Oh, CIA.
"Congratulations, Central Intelligence Agency."
This is, uh... this is blowing up a little bit more than we expected, no?
Well, hopefully, the son of a bitch rots in jail.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We gotta transfer him first.
- (Noonan) I forbade you to leak this.
- (Javier) How do you know it was us?
- Escobar has a lot of enemies.
- 'Course it was you.
Whoever did this, it doesn't really matter now.
What's done is done.
Ambassador, like you said, this is a Colombian matter.
What do we care?
I'm filing a report with the Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.
- Ambassador--
- Good, report to Washington.
'Cause if something isn't done, every American down here associated with the government is gonna look like a fool, including you.
I wasn't finished.
Until further notice, you're both suspended.
Go home.
MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?
(in Spanish) Mr. President, I just spoke with the attorney general.
Moncada's wife reported his disappearance from La Catedral.
It's clear that Escobar killed those men in that prison.
- I don't think he'd take it that far.
- Escobar is capable of anything.
But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.
Forgive me, Eduardo... but I'm having a hard time finding the silver lining in all this.
This is our opportunity to end Pablo's vacation.
(sighs)
(upbeat Latin song plays)
- (man in Spanish) Boss.
- Good morning, boss.
(low greetings in Spanish)
(indistinct chatter)
(sniffing)
Ahh!
Good morning, boss.
Bad news.
Have the bodies disappeared?
(low murmurs)
(in Spanish) Our agreement with him states he can't be moved to another prison.
Excuse me, but killing people in prison is a direct violation of our agreement.
Yes, yes, but we have to tread carefully.
If he feels we're violating his terms, he'll start putting bombs on street corners again.
Let's tell him we've uncovered threats against him from his biggest enemies.
That would give us the opportunity to bring him to Bogotá while we improve security at La Catedral.
The fourth brigade, commanded by General Ariza, would be the best choice to carry out this operation.
- Ariza?
- Yes, sir.
- Is he from Medellín?
- Yes, sir.
Hm.
Can we trust him?
Yes, sir.
(Steve) Success.
Sure, it cost me a suspension, but who cares?
I just call it a week's paternity leave.
I was ready to crack a beer and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.
See, because of me and Peña, the Colombian government was sending in the army.
Not the cops, but the fucking army.
There was no way that Escobar was getting out of this one.
But, then again, in Colombia... nothing goes down the way you think it will.
(grunting)
(in Spanish) I'm calling him.
Don Pablo, here...
Tata's on the phone.
I was just thinking there's nothing in the world I'd love more than to hear my wife's lovely voice.
Pablo, what's happening?
Why would something be happening here?
The soldiers.
Soldiers?
Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.
I don't know, Pablo.
Tell me what's happening.
No, my love, it's nothing.
Everything is cool.
I'll call back soon, all right?
I love you, baby.
Yes, my love.
Get out the weapons.
As you wish, sir.
(shouting orders in Spanish)
(overlapping shouts in Spanish)
(indistinct chatter)
Listen up, company!
You will be under the command of Lieutenant Dominguez.
Let's secure the perimeter.
Tell your men they have orders to shoot anyone
- trying to leave the prison, understood?
- (man) As you wish, General.
Dismissed.
- Juan Pablo, where are you going?
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.
- No, dear, you can't go there now.
- I said I want to go!
- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.
- He needs you to stay here to look after your sister.
Isn't that what he always says?
- But the soldiers are going to kill him.
- Don't ever say that in this house!
- They're going to kill him!
- Quiet!
(Connie in English) The car was outside the garage, still idling, the keys still in the ignition.
- I've called his phone 20 times.
- Did you call embassy security?
- No, I wanted to talk to you first.
- Good.
Don't.
What?
Why not?
Nothing.
I just...
I don't wanna ring any alarms before I check things out.
- What are you guys up to?
- Connie...
Just try to relax, OK?
I'm sure everything's fine.
- (scoffs)
- I'm gonna take care of this.
- I'll find out where he is, all right?
- (baby whimpers, sobs)
- (sighs)
- Look, I'll make you a drink.
(news chatter in Spanish over radio)
(in Spanish) Boss... they're gonna try to take you out of here and look for evidence on Moncada and Galeano.
If I leave this place, someone will kill me.
Or the Americans will use their power to restore extradition and send me to the US.
What the fuck, let's give those bastards lead.
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.
For every one of our men, they have 20!
- Let's do it now.
- Don't be an idiot.
Wait for the boss!
Stop bickering in front of the boss.
We have the escape routes.
We could get into the hills before they even know we're gone.
There is a time to fight... and there is a time to be clever.
Yes, sir.
- What's your plan?
- Let's talk to Gaviria.
Be smart.
Try to settle this matter peacefully.
If that fails?
(in English) What are you doing back here?
- I forgot my socks.
- (Noonan) I want you out in five minutes.
Son of a bitch.
These Colombians are knee-deep in a shit storm.
We gotta talk.
Back here.
What?
You get a hooker pregnant?
I think Agent Murphy got snatched.
I checked all area hospitals, police stations.
We were pursuing leads on the Cali cartel.
It could be related to that, or it could be Escobar.
Did you report it to the Regional Security Office?
If I tell the ROS, it becomes a five-alarm fire, and whoever has him might panic.
If it is Escobar, he's dead already.
Well, can you check your sources?
See what comes up?
(scoffs)
Jesus Christ.
Let me see what I can do.
(in Spanish) General Ariza has orders to secure Escobar.
I want you to go there and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.
- What do you mean, "legalize" it?
- Formalize it.
You'll reiterate that this is a temporary relocation while we renovate La Catedral to make it safer for him.
We both know that's not true.
But it's what you'll tell Escobar until he's safely inside a military brig.
Yes, Mr. President.
What's wrong?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Eduardo, I trust you... and this is too important to leave to someone I don't trust completely.
I'm at your service, Mr. President.
You know that very well.
Nothing will make me happier than to see that asshole get the justice he deserves.
(knock on window)
Checked my sources with the Colombian military.
Nobody knows jack shit.
So no indication Escobar had anything to do with Murphy's disappearance?
It's time to sound the alarm.
Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?
We call out the troops, he ends up dead like Diana Turbay.
- (starts engine)
- Thanks.
(helicopters circling)
(Velasco in Spanish) Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet until further notice, understand?
All right.
What else do you have?
- I know that.
- Velasco.
I'll call you back.
Yes, boss?
What's happening outside?
We don't know.
(sighs)
(whispers) I fucked up.
(Velasco) What's that, boss?
Gather the boys.
And tell the prison guards they're to fire on anyone who tries to come in.
Boss, do you think the prison guards will follow your orders?
They'd better.
I hired them.
Excuse me.
Boss, the people from Medellín just informed me that some guy named Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.

the vice minister of justice.
But since there is no justice in this country, he is the vice minister of nothing.
This is good.
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.
(softly) This is very good.
General, I don't believe you understand your orders clearly.

- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?
I'm going to try to make a miracle happen.
I'm going in there to convince Escobar this is a temporary transfer of location.

I can't allow you to put yourself in danger.
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough to kill the vice minister of justice right in front of the fourth brigade?

Make it fast.
Open the door.
You two are coming with me.

But my country comes first, and I will not empower Escobar.
Send in the Special Forces...
and finish this, once and for all.
(Pablo) I just realized something.
The president didn't just betray me... he also betrayed you.
He knew if you came here...
Look at me.
...there would be three options.
One:
I leave with you, peacefully.
Two:
I take you hostage.
Three:
I shoot you, and then, he really would have a good excuse to kill me.
Right?
(Pablo sighs)
Either way, he wins.
Right?
Maybe the president is betraying us both.
You could be right.
But you know something?
I'll sacrifice my life to make sure you're dead.
You think you're better than me, but you're wrong.
I come from nothing.
I fought hard to become what I am.
If the government hadn't come after me...
I would be where you are now...
the vice minister of justice.
You and I are nothing alike.
You are a criminal.
And criminals can't run forever.
(Velasco) Sir.
(whispers indistinctly)
Your friend Gaviria has ordered Special Forces to raid the prison while you're still inside.
I would have done the same thing.
Don't kill him.
If he dies... it will be at the hands of his own government.
Good luck, Vice Minister.
(overlapping chatter)
(sighs)
(in English) Now what?
I'm sorry, Ambassador.
We have a situation.
(Noonan) Damn right we do.
Hey, partner.
(Steve) Remember how I told you that no one in their right mind would ever kill a DEA agent?
Well, to be honest, after they snatched me,
I'd forgotten that, myself.
But then, I calmed down and realized that if they wanted to kill me, they would've blown my brains out right in front of my house.
- This... was something different.
- (opera music playing)
I figured this was Escobar knowing that they were coming to get him, and grabbing a get-out-of-jail-free card: me.
(in English) Sit.
(Steve) Man, you fucked up.
You think that they're gonna make a trade for me?
No.
No!
They're gonna storm that bullshit fuckin' prison and blow his fuckin' head off!
(in English) I'm sorry you were taken against your will, but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly, given your last meeting with Navegante.
(music stops)
Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see your Cali cartel is doing so well, but you've made a huge mistake.
I don't see it that way.
I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking the liberty of making you a cocktail.
I just learned how to do a really interesting passion fruit daiquiri.
That's wonderful, but I don't want your fuckin' daiquiri.
You're free to leave anytime.
We are a long way from Bogotá.
Fine.
I'm leaving.
I'll show myself out.
(Pacho) I thought you might like to see some pictures I have.
Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo to ID a location where Pablo's sicarios were gathering.
Two hours later, they were dead.
Along with an innocent woman.
OK.
(Steve on recording) Poison will be at La Dispensaria at around midnight with his crew.
(scoffs)
Who's your contact at the embassy?
Did you know she had two kids?
What do you think our newspapers will think of that?
Our government doesn't take too kindly to American-backed death squads.
I could blackmail you with these pictures.
You'd lose your career at the DEA, go to jail...
maybe here in Colombia.
But don't worry.
I won't ask you or Javier Peña to cross any line you haven't already crossed.
So you think the DEA and Cali cartel would be a good match.
There are many, in every segment of Colombia, who have been persecuted by Pablo Escobar.
The families of Moncada and Galeano, the families of judges and police... people with resources who need to be unified.
They want vengeance.
- And you'll help them get it?
- With your help.
I can't make any commitments right now.
But I can tell you this:
When Pablo goes down, and he will go down... you'll hear a knock at your door, and it'll be me.
You haven't tried my daiquiri.
That Herrera's a pretty good host.
Makes a mean cocktail, gives you door-to-door service right to the embassy.
- What did Herrera say?
- What'd he say?
What'd he say?
(softly) You fuckin' gave him that information.
He's got pictures on me, he's got tape on me, Javi.
Answer me.
- (softly) What?
- Did you give that shit to Herrera?
- Do you think I would do that to you?
- Are you playing with Cali, Javi?
That your version of "all in"?
I got one goal: get Escobar.
That's not an answer.
Who gave him the fucking photos?
Hey.
See you around, Jav.
I'm gonna go call my wife.
(hushed chatter in Spanish)
(in Spanish) Sir, I have her on the line.
- Hello, my love.
- (Tata) Hello.
Look, we're having a little problem here.
We're trying to solve it, but you know what to do... if it doesn't work out, right?
Yes, Pablo.
I love you very much.
Me, too.
- Very much.
- Goodbye, my love.
(indistinct whispers in Spanish)
We are bandits.
(low murmurs)
(loud explosion)
(indistinct shouts)
- Wait a minute!
What is this?
- Your brigade is no longer in charge!
(shouting indistinctly in Spanish)
- (automatic gunfire) - (shouts in Spanish)
You've gotta get me out of here, do you understand?
Come on, come on.
- (groans) - (indistinct shouts)
(indistinct shouts)
(alarm wailing)
- (gunfire) - (indistinct chatter)
- (man) Hurry up!
- Get down!
No!
Get in there!
(overlapping shouts)
(grunts)
(automatic gunfire)
(whimpering)
Don't move, don't move!
(automatic gunfire)
(grenade rolling)
(automatic gunfire)
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
(man grunts)
- (gunfire) - (man groans)
- Don't move!
Don't move!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.
Keep low, and no matter what happens, keep moving.
(indistinct shouts in Spanish)
(phone rings)
Speak.
Yes, it's him.
Speak up, please, I can't hear you.
Is that confirmed?
Wait a minute. (sighs)
Mr. President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval's been freed.
(excited chatter)
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
And Escobar?
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
(overlapping chatter in Spanish)
(man) Look what we found.
Do you think he's OK?
I'm sure he's fine.
(man in Spanish) See you tomorrow.
Good night.
(in English) It's OK... it's OK.
It's OK.
Steve...
I just wanna go home.
This is home.
(sharp breath)
(Steve) Less than an hour after Escobar escaped La Catedral, word had spread all over Colombia that war was coming again.
But this time would be different.
This time, there would be no surrender... no negotiations... no deals.
This time...
we were gonna kill him.
Escobar said, "Better a grave in Colombia than a cell in the US."
Well, guess what, motherfucker?
That works for me.
When the public found out about the excessive lifestyle of the prisoners at La Catedral, the police began an investigation into the supposed capital crimes being committed by Pablo Escobar within the prison walls.
The central part of this investigation involves the disappearance of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.
- Agent Peña?
- What's this?
It's from upstairs.
Oh, I get a card.
Oh, CIA.
"Congratulations, Central Intelligence Agency."
This is, uh... this is blowing up a little bit more than we expected, no?
Well, hopefully, the son of a bitch rots in jail.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We gotta transfer him first.
- I forbade you to leak this.
- How do you know it was us?
- Escobar has a lot of enemies.
- 'Course it was you.
Whoever did this, it doesn't really matter now.
What's done is done.
Ambassador, like you said, this is a Colombian matter.
What do we care?
I'm filing a report with the Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.
- Ambassador--
- Good, report to Washington.
'Cause if something isn't done, every American down here associated with the government is gonna look like a fool, including you.
I wasn't finished.
Until further notice, you're both suspended.
Go home.
MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?
Mr. President, I just spoke with the attorney general.
Moncada's wife reported his disappearance from La Catedral.
It's clear that Escobar killed those men in that prison.
- I don't think he'd take it that far.
- Escobar is capable of anything.
But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.
Forgive me, Eduardo... but I'm having a hard time finding the silver lining in all this.
This is our opportunity to end Pablo's vacation.
- Boss.
- Good morning, boss.
Ahh!
Good morning, boss.
Bad news.
Have the bodies disappeared?
Our agreement with him states he can't be moved to another prison.
Excuse me, but killing people in prison is a direct violation of our agreement.
Yes, yes, but we have to tread carefully.
If he feels we're violating his terms, he'll start putting bombs on street corners again.
Let's tell him we've uncovered threats against him from his biggest enemies.
That would give us the opportunity to bring him to Bogotá while we improve security at La Catedral.
The fourth brigade, commanded by General Ariza, would be the best choice to carry out this operation.
- Ariza?
- Yes, sir.
- Is he from Medellín?
- Yes, sir.
Hm.
Can we trust him?
Yes, sir.
Success.
Sure, it cost me a suspension, but who cares?
I just call it a week's paternity leave.
I was ready to crack a beer and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.
See, because of me and Peña, the Colombian government was sending in the army.
Not the cops, but the fucking army.
There was no way that Escobar was getting out of this one.
But, then again, in Colombia... nothing goes down the way you think it will.
I'm calling him.
Don Pablo, here...
Tata's on the phone.
I was just thinking there's nothing in the world I'd love more than to hear my wife's lovely voice.
Pablo, what's happening?
Why would something be happening here?
The soldiers.
Soldiers?
Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.
I don't know, Pablo.
Tell me what's happening.
No, my love, it's nothing.
Everything is cool.
I'll call back soon, all right?
I love you, baby.
Yes, my love.
Get out the weapons.
As you wish, sir.
Listen up, company!
You will be under the command of Lieutenant Dominguez.
Let's secure the perimeter.
Tell your men they have orders to shoot anyone
- trying to leave the prison, understood?
- As you wish, General.
Dismissed.
- Juan Pablo, where are you going?
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.
- No, dear, you can't go there now.
- I said I want to go!
- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.
- He needs you to stay here to look after your sister.
Isn't that what he always says?
- But the soldiers are going to kill him.
- Don't ever say that in this house!
- They're going to kill him!
- Quiet!
The car was outside the garage, still idling, the keys still in the ignition.
- I've called his phone 20 times.
- Did you call embassy security?
- No, I wanted to talk to you first.
- Good.
Don't.
What?
Why not?
Nothing.
I just...
I don't wanna ring any alarms before I check things out.
- What are you guys up to?
- Connie...
Just try to relax, OK?
I'm sure everything's fine.
- I'm gonna take care of this.
- I'll find out where he is, all right?
- Look, I'll make you a drink.
Boss... they're gonna try to take you out of here and look for evidence on Moncada and Galeano.
If I leave this place, someone will kill me.
Or the Americans will use their power to restore extradition and send me to the US.
What the fuck, let's give those bastards lead.
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.
For every one of our men, they have 20!
- Let's do it now.
- Don't be an idiot.
Wait for the boss!
Stop bickering in front of the boss.
We have the escape routes.
We could get into the hills before they even know we're gone.
There is a time to fight... and there is a time to be clever.
Yes, sir.
- What's your plan?
- Let's talk to Gaviria.
Be smart.
Try to settle this matter peacefully.
If that fails?
What are you doing back here?
- I forgot my socks.
- I want you out in five minutes.
Son of a bitch.
These Colombians are knee-deep in a shit storm.
We gotta talk.
Back here.
What?
You get a hooker pregnant?
I think Agent Murphy got snatched.
I checked all area hospitals, police stations.
We were pursuing leads on the Cali cartel.
It could be related to that, or it could be Escobar.
Did you report it to the Regional Security Office?
If I tell the ROS, it becomes a five-alarm fire, and whoever has him might panic.
If it is Escobar, he's dead already.
Well, can you check your sources?
See what comes up?
Jesus Christ.
Let me see what I can do.
General Ariza has orders to secure Escobar.
I want you to go there and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.
- What do you mean, "legalize" it?
- Formalize it.
You'll reiterate that this is a temporary relocation while we renovate La Catedral to make it safer for him.
We both know that's not true.
But it's what you'll tell Escobar until he's safely inside a military brig.
Yes, Mr. President.
What's wrong?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Eduardo, I trust you... and this is too important to leave to someone I don't trust completely.
I'm at your service, Mr. President.
You know that very well.
Nothing will make me happier than to see that asshole get the justice he deserves.
Checked my sources with the Colombian military.
Nobody knows jack shit.
So no indication Escobar had anything to do with Murphy's disappearance?
It's time to sound the alarm.
Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?
We call out the troops, he ends up dead like Diana Turbay.
- Thanks.
Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet until further notice, understand?
All right.
What else do you have?
- I know that.
- Velasco.
I'll call you back.
Yes, boss?
What's happening outside?
We don't know.
I fucked up.
What's that, boss?
Gather the boys.
And tell the prison guards they're to fire on anyone who tries to come in.
Boss, do you think the prison guards will follow your orders?
They'd better.
I hired them.
Excuse me.
Boss, the people from Medellín just informed me that some guy named Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.
Mm.
Good evening.
Where is General Ariza?
General!
Let him through.
Good evening, General.
- Mr. Vice Minister.
- How are you?
Pleasure to see you.
Good evening.
- Where's Escobar?
- Escobar?
Inside the prison, obviously.
What do you mean, he's in the prison?
I thought you were taking him into custody when you arrived.
I'm sorry, sir, but those were not my orders.
Then what were your orders?
My orders were to secure the perimeter, not let anyone in or out, and wait for you.
That's not what the president believes.
He's not going to be happy to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.
I'm sorry, but those were my orders.
I turned myself in to that punk...
the vice minister of justice.
But since there is no justice in this country, he is the vice minister of nothing.
This is good.
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.
This is very good.
General, I don't believe you understand your orders clearly.
- But I do.
- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?
I'm going to try to make a miracle happen.
I'm going in there to convince Escobar this is a temporary transfer of location.
And I'm also going to say that I'm here to guarantee his safety.
I can't allow you to put yourself in danger.
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough to kill the vice minister of justice right in front of the fourth brigade?
For God's sake.
At least let me make a call so they don't shoot you when you walk in!
Make it fast.
Open the door.
You two are coming with me.
Didn't you hear me?
Open the door!
General!
Listen to the vice minister!
Hurry up!
Open it.
Vice Minister, good evening.
Pablo is waiting for you.
Go on.
Wait here.
Good evening, Vice Minister.
It's been a while.
Good evening.
I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.
My orders are to escort you to a temporary prison in Bogotá.
The government has decided to make some improvements here at La Catedral for your safety and everyone else's here.
Mm.
I would think Gaviria could come up with a more believable lie.
I know why you're here.
Because of Moncada and Galeano.
But I didn't kill those men.
That story is a lie.
And why should the government care about some dispute between gangsters?
We don't care about that.
You're mistaken.
You are betraying me, Vice Minister.
Gaviria is betraying me.
If your safety is a concern, I will gladly escort you out myself.
We have an agreement, and you're breaking it.
What guarantee do I have that the Americans won't kidnap me and take me to the US?
Bush would be very happy to stick me in a gringo jail, like he did to Lehder, like he did to Noriega, right?
That's not gonna happen, you have my word.
- Your word.
- Mm.
As vice minister of justice?
Yes.
I give you my word as vice minister of justice.
Haven't you noticed that the army has completely surrounded this jail?
We can end this peacefully... if you just cooperate and walk out with me.
Don Pablo, these bastards will kill you!
I respectfully decline your offer, Vice Minister.
The press is saying I killed those men, but that's a lie to sell newspapers.
If Gaviria wants me out of here... he can come here...
and do it himself.
Meanwhile...
I'll view any incursion as a declaration of war.
I'll inform the president of your position.
Excuse me.
Mr. Vice Minister.
Why walk all that way when I have a telephone in my office?
I'd rather call the president from outside the prison, thanks.
- Let me out!
Surely your mother taught you never to turn down a polite invitation.
My mother taught me an invitation is optional.
I hope you'll forgive me for making this invitation mandatory.
It's not every day we're honored with the presence of a vice minister of justice.
Come on, Vice Minister.
Calm down, let's go.
Where have you been?
You don't even answer your phone?
Sorry, I've, uh...
I've been working on it.
What the fuck does that mean?
Doing what?
I'm sorry.
Just trying to hold it together.
God, I just wanna go home.
I want my husband back.
- Do you think he's alive, Javi?
- Yeah.
No.
You're just not sure he's dead.
What's taking this guy so long?
General, with all due respect,
I don't think we should've let him go inside.
No.
I don't think Pablo is stupid enough to fuck with the vice minister.
Can I get you something to drink?
I don't need anything.
Look, don't be so nervous.
As soon as you have the president on the phone, you will make it clear that if he doesn't remove the troops surrounding the prison immediately, there will be grave consequences.
But if he withdraws the troops, we'll stay here quietly and complete our sentence.
Good evening, President Gaviria's office.
It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice.
I need to talk to the president.
One minute, please.
Mr. President, excuse the interruption.
There is a call from Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.
- Thank you, María.
- Excuse me.
Hello?
- Hello?
How long will I be here as a hostage?
You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.
Escobar has Sandoval inside the prison.
Hang up right now, Mr. President.
- Hang up, please.
- I need to know if he's OK.
Mr. President, hang up the phone.
If Escobar knows you're on the line, he might force you to strike a bargain.
Or worse, if you lie to him, he might kill Eduardo.
Hang up the phone.
Sir!
Leave us alone.
- They hung up.
- Bullshit.
Shut up!
So, then... the president is too busy to speak with me.
I don't understand how he ended up in that jail.
Me, either.
I don't know what Sandoval is doing.
What did he think, that he could convince Escobar he was there to help him?
We agreed that Ariza would have Escobar in custody.
Ariza must've had his reasons for holding off.
- Right.
- This is a very delicate situation.
You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.
Please, I suggest we call DAS to bring in a hostage negotiation team.
Do I have your permission?
Good.
María Clara, connect me with DAS, immediately.
- No.
No.
- Cancel the call.
- This time, we will not negotiate.
- I don't understand, Mr. President.
If Sandoval dies...
I will have it on my conscience for the rest of my life.
But my country comes first, and I will not empower Escobar.
Send in the Special Forces...
and finish this, once and for all.
I just realized something.
The president didn't just betray me... he also betrayed you.
He knew if you came here...
Look at me.
...there would be three options.
One:
I leave with you, peacefully.
Two:
I take you hostage.
Three:
I shoot you, and then, he really would have a good excuse to kill me.
Right?
Either way, he wins.
Right?
Maybe the president is betraying us both.
You could be right.
But you know something?
I'll sacrifice my life to make sure you're dead.
You think you're better than me, but you're wrong.
I come from nothing.
I fought hard to become what I am.

Don't kill him.

Now what?

Well, to be honest, after they snatched me,

They're gonna storm that bullshit fuckin' prison and blow his fuckin' head off!
I'm sorry you were taken against your will, but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly, given your last meeting with Navegante.
Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see your Cali cartel is doing so well, but you've made a huge mistake.

Don't move!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.
Keep low, and no matter what happens, keep moving.
Speak.
Yes, it's him.
Speak up, please, I can't hear you.
Is that confirmed?
Wait a minute.
Mr. President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval's been freed.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
And Escobar?
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
Look what we found.
Do you think he's OK?
I'm sure he's fine.

Ambassador, like you said, this is a Colombian matter.
What do we care?
I'm filing a report with the Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.
- Ambassador--
- Good, report to Washington.
'Cause if something isn't done, every American down here associated with the government is gonna look like a fool, including you.
I wasn't finished.
Until further notice, you're both suspended.
Go home.
MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?
[in Spanish] Mr. President, I just spoke with the attorney general.
Moncada's wife reported his disappearance from La Catedral.
It's clear that Escobar killed those men in that prison.
- I don't think he'd take it that far.
- Escobar is capable of anything.
But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.
Forgive me, Eduardo... but I'm having a hard time finding the silver lining in all this.
This is our opportunity to end Pablo's vacation.
[Latin guitar theme music plays]
[sighs]
[upbeat Latin song plays]
- [man in Spanish] Boss.
- Good morning, boss.
[low greetings in Spanish] [indistinct chatter]
[sniffing]
Ahh!
Good morning, boss.
Bad news.
Have the bodies disappeared?
[low murmurs] [in Spanish] Our agreement with him states he can't be moved to another prison.
Excuse me, but killing people in prison is a direct violation of our agreement.
Yes, yes, but we have to tread carefully.
If he feels we're violating his terms, he'll start putting bombs on street corners again.
Let's tell him we've uncovered threats against him from his biggest enemies.
That would give us the opportunity to bring him to Bogotá while we improve security at La Catedral.
The fourth brigade, commanded by General Ariza, would be the best choice to carry out this operation.
- Ariza?
- Yes, sir.
- Is he from Medellín?
- Yes, sir.
Hm.
Can we trust him?
Yes, sir.
[Steve] Success.
Sure, it cost me a suspension, but who cares?
I just call it a week's paternity leave.
I was ready to crack a beer and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.
See, because of me and Peña, the Colombian government was sending in the army.
Not the cops, but the fucking army.
There was no way that Escobar was getting out of this one.
But, then again, in Colombia... nothing goes down the way you think it will.
[grunting]
[in Spanish] I'm calling him.
Don Pablo, here...
Tata's on the phone.
I was just thinking there's nothing in the world I'd love more than to hear my wife's lovely voice.
Pablo, what's happening?
Why would something be happening here?
The soldiers.
Soldiers?
Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.
I don't know, Pablo.
Tell me what's happening.
No, my love, it's nothing.
Everything is cool.
I'll call back soon, all right?
I love you, baby.
Yes, my love.
Get out the weapons.
As you wish, sir.
[shouting orders in Spanish]
[overlapping shouts in Spanish]
[indistinct chatter]
Listen up, company!
You will be under the command of Lieutenant Dominguez.
Let's secure the perimeter.
Tell your men they have orders to shoot anyone
- trying to leave the prison, understood?
- [man] As you wish, General.
Dismissed.
- Juan Pablo, where are you going?
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.
- No, dear, you can't go there now.
- I said I want to go!
- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.
- He needs you to stay here to look after your sister.
Isn't that what he always says?
- But the soldiers are going to kill him.
- Don't ever say that in this house!
- They're going to kill him!
- Quiet!
[Connie in English] The car was outside the garage, still idling, the keys still in the ignition.
- I've called his phone 20 times.
- Did you call embassy security?
- No, I wanted to talk to you first.
- Good.
Don't.
What?
Why not?
Nothing.
I just...
I don't wanna ring any alarms before I check things out.
- What are you guys up to?
- Connie...
Just try to relax, OK?
I'm sure everything's fine.
- [scoffs]
- I'm gonna take care of this.
- I'll find out where he is, all right?
- [baby whimpers, sobs]
- [sighs]
- Look, I'll make you a drink.
[news chatter in Spanish over radio]
[in Spanish] Boss... they're gonna try to take you out of here and look for evidence on Moncada and Galeano.
If I leave this place, someone will kill me.
Or the Americans will use their power to restore extradition and send me to the US.
What the fuck, let's give those bastards lead.
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.
For every one of our men, they have 20!
- Let's do it now.
- Don't be an idiot.
Wait for the boss!
Stop bickering in front of the boss.
We have the escape routes.
We could get into the hills before they even know we're gone.
There is a time to fight... and there is a time to be clever.
Yes, sir.
- What's your plan?
- Let's talk to Gaviria.
Be smart.
Try to settle this matter peacefully.
If that fails?
[in English] What are you doing back here?
- I forgot my socks.
- [Noonan] I want you out in five minutes.
Son of a bitch.
These Colombians are knee-deep in a shit storm.
We gotta talk.
Back here.
What?
You get a hooker pregnant?
I think Agent Murphy got snatched.
I checked all area hospitals, police stations.
We were pursuing leads on the Cali cartel.
It could be related to that, or it could be Escobar.
Did you report it to the Regional Security Office?
If I tell the ROS, it becomes a five-alarm fire, and whoever has him might panic.
If it is Escobar, he's dead already.
Well, can you check your sources?
See what comes up?
[scoffs]
Jesus Christ.
Let me see what I can do.
[in Spanish] General Ariza has orders to secure Escobar.
I want you to go there and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.
- What do you mean, "legalize" it?
- Formalize it.
You'll reiterate that this is a temporary relocation while we renovate La Catedral to make it safer for him.
We both know that's not true.
But it's what you'll tell Escobar until he's safely inside a military brig.
Yes, Mr. President.
What's wrong?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Eduardo, I trust you... and this is too important to leave to someone I don't trust completely.
I'm at your service, Mr. President.
You know that very well.
Nothing will make me happier than to see that asshole get the justice he deserves.
[knock on window]
Checked my sources with the Colombian military.
Nobody knows jack shit.
So no indication Escobar had anything to do with Murphy's disappearance?
It's time to sound the alarm.
Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?
We call out the troops, he ends up dead like Diana Turbay.
- [starts engine]
- Thanks.
[helicopters circling]
[Velasco in Spanish] Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet until further notice, understand?
All right.
What else do you have?
- I know that.
- Velasco.
I'll call you back.
Yes, boss?
What's happening outside?
We don't know.
[sighs] [whispers] I fucked up.
[Velasco] What's that, boss?
Gather the boys.
And tell the prison guards they're to fire on anyone who tries to come in.
Boss, do you think the prison guards will follow your orders?
They'd better.
I hired them.
Excuse me.
Boss, the people from Medellín just informed me that some guy named Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.
Mm.
Good evening.
Where is General Ariza?
General!
[Ariza] Let him through.
Good evening, General.
- Mr. Vice Minister.
- How are you?
Pleasure to see you.
Good evening.
- Where's Escobar?
- Escobar?
Inside the prison, obviously.
What do you mean, he's in the prison?
I thought you were taking him into custody when you arrived.
I'm sorry, sir, but those were not my orders.
Then what were your orders?
My orders were to secure the perimeter, not let anyone in or out, and wait for you.
That's not what the president believes.
He's not going to be happy to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.
I'm sorry, but those were my orders.
I turned myself in to that punk...
the vice minister of justice.
But since there is no justice in this country, he is the vice minister of nothing.
This is good.
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.
[softly] This is very good.
General, I don't believe you understand your orders clearly.
- But I do.
- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?
I'm going to try to make a miracle happen.
I'm going in there to convince Escobar this is a temporary transfer of location.
And I'm also going to say that I'm here to guarantee his safety.
I can't allow you to put yourself in danger.
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough to kill the vice minister of justice right in front of the fourth brigade?
For God's sake.
[Ariza] At least let me make a call so they don't shoot you when you walk in!
Make it fast.
Open the door.
You two are coming with me.
Didn't you hear me?
Open the door!
General!
[Ariza] Listen to the vice minister!
Hurry up!
Open it.
[gate buzzes]
[Velasco] Vice Minister, good evening.
Pablo is waiting for you.
Go on.
Wait here.
[rock music playing over speakers]
Good evening, Vice Minister.
It's been a while.
Good evening.
I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.
My orders are to escort you to a temporary prison in Bogotá.
The government has decided to make some improvements here at La Catedral for your safety and everyone else's here.
[Pablo] Mm.
I would think Gaviria could come up with a more believable lie.
I know why you're here.
Because of Moncada and Galeano.
But I didn't kill those men.
That story is a lie.
And why should the government care about some dispute between gangsters?
We don't care about that.
You're mistaken.
You are betraying me, Vice Minister.
Gaviria is betraying me.
If your safety is a concern, I will gladly escort you out myself.
We have an agreement, and you're breaking it.
What guarantee do I have that the Americans won't kidnap me and take me to the US?
Bush would be very happy to stick me in a gringo jail, like he did to Lehder, like he did to Noriega, right?
That's not gonna happen, you have my word.
- Your word.
- Mm.
As vice minister of justice?
Yes.
I give you my word as vice minister of justice.
Haven't you noticed that the army has completely surrounded this jail?
We can end this peacefully... if you just cooperate and walk out with me.
Don Pablo, these bastards will kill you!
[low murmurs]
I respectfully decline your offer, Vice Minister.
The press is saying I killed those men, but that's a lie to sell newspapers.
If Gaviria wants me out of here... he can come here...
and do it himself.
Meanwhile...
I'll view any incursion as a declaration of war.
I'll inform the president of your position.
Excuse me.
[Pablo] Mr. Vice Minister.
Why walk all that way when I have a telephone in my office?
I'd rather call the president from outside the prison, thanks.
[indistinct murmurs]
- Let me out!
- [low chatter]
Surely your mother taught you never to turn down a polite invitation.
My mother taught me an invitation is optional.
I hope you'll forgive me for making this invitation mandatory.
It's not every day we're honored with the presence of a vice minister of justice.
Come on, Vice Minister.
Calm down, let's go.
[sighs]
[in English] Where have you been?
You don't even answer your phone?
Sorry, I've, uh...
I've been working on it.
What the fuck does that mean?
Doing what?
[sighs]
I'm sorry.
Just trying to hold it together.
God, I just wanna go home.
I want my husband back.
- Do you think he's alive, Javi?
- Yeah.
No.
You're just not sure he's dead.
[in Spanish] What's taking this guy so long?
General, with all due respect,
I don't think we should've let him go inside.
No.
I don't think Pablo is stupid enough to fuck with the vice minister.
[sniffs]
[Pablo] Can I get you something to drink?
I don't need anything.
Look, don't be so nervous.
As soon as you have the president on the phone, you will make it clear that if he doesn't remove the troops surrounding the prison immediately, there will be grave consequences.
But if he withdraws the troops, we'll stay here quietly and complete our sentence.
[phone ringing] [in Spanish] Good evening, President Gaviria's office.
It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice.
I need to talk to the president.
One minute, please.
[indistinct chatter]
Mr. President, excuse the interruption.
There is a call from Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.
- Thank you, María.
- Excuse me.
Hello?
- Hello?
- [sighs]
How long will I be here as a hostage?
[Pablo] You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.
Escobar has Sandoval inside the prison.
Hang up right now, Mr. President.
- Hang up, please.
- I need to know if he's OK.
Mr. President, hang up the phone.
If Escobar knows you're on the line, he might force you to strike a bargain.
Or worse, if you lie to him, he might kill Eduardo.
Hang up the phone.
Sir!
Leave us alone.
[exhales]
- They hung up.
- [man] Bullshit.
Shut up!
[helicopter passes overhead]
So, then... the president is too busy to speak with me.
I don't understand how he ended up in that jail.
Me, either.
I don't know what Sandoval is doing.
What did he think, that he could convince Escobar he was there to help him?
We agreed that Ariza would have Escobar in custody.
Ariza must've had his reasons for holding off.
- Right.
- This is a very delicate situation.
You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.
Please, I suggest we call DAS to bring in a hostage negotiation team.
Do I have your permission?
Good.
María Clara, connect me with DAS, immediately.
- No.
No.
- Cancel the call.
[hangs up phone]
- This time, we will not negotiate.
- I don't understand, Mr. President.
If Sandoval dies...
I will have it on my conscience for the rest of my life.
But my country comes first, and I will not empower Escobar.
Send in the Special Forces...
and finish this, once and for all.
[Pablo] I just realized something.
The president didn't just betray me... he also betrayed you.
He knew if you came here...
Look at me.
...there would be three options.
One:
I leave with you, peacefully.
Two:
I take you hostage.
Three:
I shoot you, and then, he really would have a good excuse to kill me.
Right?
[Pablo sighs]
Either way, he wins.
Right?
Maybe the president is betraying us both.
You could be right.
But you know something?
I'll sacrifice my life to make sure you're dead.
You think you're better than me, but you're wrong.
I come from nothing.
I fought hard to become what I am.
If the government hadn't come after me...
I would be where you are now...
the vice minister of justice.
You and I are nothing alike.
You are a criminal.
And criminals can't run forever.
[Velasco] Sir.
[whispers indistinctly]
Your friend Gaviria has ordered Special Forces to raid the prison while you're still inside.
I would have done the same thing.
Don't kill him.
If he dies... it will be at the hands of his own government.
Good luck, Vice Minister.
[overlapping chatter]
[sighs]
[in English] Now what?
I'm sorry, Ambassador.
We have a situation.
[Noonan] Damn right we do.
Hey, partner.
[Steve] Remember how I told you that no one in their right mind would ever kill a DEA agent?
Well, to be honest, after they snatched me,
I'd forgotten that, myself.
But then, I calmed down and realized that if they wanted to kill me, they would've blown my brains out right in front of my house.
- This... was something different.
- [opera music playing]
I figured this was Escobar knowing that they were coming to get him, and grabbing a get-out-of-jail-free card: me.
[in English] Sit.
[Steve] Man, you fucked up.
You think that they're gonna make a trade for me?
No.
No!
They're gonna storm that bullshit fuckin' prison and blow his fuckin' head off!
[in English] I'm sorry you were taken against your will, but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly, given your last meeting with Navegante.
[music stops]
Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see your Cali cartel is doing so well, but you've made a huge mistake.
I don't see it that way.
I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking the liberty of making you a cocktail.
I just learned how to do a really interesting passion fruit daiquiri.
That's wonderful, but I don't want your fuckin' daiquiri.
You're free to leave anytime.
We are a long way from Bogotá.
Fine.
I'm leaving.
I'll show myself out.
[Pacho] I thought you might like to see some pictures I have.
Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo to ID a location where Pablo's sicarios were gathering.
Two hours later, they were dead.
Along with an innocent woman.
OK.
[Steve on recording] Poison will be at La Dispensaria at around midnight with his crew.
[scoffs]
Who's your contact at the embassy?
Did you know she had two kids?
What do you think our newspapers will think of that?
Our government doesn't take too kindly to American-backed death squads.
I could blackmail you with these pictures.
You'd lose your career at the DEA, go to jail...
maybe here in Colombia.
But don't worry.
I won't ask you or Javier Peña to cross any line you haven't already crossed.
So you think the DEA and Cali cartel would be a good match.
There are many, in every segment of Colombia, who have been persecuted by Pablo Escobar.
The families of Moncada and Galeano, the families of judges and police... people with resources who need to be unified.
They want vengeance.
- And you'll help them get it?
- With your help.
I can't make any commitments right now.
But I can tell you this:
When Pablo goes down, and he will go down... you'll hear a knock at your door, and it'll be me.
You haven't tried my daiquiri.
That Herrera's a pretty good host.
Makes a mean cocktail, gives you door-to-door service right to the embassy.
- What did Herrera say?
- What'd he say?
What'd he say?
[softly] You fuckin' gave him that information.
He's got pictures on me, he's got tape on me, Javi.
Answer me.
- [softly] What?
- Did you give that shit to Herrera?
- Do you think I would do that to you?
- Are you playing with Cali, Javi?
That your version of "all in"?
I got one goal: get Escobar.
That's not an answer.
Who gave him the fucking photos?
Hey.
See you around, Jav.
I'm gonna go call my wife.
[hushed chatter in Spanish]
[in Spanish] Sir, I have her on the line.
- Hello, my love.
- [Tata] Hello.
Look, we're having a little problem here.
We're trying to solve it, but you know what to do... if it doesn't work out, right?
Yes, Pablo.
I love you very much.
Me, too.
- Very much.
- Goodbye, my love.
[indistinct whispers in Spanish]
We are bandits.
[low murmurs]
[loud explosion] [indistinct shouts]
- Wait a minute!
What is this?
- Your brigade is no longer in charge!
[shouting indistinctly in Spanish]
- [automatic gunfire] - [shouts in Spanish]
You've gotta get me out of here, do you understand?
Come on, come on.
- [groans] - [indistinct shouts]
[indistinct shouts] [alarm wailing]
- [gunfire] - [indistinct chatter]
- [man] Hurry up!
- Get down!
No!
Get in there!
[overlapping shouts] [grunts] [automatic gunfire]
[whimpering]
Don't move, don't move!
[automatic gunfire] [grenade rolling]
[automatic gunfire]
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
[man grunts]
- [gunfire] - [man groans]
- Don't move!
Don't move!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.
Keep low, and no matter what happens, keep moving.
[indistinct shouts in Spanish]
[phone rings]
Speak.
Yes, it's him.
Speak up, please, I can't hear you.
Is that confirmed?
Wait a minute. [sighs]
Mr. President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval's been freed.
[excited chatter]
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
And Escobar?
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
[overlapping chatter in Spanish] [man] Look what we found.
Do you think he's OK?
I'm sure he's fine.
[man in Spanish] See you tomorrow.
Good night.
[in English] It's OK... it's OK.
It's OK.
Steve...
I just wanna go home.
This is home.
[sharp breath]
[Steve] Less than an hour after Escobar escaped La Catedral, word had spread all over Colombia that war was coming again.
But this time would be different.
This time, there would be no surrender... no negotiations... no deals.
This time...
we were gonna kill him.
Escobar said, "Better a grave in Colombia than a cell in the US."
Well, guess what, motherfucker?
That works for me.
[rock music plays]
When the public found out about the excessive lifestyle of the prisoners at La Catedral, the police began an investigation into the supposed capital crimes being committed by Pablo Escobar within the prison walls.
The central part of this investigation involves the disappearance of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.
- Agent Peña?
- What's this?
It's from upstairs.
Oh, I get a card.
Oh, CIA.
"Congratulations, Central Intelligence Agency."
This is, uh... this is blowing up a little bit more than we expected, no?
Well, hopefully, the son of a bitch rots in jail.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We gotta transfer him first.
- I forbade you to leak this.
- How do you know it was us?
- Escobar has a lot of enemies.
- 'Course it was you.
Whoever did this, it doesn't really matter now.
What's done is done.
Ambassador, like you said, this is a Colombian matter.
What do we care?
I'm filing a report with the Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.
- Ambassador--
- Good, report to Washington.
'Cause if something isn't done, every American down here associated with the government is gonna look like a fool, including you.
I wasn't finished.
Until further notice, you're both suspended.
Go home.
MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?
Mr. President, I just spoke with the attorney general.
Moncada's wife reported his disappearance from La Catedral.
It's clear that Escobar killed those men in that prison.
- I don't think he'd take it that far.
- Escobar is capable of anything.
But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.
Forgive me, Eduardo... but I'm having a hard time finding the silver lining in all this.
This is our opportunity to end Pablo's vacation.
- Boss.
- Good morning, boss.
Ahh!
Good morning, boss.
Bad news.
Have the bodies disappeared?
Our agreement with him states he can't be moved to another prison.
Excuse me, but killing people in prison is a direct violation of our agreement.
Yes, yes, but we have to tread carefully.
If he feels we're violating his terms, he'll start putting bombs on street corners again.
Let's tell him we've uncovered threats against him from his biggest enemies.
That would give us the opportunity to bring him to Bogotá while we improve security at La Catedral.
The fourth brigade, commanded by General Ariza, would be the best choice to carry out this operation.
- Ariza?
- Yes, sir.
- Is he from Medellín?
- Yes, sir.
Hm.
Can we trust him?
Yes, sir.
Success.
Sure, it cost me a suspension, but who cares?
I just call it a week's paternity leave.
I was ready to crack a beer and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.
See, because of me and Peña, the Colombian government was sending in the army.
Not the cops, but the fucking army.
There was no way that Escobar was getting out of this one.
But, then again, in Colombia... nothing goes down the way you think it will.
I'm calling him.
Don Pablo, here...
Tata's on the phone.
I was just thinking there's nothing in the world I'd love more than to hear my wife's lovely voice.
Pablo, what's happening?
Why would something be happening here?
The soldiers.
Soldiers?
Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.
I don't know, Pablo.
Tell me what's happening.
No, my love, it's nothing.
Everything is cool.
I'll call back soon, all right?
I love you, baby.
Yes, my love.
Get out the weapons.
As you wish, sir.
Listen up, company!
You will be under the command of Lieutenant Dominguez.
Let's secure the perimeter.
Tell your men they have orders to shoot anyone
- trying to leave the prison, understood?
- As you wish, General.
Dismissed.
- Juan Pablo, where are you going?
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.
- No, dear, you can't go there now.
- I said I want to go!
- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.
- He needs you to stay here to look after your sister.
Isn't that what he always says?
- But the soldiers are going to kill him.
- Don't ever say that in this house!
- They're going to kill him!
- Quiet!
The car was outside the garage, still idling, the keys still in the ignition.
- I've called his phone 20 times.
- Did you call embassy security?
- No, I wanted to talk to you first.
- Good.
Don't.
What?
Why not?
Nothing.
I just...
I don't wanna ring any alarms before I check things out.
- What are you guys up to?
- Connie...
Just try to relax, OK?
I'm sure everything's fine.
I'm gonna take care of this.
I'll find out where he is, all right?
Look, I'll make you a drink.
Boss... they're gonna try to take you out of here and look for evidence on Moncada and Galeano.
If I leave this place, someone will kill me.

I'm at your service, Mr. President.
You know that very well.
Nothing will make me happier than to see that asshole get the justice he deserves.
Checked my sources with the Colombian military.
Nobody knows jack shit.
So no indication Escobar had anything to do with Murphy's disappearance?
It's time to sound the alarm.
Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?
We call out the troops, he ends up dead like Diana Turbay.
Thanks.
Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet until further notice, understand?
All right.
What else do you have?
- I know that.
- Velasco.
I'll call you back.
Yes, boss?
What's happening outside?
We don't know.
I fucked up.
What's that, boss?
Gather the boys.
And tell the prison guards they're to fire on anyone who tries to come in.
Boss, do you think the prison guards will follow your orders?
They'd better.
I hired them.
Excuse me.
Boss, the people from Medellín just informed me that some guy named Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.
Mm.
Good evening.
Where is General Ariza?
General!
Let him through.
Good evening, General.
- Mr. Vice Minister.
- How are you?
Pleasure to see you.
Good evening.
- Where's Escobar?
- Escobar?
Inside the prison, obviously.
What do you mean, he's in the prison?
I thought you were taking him into custody when you arrived.
I'm sorry, sir, but those were not my orders.
Then what were your orders?
My orders were to secure the perimeter, not let anyone in or out, and wait for you.
That's not what the president believes.
He's not going to be happy to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.
I'm sorry, but those were my orders.
I turned myself in to that punk...
the vice minister of justice.
But since there is no justice in this country, he is the vice minister of nothing.
This is good.
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.
This is very good.
General, I don't believe you understand your orders clearly.
- But I do.
- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?
I'm going to try to make a miracle happen.
I'm going in there to convince Escobar this is a temporary transfer of location.
And I'm also going to say that I'm here to guarantee his safety.
I can't allow you to put yourself in danger.
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough to kill the vice minister of justice right in front of the fourth brigade?
For God's sake.
At least let me make a call so they don't shoot you when you walk in!
Make it fast.
Open the door.
You two are coming with me.
Didn't you hear me?
Open the door!
General!
Listen to the vice minister!
Hurry up!
Open it.
Vice Minister, good evening.
Pablo is waiting for you.
Go on.
Wait here.
Good evening, Vice Minister.
It's been a while.
Good evening.
I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.
My orders are to escort you to a temporary prison in Bogotá.
The government has decided to make some improvements here at La Catedral for your safety and everyone else's here.
Mm.
I would think Gaviria could come up with a more believable lie.
I know why you're here.
Because of Moncada and Galeano.
But I didn't kill those men.
That story is a lie.
And why should the government care about some dispute between gangsters?
We don't care about that.
You're mistaken.
You are betraying me, Vice Minister.
Gaviria is betraying me.
If your safety is a concern, I will gladly escort you out myself.
We have an agreement, and you're breaking it.
What guarantee do I have that the Americans won't kidnap me and take me to the US?
Bush would be very happy to stick me in a gringo jail, like he did to Lehder, like he did to Noriega, right?
That's not gonna happen, you have my word.
- Your word.
- Mm.
As vice minister of justice?
Yes.
I give you my word as vice minister of justice.
Haven't you noticed that the army has completely surrounded this jail?
We can end this peacefully... if you just cooperate and walk out with me.
Don Pablo, these bastards will kill you!
I respectfully decline your offer, Vice Minister.
The press is saying I killed those men, but that's a lie to sell newspapers.
If Gaviria wants me out of here... he can come here...
and do it himself.
Meanwhile...
I'll view any incursion as a declaration of war.
I'll inform the president of your position.
Excuse me.
Mr. Vice Minister.
Why walk all that way when I have a telephone in my office?
I'd rather call the president from outside the prison, thanks.
Let me out!
Surely your mother taught you never to turn down a polite invitation.
My mother taught me an invitation is optional.
I hope you'll forgive me for making this invitation mandatory.
It's not every day we're honored with the presence of a vice minister of justice.
Come on, Vice Minister.
Calm down, let's go.
Where have you been?
You don't even answer your phone?
Sorry, I've, uh...
I've been working on it.
What the fuck does that mean?
Doing what?
I'm sorry.
Just trying to hold it together.
God, I just wanna go home.
I want my husband back.
- Do you think he's alive, Javi?
- Yeah.
No.
You're just not sure he's dead.
What's taking this guy so long?
General, with all due respect,
I don't think we should've let him go inside.
No.
I don't think Pablo is stupid enough to fuck with the vice minister.
Can I get you something to drink?
I don't need anything.
Look, don't be so nervous.
As soon as you have the president on the phone, you will make it clear that if he doesn't remove the troops surrounding the prison immediately, there will be grave consequences.
But if he withdraws the troops, we'll stay here quietly and complete our sentence.
Good evening, President Gaviria's office.
It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice.
I need to talk to the president.
One minute, please.
Mr. President, excuse the interruption.
There is a call from Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.
- Thank you, María.
- Excuse me.
Hello?
Hello?
How long will I be here as a hostage?
You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.
Escobar has Sandoval inside the prison.
Hang up right now, Mr. President.
- Hang up, please.
- I need to know if he's OK.
Mr. President, hang up the phone.
If Escobar knows you're on the line, he might force you to strike a bargain.
Or worse, if you lie to him, he might kill Eduardo.
Hang up the phone.
Sir!
Leave us alone.
- They hung up.
- Bullshit.
Shut up!
So, then... the president is too busy to speak with me.
I don't understand how he ended up in that jail.
Me, either.
I don't know what Sandoval is doing.
What did he think, that he could convince Escobar he was there to help him?
We agreed that Ariza would have Escobar in custody.
Ariza must've had his reasons for holding off.
- Right.
- This is a very delicate situation.
You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.
Please, I suggest we call DAS to bring in a hostage negotiation team.
Do I have your permission?
Good.
María Clara, connect me with DAS, immediately.
- No.
No.
- Cancel the call.
- This time, we will not negotiate.
- I don't understand, Mr. President.
If Sandoval dies...
I will have it on my conscience for the rest of my life.
But my country comes first, and I will not empower Escobar.
Send in the Special Forces...
and finish this, once and for all.
I just realized something.
The president didn't just betray me... he also betrayed you.
He knew if you came here...
Look at me.
...there would be three options.
One:
I leave with you, peacefully.
Two:
I take you hostage.
Three:
I shoot you, and then, he really would have a good excuse to kill me.
Right?
Either way, he wins.
Right?
Maybe the president is betraying us both.
You could be right.
But you know something?
I'll sacrifice my life to make sure you're dead.
You think you're better than me, but you're wrong.
I come from nothing.
I fought hard to become what I am.
If the government hadn't come after me...
I would be where you are now...
the vice minister of justice.
You and I are nothing alike.
You are a criminal.
And criminals can't run forever.
Sir.
Your friend Gaviria has ordered Special Forces to raid the prison while you're still inside.
I would have done the same thing.
Don't kill him.
If he dies... it will be at the hands of his own government.
Good luck, Vice Minister.
Now what?
I'm sorry, Ambassador.
We have a situation.
Damn right we do.
Hey, partner.
Remember how I told you that no one in their right mind would ever kill a DEA agent?
Well, to be honest, after they snatched me,
I'd forgotten that, myself.
But then, I calmed down and realized that if they wanted to kill me, they would've blown my brains out right in front of my house.
This... was something different.
I figured this was Escobar knowing that they were coming to get him, and grabbing a get-out-of-jail-free card: me.
Sit.
Man, you fucked up.
You think that they're gonna make a trade for me?
No.
No!
They're gonna storm that bullshit fuckin' prison and blow his fuckin' head off!
I'm sorry you were taken against your will, but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly, given your last meeting with Navegante.
Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see your Cali cartel is doing so well, but you've made a huge mistake.
I don't see it that way.
I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking the liberty of making you a cocktail.
I just learned how to do a really interesting passion fruit daiquiri.
That's wonderful, but I don't want your fuckin' daiquiri.
You're free to leave anytime.
We are a long way from Bogotá.
Fine.
I'm leaving.
I'll show myself out.
I thought you might like to see some pictures I have.
Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo to ID a location where Pablo's sicarios were gathering.
Two hours later, they were dead.
Along with an innocent woman.
OK.
Poison will be at La Dispensaria at around midnight with his crew.
Who's your contact at the embassy?
Did you know she had two kids?
What do you think our newspapers will think of that?
Our government doesn't take too kindly to American-backed death squads.
I could blackmail you with these pictures.
You'd lose your career at the DEA, go to jail...
maybe here in Colombia.
But don't worry.
I won't ask you or Javier Peña to cross any line you haven't already crossed.
So you think the DEA and Cali cartel would be a good match.
There are many, in every segment of Colombia, who have been persecuted by Pablo Escobar.
The families of Moncada and Galeano, the families of judges and police... people with resources who need to be unified.
They want vengeance.
- And you'll help them get it?
- With your help.
I can't make any commitments right now.
But I can tell you this:
When Pablo goes down, and he will go down... you'll hear a knock at your door, and it'll be me.
You haven't tried my daiquiri.
That Herrera's a pretty good host.
Makes a mean cocktail, gives you door-to-door service right to the embassy.
- What did Herrera say?
- What'd he say?
What'd he say?
You fuckin' gave him that information.
He's got pictures on me, he's got tape on me, Javi.
Answer me.
- What?
- Did you give that shit to Herrera?
- Do you think I would do that to you?
- Are you playing with Cali, Javi?
That your version of "all in"?
I got one goal: get Escobar.
That's not an answer.
Who gave him the fucking photos?
Hey.
See you around, Jav.
I'm gonna go call my wife.
Sir, I have her on the line.
- Hello, my love.
- Hello.
Look, we're having a little problem here.
We're trying to solve it, but you know what to do... if it doesn't work out, right?
Yes, Pablo.
I love you very much.
Me, too.
- Very much.
- Goodbye, my love.
We are bandits.
- Wait a minute!
What is this?
- Your brigade is no longer in charge!
You've gotta get me out of here, do you understand?
Come on, come on.
- Hurry up!
- Get down!
No!
Get in there!
Don't move, don't move!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- Don't move!
Don't move!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.
Keep low, and no matter what happens, keep moving.
Speak.
Yes, it's him.
Speak up, please, I can't hear you.
Is that confirmed?
Wait a minute.
Mr. President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval's been freed.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
And Escobar?
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
- All clear!
Look what we found.
Do you think he's OK?
I'm sure he's fine.
See you tomorrow.
Good night.
It's OK... it's OK.
It's OK.
Steve...
I just wanna go home.
This is home.
Less than an hour after Escobar escaped La Catedral, word had spread all over Colombia that war was coming again.
But this time would be different.
This time, there would be no surrender... no negotiations... no deals.
This time...
we were gonna kill him.
Escobar said, "Better a grave in Colombia than a cell in the US."
Well, guess what, motherfucker?
That works for me.

Douglas:
THIS IS AN ASTONISHINGLY CHANCE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN WESTERN CLIMBERS AND THE SHERPAS.
WHEN CLIMBING BEGAN, THE SHERPAS HAD NO CONCEPTION
OF WHAT MOUNTAINEERING MIGHT BE,
AND YET, SUDDENLY THEY WERE ON THIS JOURNEY
FROM BEING PEOPLE WHO JUST GENETICALLY WERE REALLY GOOD
AT ALTITUDE TO BECOMING,
YOU KNOW, INTERNATIONAL MOUNTAIN GUIDES 100 YEARS LATER.
Man:
1953 -
- CORONATION YEAR.
THE WORLD WAS TURNED BY THE NEWS
THAT EVEREST HAD AT LAST BEEN CONQUERED
BY A BRITISH EXPEDITION LED BY COLONEL JOHN HUNT.
ACCOMPANIED BY THE FAMOUS SHERPA TENZING,
EDMUND HILLARY CLIMBED THE SUMMIT
OF THE WORLD'S HIGHEST MOUNTAIN.
Douglas:
WHEN TENZING NORGAY REACHED THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST,
THAT IS SUCH AN AMAZING MOMENT.
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS
IN CLIMBING HISTORY.
THAT'S THE MOMENT WHEN THE WORD "SHERPA"
HAS THE MEANING OF BRAND IN THE WAY THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT.
THE WORLD WAS CAPTIVATED BY TENZING.
AND HE FIXED IN OUR MINDS THE POPULAR IMAGE OF A SHERPA,
AS THIS SMILING, FRIENDLY, ALMOST HEROIC FIGURE.
Jamling:
A LOT OF THE WESTERN WORLD
DO NOT KNOW WHAT A SHERPA IS.
SO, A SHERPA, YOU KNOW -- YOU CLIMB MOUNTAINS, YOU KNOW?
AND THAT'S THE FIRST INSTINCT,
BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT WE ARE
ACTUALLY AN ETHNIC GROUP OF PEOPLE.
WE BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION -- LIFE AFTER DEATH.
AND YOU CONTINUE TO BE REBORN AND REBORN AND REBORN
UNTIL THE DAY YOU REACH NIRVANA.
SO, YOUR NEXT LIFE IS DETERMINED BY YOUR DEEDS OF THIS LIFE.
WE SHERPA PEOPLE HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MOUNTAIN.
Norgay:
OVER HERE, WE CLIMB MOUNTAINS,
BUT IT'S A HOLY PLACE.
THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN, YOU KNOW,
THE ATTITUDE, THE FEELING.
WESTERN PEOPLE APPROACH IT AS A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE --
PUSH YOUR LIMIT TO SEE HOW CLOSE YOU CAN GET TO DEATH.
BUT THERE'S 1,000-YEAR-OLD STORIES
WE HAVE ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN'S HISTORY,
WHICH THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT.
AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE ADAPT AND LEARN AND RESPECT IT.
SOME PEOPLE DON'T.
Douglas:
IF PHURBA IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CLIMBING SHERPAS
OF HIS GENERATION,
THEN HIS COUNTERPART AMONGST EXPEDITION LEADERS
IS HIS BOSS, RUSSELL BRICE.
Brice:
I'VE BEEN RUNNING COMMERCIAL EXPEDITIONS HERE
SINCE 1994.
I THINK I'M THE PERSON THAT'S BEEN
ON MORE EVEREST EXPEDITIONS THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD.
IT'S ALL OXYGEN.
-ALL OXYGEN.
AND I BROUGHT THOSE TWO BROKEN ONES IN KATHMANDU.
HOW CAN I EXPLAIN PHURBA TASHI?
THIS YEAR, HE MIGHT CLIMB EVEREST 22 TIMES --
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD --
AND SUCH A SPECIAL PERSON.
HE'S INCREDIBLY STRONG ON THE MOUNTAIN.
[ CHUCKLING ]
GOOD IDEA.
WATER HERE.
HI, GUYS.
LOTS OF NEW FACES.
¶¶
[ HORN HONKING ]
[ HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING ]
Douglas:
THE SERVICE-INDUSTRY ASPECT
OF CLIMBING EVEREST HAS DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPED.
[ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ]
SO WHAT MOUNTAINEERS IN 1975 MAYBE WOULD HAVE PUT UP WITH,
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING NOW WANT SOMETHING A BIT MORE.
YOU KNOW, THEY WANT A VERY COMFORTABLE BASE CAMP.
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.
SO MUCH WORK FOR THESE GUYS
TO MAKE ALL THESE PLATFORMS AND PUT TENTS UP.
[ MEN SHOUTING ]
THE ACTIVITY HERE HAS CHANGED UTTERLY.
IT HAS BECOME AN INDUSTRY,
AND THAT INDUSTRY IS PEOPLE, LARGELY, BY SHERPAS.
[ SINGING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ]
AND THEY MAY NOT STILL FULLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT IS THAT COMPELS US TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS,
BUT THEY ARE FANTASTICALLY GOOD AT DELIVERING THE EXPERIENCE.
[ MEN SHOUTING ]

Woodward:
SO FAR, SO GOOD, ACTUALLY.
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING AND SOUNDING QUITE HEALTHY.
A COUPLE MILD HEADACHES, BUT THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.
OKAY, FOLKS.
LET'S ROLL ON OUT OF TOWN.
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

Steven:
IN THE OLD DAYS,
PEOPLE DID EVERYTHING ON THE MOUNTAIN TOGETHER.
AND TODAY, THE MOUNTAIN HAS CHANGED IN THAT
THE OPERATORS TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.
Brice:
IN THE OLD DAYS,
IF YOU GOT ONE PERSON ON THE SUMMIT,
THAT WAS SUCCESS.
NOW, WE NEED TO GET EVERYONE ON THE SUMMIT.
SO IF YOU WANT TO GET EVERYONE ON THE SUMMIT,
YOU NEED MUCH MORE CREATURE COMFORT.
CERTAINLY THE TYPE OF PERSON
THAT COMES ON AN EXPEDITION HAS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY.
WE BRING PEOPLE HERE TO HELP THEM FULFILL THEIR DREAMS.
HEY!
YEAH!
[ CHUCKLES ]
PHURBA, HOW'S IT GOING?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOU BOYS HAVE DONE HARD WORK.
OH!
HEY, PHURBA.
PETER.
HOW ARE YOU?
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S BEEN A GOAL AS A CLIMBER.
I KNOW TO A LOT OF CLIMBERS, IT MIGHT BE TRIVIAL,
BUT TO ME, BEING ON TOP OF EVEREST
IS JUST AN ACHIEVEMENT OF A DREAM.
Johnson:
PART OF THE REASON WHY YOU WANT TO COME AND CLIMB --
YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE THOSE THINGS,
SEE IF YOU CAN DO IT, SEE IF YOU CAN PHYSICALLY DO IT.
IT'S A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING.
THE TRAINING IS PHENOMENAL.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU PUT TOGETHER IN A COUPLE WEEKS.
IT'S MONTHS OF PLANNING AND MONTHS OF GETTING ORGANIZED.
EVEREST HAS ALWAYS BEEN ATTRACTIVE
FOR SEVERAL REASONS FOR ME.
I LOVE THE BUDDHIST SIDE TO IT.
I LOVE THE WHOLE -- I LOVE THE NEPALESE PEOPLE.
SO, FOR ME, IT'S BEEN A MORE ENJOYABLE MOUNTAIN THAN MOST
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S SO COOL,
THAT YOU GET TO SHARE IT WITH THESE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.
[ PAN CLANGING ]
Man:
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A MAN SO PARTICULAR?
Man #2:
ARE YOU WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW?
Man #3:
IT'S LIKE A CAVEMAN.
Douglas:
AND SO, FOR JUST EIGHT HECTIC WEEKS EACH YEAR,
EVEREST BASE CAMP BECOMES THIS THRIVING VILLAGE.
AND IN RECENT YEARS, OVERCROWDING ON EVEREST
HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF A LOT OF CONTROVERSY.
Williams:
IT MIGHT JUST BE THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH
YOU'D EXPECT TO FIND A TRAFFIC JAM --
THE TOP OF THE WORLD -- MOUNT EVEREST.
Man #4:
THESE ARCHIVE IMAGES SHOW HOW LINEUPS
CAUSE LONG AND UNNECESSARY DELAYS.
Man #5:
MORE THAN 4,000 CLIMBERS HAVE BEEN TO THE TOP OF EVEREST.
600 PEOPLE DO IT IN A GOOD YEAR.
IT HAS BECOME A VERY NECESSARY PART OF THE NEPALESE ECONOMY.
Man #6:
EXPEDITION COMPANIES CHARGE UP TO $100,000
TO CLIENTS WANTING TO MAKE THE ASCENT.
Man #7:
CLIMBING EVEREST HAS BECOME A BUCKET LIST AMBITION
AND A MULTI-MILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY.
Douglas:
THIS IS A, YOU KNOW, BIG EMPLOYER --
LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE.
THERE ARE MORE SHERPAS WORKING ON THE MOUNTAIN NOW
THAN THERE EVER HAVE BEEN IN HISTORY.
BUT THEY ONLY GET A SMALL FRACTION OF THE PIE.
Man #5:
THE SHERPA GUIDES EARN UP TO $5,000
FOR A TWO-MONTH EXPEDITION, 10 TIMES THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PAY
IN THEIR ISOLATED HOMELAND.
Douglas:
THE WHOLE EVEREST CIRCUS
JUST SEEMS TO GET BIGGER AND BIGGER,
AND THIS SEASON IS NO EXCEPTION.
RUSSELL BRICE'S TEAM IS JUST ONE OF 38 EXPEDITIONS
ON THE MOUNTAIN THIS YEAR.
ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE LOOKED AFTER,
AND ALL THEIR EQUIPMENT HAS TO BE MOVED UP THE MOUNTAIN.
YOU HAVE GOOGLE MAPS
PHOTOGRAPHING THE ROUTE TO THE SUMMIT.
THERE'S A HOLLYWOOD FEATURE FILM.
THERE'S EVEN A GUY IN A WINGSUIT
TRYING TO JUMP OFF THE TOP AND FLY ALL THE WAY DOWN.
Flisler:
SO, WE'RE HERE TO PUT ON ONE
OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS TELEVISION PROJECTS
IN THE HISTORY OF THE MEDIA WORLD.
SO HE'LL BE FLYING DOWN HERE,
AND WE'RE GONNA BE BROADCASTING IT ALL LIVE.
THERE'S A REASON THAT SUPERMAN MOVIES
OR BATMAN MOVIES AND SPIDER-MAN --
ALL THESE SUPERHEROES ARE SO POPULAR.
I CAN DO WHAT THOSE GUYS CAN DO.
Wardle:
IT'S KIND OF DAFT,
BUT YOU KNOW, IN THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE,
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS THINKING OF NEW CRAZY THINGS TO DO.
Douglas:
IT'S PART OF THE DEAL NOW --
IS THAT THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF STRANGE NOTIONS
OF WHAT CAN BE DONE ON EVEREST SIMPLY TO ATTRACT ATTENTION.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
THE WAY THESE COMMERCIAL EXPEDITIONS CLIMB EVEREST
IS TO ESTABLISH A SERIES OF HIGHER AND HIGHER CAMPS,
STOCKING THEM OVER A PERIOD OF WEEKS
WITH EVERYTHING REQUIRED TO GIVE THE CLIENTS
THE BEST CHANCE OF REACHING THE SUMMIT.
[ WIND HOWLING ]
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T PERMIT EQUIPMENT
TO BE FLOWN UP THE MOUNTAIN,
SO EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO BUILDING THESE CAMPS
HAS TO BE CARRIED.
[ LAUGHS ]
Douglas:
AND IT'S THE SHERPAS THAT DO THAT WORK,
INCLUDING GOING THROUGH WHAT IS ITS MOST DANGEROUS SECTION.
¶¶
IF YOU WANT TO CLIMB EVEREST FROM THE SOUTH,
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE KHUMBU ICEFALL.
IT'S THE ROUTE UP EVEREST MOST COMMERCIAL OPERATORS PREFER,
PARTLY BECAUSE OF POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY
ON THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN IN TIBET,
WHICH THEY'D RATHER AVOID.
McKinley:
THE KHUMBU ICEFALL IS LIKE A WATERFALL OF ICE
COMING OUT OF THE WESTERN CWM.
THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
THAT A MOUNTAINEER WOULD GO THROUGH AN ICEFALL LIKE THIS.
BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY ACCESS ON THE SOUTH SIDE TO EVEREST,
THEN PEOPLE DO WALK THROUGH THIS JUMBLE OF ICE.
THE PROBLEM WITH THE ICEFALL IS THAT IT'S UNCONTROLLABLE.
ALL THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT ARE DANGEROUS
HAVE, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF SAFETY,
HAVE BEEN IMPROVED OVER THE YEARS.
BUT THE ICEFALL REMAINS, YOU KNOW, PERILOUS.
¶¶
[ METAL CLANKS ]
Douglas:
THERE ARE THREATS FROM EVERY DIRECTION.
NOT ONLY THAT -- THERE ARE BIG BLOCKS OF ICE
FALLING DOWN WITHOUT WARNING FROM ABOVE.
YOU'RE ASKING MEN TO GO TO WORK IN A VERY DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT.
AND IT'S BECOMING MORE SO AS THE SERACS,
THESE GIANT BLOCKS OF GLACIAL ICE,
ARE AFFECTED BY THE FORCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
THEY'RE DROPPING OFF MORE READILY,
AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET CAUGHT MORE OFTEN.
Man #8:
OH, SHOOT.
Douglas:
SO YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS A PERILOUS MOMENT --
GOING THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
Man #8:
OH, MY GOD.
Douglas:
AND IT'S NOT JUST ONCE OR TWICE
THE SHERPAS HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT.
IT'S UP TO 30 TRIPS PER SEASON,
AS COMPARED TO ABOUT TWO OR THREE FOR MOST FOREIGNERS.
Brice:
I'M TOTALLY SCARED EVERY TIME
I SEND THE SHERPAS UP IN THE MOUNTAIN.
IT'S LIKE SENDING THEM OFF TO WAR.
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GONNA COME HOME.
IF THERE'S AN ACCIDENT IN THE ICEFALL,
ARE WE GONNA LOSE ONE?
ARE WE GONNA LOSE TWO?
ARE WE GONNA LOSE SIX PEOPLE?
BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL IS THERE.
Douglas:
AND THE QUESTION IS --
WHAT IS THE MORAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT?
YOU KNOW, WHAT REWARD IS THERE FOR YOU TO PLAY
WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A GAME OF RUSSIAN ROULETTE?
IN 2012, I DETERMINED THE MOUNTAIN TO BE DANGEROUS.
[ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ]
EVERY NIGHT, I'D LISTEN TO THE SHERPAS
ON THE RADIO GOING THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
AND ALL THE TIME, THEY WERE RUNNING AWAY
FROM SMALL AVALANCHES AND BLOCKS OF ICE
FALLING DOWN AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
SO I MADE A DECISION TO CANCEL MY EXPEDITION.
THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY HARD THING TO DO --
TO CANCEL A COMMERCIAL EXPEDITION.
Douglas:
THERE WERE PEOPLE AROUND WHO SAID,
"WELL, RUSSELL'S, YOU KNOW, BEING A BIT OF A CHUMP HERE
BECAUSE HIS CLIENTS WILL BE PISSED OFF
BECAUSE THEY WENT HOME
AND OTHER PEOPLE GOT TO THE TOP."
I THINK RUSSELL BRICE
WAS REALLY PUTTING INTO PERSPECTIVE THE RISKS
THAT PEOPLE WERE MAKING THE SHERPAS TAKE.
NOW RUSSELL HAS FOUR OF THOSE CLIENTS
RETURNING THIS YEAR.
SO THAT ADDS A LOT OF PRESSURE FOR A SUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION.
Douglas:
TENZING NORGAY WAS A MAN
WHO WAS DETERMINED TO CHANGE HIS STARS.
AND WHEN HE REACHED THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST, HE DID THAT.
THE BRITISH COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITH SOMEONE LIKE TENZING.
HE'D BEEN TO THE MOUNTAIN SEVEN TIMES BY THAT POINT,
AND THEY BENEFITED FROM ALL THOSE YEARS
OF HIS EXPERIENCE, BUT HE WASN'T ACKNOWLEDGED.
HE WASN'T GIVEN DUE REGARD FOR WHAT HE HAD ACHIEVED.
COMING DOWN FROM THAT, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,
HE FINDS HIMSELF IN A POLITICAL FIRESTORM.
Reporter:
WHO GOT TO THE TOP FIRST?
Hunt:
TO ANYBODY WHO CLIMBS MOUNTAINS, TO ANY MOUNTAINEER,
AND I FEEL TO THOUSANDS OF OTHERS.
THE MATTER COULDN'T MATTER LESS.
Reporter #2:
WHEN TENZING NORGAY WAS ASKED HOW HE FELT,
HIS CHILLY ANSWERS HAD TO BE INTERPRETED.
Hunt:
HE'S VERY HAPPY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Reporter #2:
ALL THIS AND THE GEORGE MEDAL, TOO.
Douglas:
SO JOHN HUNT BECAME SIR JOHN HUNT,
HILLARY BECAME SIR ED HILLARY,
AND TENZING GOT THE GEORGE MEDAL.
NOW, THERE IS A SUPERIOR AWARD TO THAT -
- THE GEORGE CROSS.
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SECOND-LEVEL AWARD.
IT WAS JUST NOT RIGHT.
SO IN THE EYES OF SHERPAS,
IN THE EYES OF PEOPLE IN INDIA,
IN THE EYES OF MOST ASIANS, THEY FELT SOMEWHAT SLIGHTED
THAT HE WOULD NOT GET THE SAME KIND OF RECOGNITION
THAT HIS PARTNERS GOT.
Jamling:
MY FATHER SAID,
"I WISH I HAD NEVER CLIMBED THIS MOUNTAIN."
Douglas:
HE WAS IMMENSELY PROUD OF WHAT HE HAD ACHIEVED,
BUT I THINK HE FELT THWARTED IN A WAY.
I THINK HE FELT THAT HE HADN'T REALIZED HIMSELF
IN THE WAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE LIKED.
I THINK PARTLY IT'S BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
HE LACKED A FORMAL EDUCATION.
Steven:
THE 60-YEAR-OLD REPUTATION
OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A SHERPA IS CHANGING.
Joshi:
NOW, YOU GO TO BASE CAMP
AND MORE THAN 80% OF SHERPAS FINISH THEIR HIGH SCHOOL.
AND IF YOU GO 20 YEARS AGO,
NONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN TO HIGH SCHOOL.
BECAUSE OF THEIR EDUCATION, THEY KNOW A LOT MORE
THAN WESTERN CLIENTS THINK THEY DO.
Steven:
NOW WITH THE FACEBOOK GENERATION,
SHERPAS SEE HOW MUCH CREDIT WESTERNERS
ARE GETTING FOR A CLIMB ON EVEREST,
AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY'VE DONE MOST OF THE GRUNT WORK.
WITHOUT THE SHERPA,
THE WESTERNER WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN THERE.
AND THEY ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THAT.
AND THEY WANT EQUAL CREDIT FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS IS A...
A TENDENCY OF AGGRESSION
FROM YOUNGER SHERPAS.
SO, LAST YEAR, THERE WAS FIGHTING ON EVEREST,
AND I THINK WE WERE ALL DISAPPOINTED,
SO SAD ABOUT THAT.
Man #9:
DOZENS OF PEOPLE RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY YEAR
TRYING TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST.
THIS MORNING, SOME OF THEM SAY THEY NEARLY DIED IN A BRAWL.
Woman:
MAN VERSUS THE MOUNTAIN TO MAN VERSUS MAN.
Man #11:
THREE CLIMBERS SAY THEY FACED A HUMAN FOE.
Man #12:
THREE TOP EUROPEAN CLIMBERS
HAD TO FLEE FOR THEIR LIVES.
Man #13:
THE HIGHEST-ALTITUDE SCRAP IN HISTORY.
Man #14:
THEY JUST TRIED TO KILL US.
Man #15:
THE SHERPAS TRIED TO KILL YOU?
Man #16:
THIS ALL UNFOLDED NEAR THE SUMMIT,
AN ALTITUDE OF ROUGHLY 22,000 FEET.
Douglas:
YOU HAVE A EUROPEAN CALLING A SHERPA A...
WHICH IS, IN NEPAL, PARTICULARLY,
CULTURALLY INSENSITIVE.
Man #17:
YEP.
I COPY THAT.
I KNOW WHAT WORD YOU USED.
I DON'T LIKE THAT WORD, EITHER.
Man #18:
SHERPAS, WHO USUALLY HELP WESTERNERS SUMMIT,
TURNED AGAINST THEM.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY FOR ALL WHAT THEY SAID.
ALL THE WORDS THAT CAME OUT FROM MY MOUTH WAS WRONG.
I AM SORRY.
YES.
PLEASE.
PLEASE, NO VIOLENCE.
NO.
-HE CAME TO APOLOGIZE.
I'M SORRY.
YES, YES.
PLEASE, NO VIOLENCE.
LISTEN.
HE'S VERY SORRY.
NO!
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]
HEY!
Man #18:
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE FIGHT WAS SOMETHING PERSONAL
OR REFLECTED A GREATER DISCONTENT.
PLEASE, NO VIOLENCE.
PLEASE!
¶¶
IT'S ABOUT SHERPAS NO LONGER FEELING
THAT THEY HAVE TO BE SUBSERVIENT OR DEFERENT TO WESTERN CLIMBERS
AND NOT PLAYING OUT THAT ROLE OF THE FAITHFUL SERVANT ANYMORE.
NOT BEING THE KIND OF NICE, FRIENDLY, SMILEY PERSON
IN THE BACKGROUND.
JUST SAYING, "ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE AS GOOD AS YOU."
Brice:
I'M A LITTLE AFRAID
WHERE IT'S GOING TO LEAD IN THE FUTURE.
IT'S TOO HARD.
THE TENSION IS TOO HARD.
THE WORRY IS TOO HARD.
AND I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR THAT.
[ WIND WHISTLING ]

-GOOD MORNING.
-GOOD MORNING, MOUNT EVEREST.

OW.

¶¶
CAN I HAVE A TEA WITH NO SUGAR, PLEASE?
[ ALL CHANTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ]
[ RUMBLING ]
¶¶
Douglas:
THE REASON EVEREST TAKES EIGHT WEEKS TO CLIMB
IS THAT THE BODY NEEDS TO SLOWLY ACCLIMATIZE TO THE ALTITUDE.
Brice:
WE DO OUR ACCLIMATIZATION ON LOBUCHE PEAK
TO STAY OUT OF THE ICEFALL,
TO REDUCE THE RISK FOR OUR CLIENTS.
Douglas:
AND SO WHEN, YOU KNOW, RUSSELL BRICE
STARTS GETTING HIS CLIENTS TO CAMP ON TOP OF, YOU KNOW,
A NEARBY PEAK RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THE ICEFALL
TO ACCLIMATIZE, YOU KNOW, THAT MAKES SENSE.
THE FEWER TRIPS ANYONE HAS TO MAKE THROUGH THE ICEFALL,
THE BETTER.
MEANWHILE, THE SHERPAS ARE STILL STOCKING THE CAMPS
ON EVEREST, MAKING DOZENS OF TRIPS UP AND DOWN,
CARRYING ALL THE OXYGEN, THE TENTS, THE FOOD, SO ON.
SO THAT THE MOUNTAIN IS READY TO BE CLIMBED
WHEN THE CLIENTS RETURN.
Brice:
THIS YEAR, MY CLIENTS WILL GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL TWICE,
BUT I DARE SAY MOST OF THE SHERPAS
WILL GO THROUGH MAYBE 20 TO 30 TIMES.
AND I'M NOT SURE THE CLIENTS ACTUALLY EVER SEE THAT.
THAT WAS A NICE DAY FOR A CLIMB.
¶¶
[ LAUGHTER ]
Brice:
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE, EVEN ON OUR TRIPS,
DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
ALL THIS WORK IS GOING ON EVERY NIGHT.
LOADS OF EQUIPMENT GOING UP TO SUPPORT THEM ON THE MOUNTAIN.
BUT NOW WE HAVE TO START THE REAL JOB OF WHY WE'RE HERE,
AND THAT'S GOING UP THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN.
SAFETY IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.
IF YOU GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL WITHOUT CRAMPONS,
IF YOU GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL WITHOUT CLIPPING ON,
I'M GONNA SACK YOU.
YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME.
Douglas:
IT MUST SEEM CRAZY GOING THROUGH THE KHUMBU ICEFALL
IN THE DARK, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH SAFER
BECAUSE IT'S MORE STABLE IN THE COLD OF NIGHT.
ONCE THE SUN HITS,
IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS.
Brice:
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THAT YOU HAVE A BIG RESPONSIBILITY
NOT ONLY FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY BUT FOR YOUR FAMILY.
EVEN IF IT'S A FULL MOON, YOU MUST HAVE YOUR HEADLAMP.
THE TRANSCEIVERS MUST BE TURNED ON HERE,
AND YOU MUST USE THE TRANSCEIVER EVERY DAY
THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
WE KNOW IF A SERAC FALLS ON TOP OF YOU
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SURVIVE, BUT IF YOU HAVE A TRANSCEIVER,
IT MEANS TO FIND YOU WILL TAKE MUCH LESS TIME.
AND SO THAT PUTS THE PEOPLE DOING THE RESCUE
AT MUCH LESS RISK.

THIS MORNING, THE SEARCH HAS BEEN SUSPENDED
FOR THREE OTHER PEOPLE
WHO ARE STILL MISSING FROM MOUNT EVEREST.
CREWS DID MANAGE TO RECOVER A 13th BODY OVERNIGHT.
Wardle:
TWO DAYS AGO, 16 PEOPLE DIED
INCLUDING ABOUT HALF OF OUR TEAM.
THIS MORNING, I THINK THE SHERPAS ARE TAKING MATTERS
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.
THEY'RE HOLDING A BIG MEETING AT BASE CAMP.
WE'VE JUST BEEN TOLD THAT THE SHERPAS ARE QUITE ANGRY
AND WE SHOULD GET BAGS READY
JUST IN CASE WE HAVE TO MAKE A SWIFT EXIT.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE SHERPAS ARE PERHAPS GONNA TARGET US
AS A FOCUS FOR THEIR ANGER -- WESTERNERS COMING HERE
AND CAUSING SUCH A KIND OF CIRCUS AT TIMES.
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY STILL-LINGERING TENSION
FROM LAST YEAR AND THE FIGHTS THAT BROKE OUT.
WE'RE HOPING THE SAME THING DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN THIS YEAR,
BUT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT FILMING HERE RIGHT NOW.
[ ALL CHEER ]
[ APPLAUSE ]
[ ALL SHOUTING, CHANTING ] 16 PEOPLE DYING AT THE SAME TIME --
IT'S A HUGE, HUGE SHOCK.
WHEN IT STARTED TO SINK IN,
THE ANGER GOT DISTINCTLY POINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT.
THEY FEEL THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN BENEFITING
OFF THE LABOR OF THE SHERPAS, THE LIVES OF THE SHERPAS,
AND NEVER PUT ANYTHING BACK.
Douglas:
NEPAL'S TOURISM INDUSTRY
IS WORTH $360 MILLION A YEAR.
SO WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OFFERS THE FAMILIES AROUND $400,
WHICH ISN'T EVEN ENOUGH TO COVER THEIR FUNERAL EXPENSES,
GRIEF TURNS TO ANGER VERY QUICKLY.
[ CHEERING ]
THE GOVERNMENT -- YOU KNOW, ONCE IT FIGURED OUT
THAT IT COULD SELL EVEREST AS MANY TIMES
AS IT LIKED EVERY YEAR RATHER THAN ONCE,
IT'S BASICALLY JUST SAT THERE,
OCCASIONALLY TWIDDLED AROUND THE EDGES
WHEN THERE WAS SOME BAD HEADLINES,
BUT BASICALLY NOT REALLY DONE ANYTHING SINCE.
THEY'VE LEFT IT TO WESTERN, YOU KNOW, OPERATORS
AND JUST TAKEN THEIR CUT EVERY YEAR, AND IT'S A BIG CUT.
IT'S LIKE 1/3 OF THE MONEY
THAT STAYS IN NEPAL FROM THIS BUSINESS
GOES TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE SHERPAS -- THEY'RE STILL TAKING THE RISKS.
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE ALWAYS TAKEN THE RISKS.
THEY'RE STILL TAKING THE RISKS.
THEY, QUITE REASONABLY, THINK THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
WE WORKED REALLY HARD THIS MORNING
TO SEND A LETTER TO THE MINISTRY
ASKING FOR BETTER CONDITIONS FOR THESE GUYS.
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT MIGHT PREEMPT
THIS TYPE OF MEETING THIS AFTERNOON.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
OF COURSE WE'RE UPSET ABOUT PEOPLE DYING,
BUT THIS IS IRRATIONAL, YOU KNOW?
IT'S TOTALLY IRRATIONAL.
I DARE SAY THEY'D LOOK AT THE ARAB SUMMER
AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THINK
THAT THEY CAN DO THE SAME SORT OF THINGS.
IT'S HOT-HEADED YOUNG GUYS WHO REALLY DON'T HAVE
VERY MUCH EXPERIENCE ON THIS MOUNTAIN IN ANY CASE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THEY'RE ANGRY, YES.
THEY ARE.
THEIR GRANDPARENTS AND THEIR FATHERS
HAVE WORKED HARD IN THE HIMALAYAS.
ALL THE HARD WORK HAS BEEN DONE BY THE SHERPAS,
WHICH IS NOT FAIR.
IT IS NOT FAIR.
[ MEN SINGING SOLEMNLY ]
Man #30:
EVERY MORNING, WE WAKE UP
AND WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS NOT A DREAM.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
WE HAD A -
- A DAY --
WE'VE ALL BEEN EXPECTING AN ACCIDENT,
AND WE HAD A VERY BAD DAY.
THE DAY THAT WE NEVER, EVER WANTED.
I AM AFRAID EVERY SINGLE DAY THE BOYS GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
I FEAR EVERY DAY, BUT, GUYS, WE ALSO HAVE TO PROGRESS.
WE HAVE TO PROGRESS FOR THE FUTURE.
OTHERWISE, YOU HAVE NO INCOME FOR YOUR FAMILIES.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Douglas:
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED THAT THE SHERPAS
COULD CONTEMPLATE GIVING UP A SEASON'S EARNING
IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR POINT.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST REQUESTS
FROM THE WORKERS IN THIS BASE CAMP
IS TO NOT CONTINUE CLIMBING THIS YEAR.
WE KNOW THAT'S A GREAT BIG ASK,
BUT IT'S SOMEWHAT SMALL COMPARED TO THE 16 LIVES
WE'VE LOST IN THIS MOUNTAIN.
THIS IS NOT WORKABLE FOR US.
WE'VE STILL GOT OUR SHERPAS TO COME TO TALK TO,
TO SEE IF WE WANT TO CARRY ON CLIMBING OR NOT.
WE CAN'T HAVE THIS HAPPENING EVERY TIME
THERE'S AN ACCIDENT EVERY SEASON.
IT'S GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.
WE'RE BEING FORCED OFF THIS MOUNTAIN BY RENEGADE SHERPAS.
Joshi:
WE ONLY BECAME A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY IN THE '90s,
SO PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE MORE FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
SO WHENEVER THEY SPEAK SOMETHING THAT IS A BIT MORE BOLD,
IT OBVIOUSLY TAKES THE WESTERN PEOPLE
WHO ARE THE BASE CAMP BY SURPRISE.
THEY'RE SAYING WHAT THEY THINK.
THEY'RE NOT REBELS.
THEY'RE JUST MOUNTAIN GUIDES.
Brice:
I'M ASKING FOR A HELICOPTER
TO GO TO THE MINISTRY.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT TAKEN MUCH NOTICE IN THE PAST,
SO I THINK NOW'S THE TIME.
I THINK WE'RE CONFIDENT
THAT WE'RE GONNA RECOVER THE SITUATION,
BUT ONLY IF WE ACT RIGHT NOW.
¶¶
Man #31:
GOOD MORNING.
WELL, IT BEGAN AS A TRAGEDY
AND HAS NOW TURNED INTO AN AVALANCHE OF RESENTMENT
THAT THREATENS THE ENTIRE EVEREST INDUSTRY.
Woman #6:
SHERPA GUIDES ON MOUNT EVEREST ARE STAGING A BOYCOTT
THAT THREATENS TO SHUT DOWN NEXT MONTH'S CLIMBING SEASON.
Man #31:
THE ISSUE IS WHY THE SHERPA CLIMBING GUIDES,
WHO ASSUME A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE PART OF THE RISK
GET A DISPROPORTIONATELY SMALL PART OF THE TAKE.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON, YOU KNOW?
WE HEAR FROM, YOU KNOW --
SIMON HEARS FROM THE EUROPEAN PAPERS
THAT THE SEASON'S OVER.
I HEAR FROM AMERICAN MEDIA
THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL STRIKE
AND THERE'S STILL NEGOTIATING GOING ON, BUT...
-WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, HUH?
-NOTHING.
WE CAN SIT IT,
AND YET WE DON'T KNOW A THING.
HE'S PAID FOR A HELICOPTER TO COME AND TAKE HIM
SO WE CAN GO TALK TO THE PEOPLE THAT CAN MAKE DECISIONS.
HE'S WORKING ON IT,
AND UNTIL THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE OVER,
THERE'S NOTHING BUT SPECULATION,
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING.
SORRY, GUYS.
I MEAN, IF I HAD MORE INFORMATION,
I WOULD GIVE IT TO YOU.
I'M GOING.
THERE'S AN INHERENT RISK IN MOUNTAINEERING.
THERE'S AN INHERENT RISK IN EVEREST.
THERE'S AN INHERENT RISK IN THE KHUMBU.
I KNOW THAT.
I'M WILLING TO ASSUME THAT RISK.
McKinley:
I THINK SOME OF THE CLIENTS
ARE GETTING A LITTLE RESTLESS,
BUT I THINK WE'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
AT THE RIGHT TIME,
AND WE'RE STILL GOING FORWARD ON OUR PLAN.
SO IF THE WORD IS "YES, YOUR CREW WILL GO WITH YOU,"
WE'RE STILL GOING FORWARD.

AND EASE TENSIONS AT BASE CAMP.

THERE WAS A LOT OF EXPECTATION
SURROUNDING THE MINISTERIAL VISIT.
THE SHERPAS HOPED THEY WOULD SHOW SOME LEADERSHIP
AND CANCEL THE SEASON.

WOULD AGREE TO THE SHERPA DEMANDS
SO THE SEASON COULD CONTINUE.
Man #33:
SIT DOWN, PLEASE!
[ CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING ]
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]
[ HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING ]
Douglas:
SO IN FAILING TO ACT DECISIVELY
OR TAKE ANY KIND OF OFFICIAL POSITION,
THE GOVERNMENT HAVE REALLY LEFT THE SHERPAS
BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.
...BUT JUST COMING TO BASE CAMP, THEY DON'T MAKE MONEY.
THEY MAKE MONEY ON THE MOUNTAIN, CARRYING LOADS UP THERE.
THE HIGHER THEY GO,
THE MORE THEY CARRY, THE MORE THEY'RE PAID.
JUST COMING TO BASE CAMP, THEY MAKE NOTHING.
BUT FOR THE LAST 61 YEARS, WE'VE WAITED.
SOMETHING HAD TO HAPPEN AND THEN WE HAD TO RAISE OUR VOICE
AND TO SUCH A HUGE LOSS.
THEY'RE READY TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES.
THEY'D RATHER LEAVE THAN DIE.
Douglas:
I THINK MANY EXPEDITION LEADERS FOUND THEMSELVES
IN AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT POSITION.
BALANCING THE INTERESTS OF CLIENTS AND THE SHERPAS
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WAS NEVER GOING TO BE EASY.
Linville:
WHAT HAPPENED WAS REALLY A TRAGIC DAY,
A BLACK DAY.
I FEEL STILL POSITIVE
IF WE'RE GONNA BE ALLOWED TO GO UP THE MOUNTAIN, YOU KNOW,
AND CONTINUE THE JOURNEY AND HOPEFULLY IT'S SUCCESSFUL
AND YOU KNOW, LIFE GOES ON,
AND JUST TRY TO REMEMBER THE GUYS FOR WHAT THEY WERE
AND CARRY A POSITIVE MESSAGE.
I KNEW THE RISKS.
FROM A PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW, I WAS PREPARED TO TAKE THAT,
BUT TO ASK THE SHERPA BOYS
TO GO THROUGH IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN,
IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE.
IT'S HARD JUST TO --
NOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE FAMILIES,
THOSE BOYS.
THEY'RE DOING IT FOR US.
BUT I PUT SO MUCH WORK INTO THIS AND EFFORT.
THEN YOU START TO JUSTIFY IT.
Doyle:
FOR US, IT'S DéJà VU, ISN'T IT, JEFF?
YEAH.
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS, YOU KNOW?
THIS WAS 2012.
ACTUALLY, WHAT RUSSELL FEARED WOULD HAPPEN IN 2012
IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
TO HAVE TO COME BACK HERE A SECOND TIME
ONLY TO GET CANCELED AGAIN AND NEVER GIVEN THE SHOT IS --
YEAH, THAT'LL BE -
- THAT'LL BE DEVASTATING TO ME, I THINK.
YEAH.
Woman #5:
AS WE REPORTED EARLIER THIS WEEK,
SHERPAS ARE LEADING A BOYCOTT AFTER THAT DEADLY AVALANCHE.
Man #34:
STARTING TO MAKE CLIMBING FOR THOSE
WHO MIGHT WANT TO CONTINUE VERY, VERY CHALLENGING.
Woman #5:
MOST OF THE CLIMBERS WILL FORFEIT THE MONEY
THEY PAID FOR THE JOURNEY.
THAT CAN TOP $75,000.
I FLEW BACK AGAIN HERE THIS MORNING
TO FIND THAT I'M PROBABLY THE LAST TEAM TO DECIDE
WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUING ON THE MOUNTAIN
OR NOT.
YES, WE HAD ONE AVALANCHE.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE.
BUT THAT'S NO REASON TO STOP THE EXPEDITION.
TODAY, A DELEGATION -- THEY CAME TO THE BASE CAMP
TO TRY AND CALM THINGS DOWN.
BUT I'M AFRAID IT JUST ESCALATED THINGS.
IT DIDN'T HELP.
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ONLY A GROUP OF FOUR OR FIVE GUYS
THAT ARE CAUSING THIS PROBLEM,
BUT THEN THEY EXCITE 300-ODD GUYS,
AND WHEN YOU HAVE MOB RULE, WHAT CAN WE DO?
EFFECTIVELY,
WHAT THESE MILITANT SHERPAS ARE SAYING IS --
IF OUR SHERPAS GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL,
THEY'LL BEAT THEM UP.
THEN WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE FIGHTING ON EVEREST LAST YEAR.
WE WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME FORM OF PUNISHMENT
TO THESE GUYS.
OR WE NEED TO GET RID OF THEM, OUT OF THIS SYSTEM
SO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
YOU KNOW WHO EMPLOYS THEM, RUSS?
THESE FOUR OR FIVE?
I KNOW WHO EMPLOYS SOME OF THEM, YEAH.
AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN TALK TO THEIR OWNERS
AND -
- I MEAN, IF THIS WAS ONE OF YOUR SHERPAS,
YOU COULD HAVE THEM REMOVED FROM THE MOUNTAIN.
WELL, I WOULD.
YES.
SO...
BUT, YES.
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
THESE PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY IRRATIONAL.
THEY DON'T CARE.
NEXT WEEK OR NEXT MONTH,
THEY'LL BE AT HOME WITH NOTHING TO EAT.
WE HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE
AS OUR SHERPAS ARE STILL PREPARED TO GO UP THE MOUNTAIN.
AS FAR AS I KNOW, OUR SHERPAS WANT TO CLIMB.
BUT THEY FEAR FOR THEIR LIFE.
PHURBA WILL BE HERE EARLY TOMORROW.
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS EVERYTHING WITH HIM.
SO, SORRY, GUYS.
THAT'S IT.
¶¶
-OH, NAMASTE.
-NAMASTE.
[ MAN SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ]
HOW'S IT GOING?
OKAY.
HOW YOU DOING?

SHERPAS ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO EXPRESS THEIR EMOTIONS
VERY WILLINGLY.
SO IT'S SOMETIMES HARD TO READ THEM.

DON'T WANT YOU COMING OR --
HOW THEY WANT -- HOW THEY SAY?
THEY ARE HAPPY THAT WE'RE BACK, BUT THEY'RE STILL AFRAID --
AFRAID.
AFRAID, TOO, THAT WE'RE GOING BACK AGAIN.
YEAH.
I'M SURE.
WE'RE ALL AFRAID.
YEAH.
WE'RE ALL AFRAID, PHURBA.
SO.
WHAT TO DO.
WANT TO GO NORTH SIDE?
-STILL VERY RISKY.
-HUH?
THERE'S RISK EVERY TIME.
DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WE GO.
MM-HMM.
SO, UM...
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.
YOU WANT TO CLIMB,
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE AND EVERYTHING.
YEAH.
ALTHOUGH, I CHECKED WITH ALL THE BUDDHISTS AND HINDU.
YOU KNOW, IF WE RESPECT,
THEN WE CAN CARRY ON DOING OUR WORK,
BUT WHAT WE FEEL HERE IS DANGER
FOR YOU FROM OTHER SHERPA.
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?
-NO, I DIDN'T.
-DIDN'T HEAR THAT?
SO, FOR ME, I FEEL AFRAID FOR YOU.
WE FEEL DANGER FOR YOU GUYS IF YOU CARRY ON CLIMBING,
BUT MAYBE LATER, SOME VIOLENCE TO YOU --
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT.
'CAUSE THIS IS NOT NORMAL SHERPA.
HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL?
MAYBE YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME.
AND IF YOU'RE ANGRY, THEN YOU HAVE TO TELL ME,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I THINK PRESSURE COMING FROM OUTSIDE --
AND I'M AFRAID FOR YOU.
SO, I THINK WE HAVE TO STOP EXPEDITION.
YOU AGREE?
-MM-HMM.
YOU AGREE TO STOP EXPEDITION?
-YEAH.
-EVERYONE?
-YES.
-YEAH?
SO I HAVE TO TELL THE MEMBERS LIKE THAT?
MM-HMM.
I DON'T WANT, BUT ALSO, IF JUST US,
HOW CAN I AFFORD ALL THE ROPE?
BECAUSE I HAVE TO BUY FROM EXPEDITION OPERATORS.
SO, FOR ME, I CAN'T AFFORD JUST US.
YOU KNOW, BEFORE IT WAS ALWAYS FRIENDLY,
SMILING SHERPA, ALWAYS HELPING.
THESE GUYS HAVE SPOILED YOUR REPUTATION.
OKAY.
WHAT TO DO NOW.
I HAVE TO GO AND TELL MEMBERS WE'RE FINISHED.
MM-HMM.
YOU KNOW, MY PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU.
SAD.
GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
SO GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE.
SO, AS I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT,
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE
AND THE SHERPAS FEEL UNDER TOO MUCH THREAT.
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN TOLD IF THEY GO THROUGH ICEFALL,
THEY'LL BREAK THEIR LEGS.
SO...
THIS IS THE WORD THAT COMES TO THEM
THAT THESE OTHER GUYS UP HERE WILL BREAK THEIR LEGS
IF THEY GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
YES, THEY WANT TO CLIMB.
OUT OF RESPECT, THEY DON'T WANT TO CLIMB,
AND OUT OF FEAR, THEY DON'T WANT TO CLIMB.
NOT FEAR OF THE MOUNTAIN.
FEAR OF THE PEOPLE.
SO THERE YOU GO, GUYS.
WHAT CAN I SAY?
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
AND PHURBA DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
AND WE'RE PISSED OFF.
WE'RE ANGRY THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE RUINING OUR BUSINESS,
YOU KNOW?
THEIR BUSINESS.
WHAT CAN WE DO?
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.
I...
DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME TWICE.
OKAY.
SO, NOW HOW TO GET OUT OF HERE.
ESSENTIALLY, WE WERE JUST GIVEN THE NEWS
THAT THE SHERPAS' LEGS WOULD BE BROKEN
IF THEY WERE TO HELP US
GET UP THIS MOUNTAIN.
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY ARGUE WITH THAT ONE?
BEING HELD CAPTIVE BY TERRORISTS, IS HOW I LOOK AT IT.
I MEAN, WHEN PEOPLE DEMAND CHANGE
AND THREATEN IT BY VIOLENCE, THAT'S A TERRORIST, YOU KNOW.
AND WE IN THE STATES, WE KNOW WHAT THAT IS --
AFTER 9/11.
WE'VE GOT A GROUP HERE THAT'S TERRORIZING BASE CAMP.
HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT, YOU KNOW?
HOW DO YOU --
HOW DO YOU MENTALLY PREPARE YOURSELF
TO GET UP HERE AND THEN BE TURNED AWAY
BECAUSE A GROUP OF TERRORISTS ARE DEMANDING
THAT WESTERNERS LEAVE BASE CAMP?
YOU KNOW, IT'S -
- IT'S HARD.
DO I HAVE IT IN ME FOR A THIRD TIME
TO TRY TO COME BACK AND DO EVEREST?
I'VE GOT TO GO TALK WITH MY FAMILY, I THINK,
BEFORE I MAKE ANY FINAL DECISIONS.
BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO GET TO THE TOP
OF THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD
AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT LEGACY TO MY FAMILY
AS SOMETHING THEY --
[ Voice breaking ] NOW YOU GOT ME.
Man #34:
OH, WE'LL BE BACK.
WE'LL BE BACK HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR.
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
I'LL TACK THE TOP OF THAT MOUNTAIN AT SOME POINT,
SO...
JUST A SLIGHT SETBACK.
I'M GONNA FEEL BETTER WHEN I GO HOME KNOWING
THAT WE DIDN'T CLIMB UP THAT MOUNTAIN
AFTER THE BIG TRAGEDY.
IT'S JUST BETTER TO SHOW MY RESPECT
FOR THE SHERPA COMMUNITY BY LEAVING.
Joshi:
I THINK THE EXPEDITION ORGANIZERS --
THEY KNEW IN THEIR HEART WHAT THEIR SHERPA WANTS,
BUT THEY COULDN'T TELL THAT CLEARLY TO THEIR CLIENTS.
IT'S JUST THE EXCUSES THEY ARE USING
TO THROW THE BLAME ON SOMEBODY ELSE, YEAH.
¶¶
IF THIS DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING, THEN NOTHING EVER WILL.
THEN NEPAL WILL JUST BE LIKE THE WILD, WILD WEST
FOR THE WESTERN OPERATORS TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.
THIS THING HAS HAPPENED, WHICH IS A SAD THING,
BUT HOPEFULLY, THIS WILL BRING SOMETHING POSITIVE
INTO THE MOUNTAIN.
Brice:
IT MUST HAVE SOME EFFECT OF THE EVEREST INDUSTRY --
THE ACCIDENT THIS YEAR.
I THINK THIS MADE ME MORE DETERMINED
TO TRY AND CHANGE THE RULES
SO WE CAN CONTINUE WITH EVEREST AS USUAL BUT IN A SAFER WAY.
I'VE BEEN A MOUNTAIN GUIDE ALL MY LIFE.
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH DEATH A LOT, AND THEN TRY AND MOVE ON.
HOPEFULLY, WE WILL HAVE A TEAM
TO GO TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST AGAIN NEXT YEAR.
[ HELICOPTER WHIRRING FADES ]

Douglas:
THE GAME SHIFTED.
IT WOULD BE EASY IN THE CHAOS OF THIS LAST WEEK
TO LOSE SIGHT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE.
THE SHERPAS HAVE EFFECTIVELY CANCELED THE SEASON.
THEY HAD A CHOICE, AND IN THE END,
THEY'VE CHOSEN RESPECT FOR THEMSELVES AND THE MOUNTAIN
AHEAD OF MONEY.
CANCELING THE SEASON WILL BE A WELCOMED BREATHING SPACE.
SO MAYBE IT WILL BE CALMER.
IT WILL BE NICE FOR EVEREST TO BE CALM FOR A BIT
RATHER THAN THIS KIND OF MADNESS.
MY FATHER SAID THAT YOU DON'T CONQUER
THESE MOUNTAINS, YOU KNOW?
YOU JUST CRAWL UP,
AS A CHILD CRAWLING TO YOUR MOTHER'S LAP,
WHICH IS THE SAME APPROACH I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE.
THEN THERE'D BE LESS ACCIDENTS.
Norbu:
HE WAS THE FIRST ASIAN TO BECOME FAMOUS,
KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD,
AND HE BECAME A GREAT METAPHOR FOR YOUNG MEN
ALL ALIKE TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN,
HARD WORK IS WHAT IT TAKES.
AND SO HE BECAME A REAL SYMBOL OF HOPE
FOR MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD.
¶¶
¶¶
[ PRAYER WHEELS CLANKING ]
Douglas:
TENZING GAVE THE NAME SHERPA A CURRENCY
WHICH WILL NEVER BE EXHAUSTED.
SO IT MAY ONLY BE NOW
THAT THEY'RE REALLY BEGINNING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.
THEY'VE GOT CONTROL OF CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN,
AND IT'S COME FULL CIRCLE IN A WAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Jamling:
MY FATHER SAID HE CLIMBED
SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO.
HE WANTED TO GIVE US THE BEST EDUCATION
SO WE COULD CONTINUE OUR LIVES IN SOME OTHER CAREERS
RATHER THAN CLIMBING.
BECAUSE CLIMBING WAS DANGEROUS.

[MAN WHISTLES]
[BELLS DINGING]
Douglas:
THIS IS AN ASTONISHINGLY CHANCE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN WESTERN CLIMBERS AND THE SHERPAS.
WHEN CLIMBING BEGAN, THE SHERPAS HAD NO CONCEPTION
OF WHAT MOUNTAINEERING MIGHT BE,
AND YET, SUDDENLY THEY WERE ON THIS JOURNEY
FROM BEING PEOPLE WHO JUST GENETICALLY WERE REALLY GOOD
AT ALTITUDE TO BECOMING,
YOU KNOW, INTERNATIONAL MOUNTAIN GUIDES 100 YEARS LATER.
Man:
1953 -
- CORONATION YEAR.
THE WORLD WAS TURNED BY THE NEWS
ATTH EVEREST HAD AT LAST BEEN CONQUERED
BY A BRITISH EXPEDITION LEBYD COLONEL JOHN HUNT.
ACCOMPANIED BY THE FAMOUS SHERPA TENZING,
EDMUND HILLARY CLIMBED THE SUMMIT
OF THE WORLD'S HIGHEST MOUNTAIN.
Douglas:
WHEN TENZING NORGAY REACHED THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST,
THAT IS SUCH AN AMAZING MOMENT.
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS
IN CLIMBING HISTORY.
THAT'S THE MOMENT WHEN THE WORD "SHERPA"
HAS THE MEANING OF BRAND IN THE WAY THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT.
THE WORLD WAS CAPTIVATED BY TENZING.
AND HE FIXED IN OUR MINDS THE POPULAR IMAGE OF A SHERPA,
AS THIS SMILING, FRIENDLY, ALMOST HEROIC FIGURE.
Jamling:
A LOT OF THE WESTERN WORLD
DO NOT KNOW WHAT A SHERPA IS.
SO, A SHERPA, YOU KNOW -- YOU CLIMB MOUNTAINS, YOU KNOW?
AND THAT'S THE FIRST INSTINCT,
BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT WE ARE
ACTUALLY AN ETHNIC GROUP OF PEOPLE.
WE BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION -- LIFE AFTER DEATH.
AND YOU CONTINUE TO BE REBORN AND REBORN AND REBORN
UNTIL THE DAY YOU REACH NIRVANA.
SO, YOUR NEXT LIFE IS DETERMINED BY YOUR DEEDS OF THIS LIFE.
WE SHERPA PEOPLE HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MOUNTAIN.
Norgay:
OVER HERE, WE CLIMB MOUNTAINS,
BUT IT'S A HOLY PLACE.
THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN, YOU KNOW,
THE ATTITUDE, THE FEELING.
WESTERN PEOPLE APPROACH IT AS A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE --
PUSH YOUR LIMIT TO SEE HOW CLOSE YOU CAN GET TO DEATH.
BUT THERE'S 1,000-YEAR-OLD STORIES
WE HAVE ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN, ITS HISTORY,
WHICH THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT.
AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE ADAPT AND LEARN AND RESPECT IT.
SOME PEOPLE DON'T.
Douglas:
IF PHURBA IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CLIMBING SHERPAS
OF HIS GENERATION,
THEN HIS COUNTERPART AMONGST EXPEDITION LEADERS
IS HIS BOSS, RUSSELL BRICE.
Brice:
I'VE BEEN RUNNING COMMERCIAL EXPEDITIONS HERE
SINCE 1994.
I THINK I'M THE PERSON THAT'S BEEN
ON MORE EVEREST EXPEDITIONS THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD.
IT'S ALL OXYGEN.
- ALL OXYGEN.
AND I BROUGHT THOSE TWO BROKEN ONES IN KATHMANDU.
HOW CAN I EXPLAIN PHURBA TASHI?
THIS YEAR, HE MIGHT CLIMB EVEREST 22 TIMES --
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD --
AND SUCH A SPECIAL PERSON.
HE'S INCREDIBLY STRONG ON THE MOUNTAIN.
GOOD IDEA.
HOT WATER HERE.
EASY TO COME FROM THE KITCHEN.
HI, GUYS.
LOTS OF NEW FACES.
¶¶
[HORN HONKING]
[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING]
Douglas:
THE SERVICE-INDUSTRY ASPECT
OF CLIMBING EVEREST HAS DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPED.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
SO WHAT MOUNTAINEERS IN 1975 MAYBE WOULD HAVE PUT UP WITH,
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING NOW WANT SOMETHING A BIT MORE.
YOU KNOW, THEY WANT A VERY COMFORTABLE BASE CAMP.
EVERHIYTNG'S GOOD.
SO MUCH WORK FOR THESE GUYS
TO MAKE ALL THESE PLATFORMS AND PUT TENTS UP.
[MEN SHOUTING]
THE ACTIVITY HERE HACHS ANGED UTTERLY.
IT HAS BECOME AN INDUSTRY,
AND THAT INDUSTRY IS PEOPLE, LARGELY, BY SHERPAS.
[SINGING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE]
AND THEY MAY NOT STILL FULLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT IS THAT COMPELS US TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS,
BUT THEY ARE FANTASTICALLY GOOD AT DELIVERING THE EXPERIENCE.
[MEN SHOUTING]

IN THE OLD DAYS,
PEOPLE DID EVERYTHING ON THE MOUNTAIN TOGETHER.
AND TODAY, THE MOUNTAIN HAS CHANGED IN THAT
THE OPERATORS TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.
Brice:
IN THE OLD DAYS,
IF YOU GOT ONE PERSON ON THE SUMMIT,
THAT WAS SUCCESS.
NOW, WE NEED TO GET EVERYONE ON THE SUMMIT.
SO IF YOU WANT TO GET EVERYONE ON THE SUMMIT,
YOU NEED MUCH MORE CREATURE COMFORT.
CERTAINLY THE TYPE OF PERSON
THAT COMES ON AN EXPEDITION HAS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY.
WE BRING PEOPLE HERE TO HELP THEM FULFILL THEIR DREAMS.
HEY!
YEAH!
[CHUCKLES]
PHURBA, HOW'S IT GOING?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOU BOYS HAVE DONE HARD WORK.
OH!
HEY, PHURBA.
PETER.
HOW ARE YOU?
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S BEEN A ALGO AS A CLIMBER.
I KNOW TO A LOT OF CLIMBERS, IT MIGHT BE TRIVIAL,
BUT TO ME, BEING ON TOP OF EVEREST
IS JUST AN ACHIEVEMENT OF A DREAM.
Johnson:
PART OF THE REASON WHY YOU WANT TO COME AND CMBLI --
YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE THOSE THINGS,
SEE IF YOU CAN DO IT, SEE IF YOU CAN PHYSICALLY DO IT.
IT'S A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING.
THE TRAINING IS PHENOMENAL.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU PUT TOGETHER IN A COUPLE WEEKS.
IT'S MONTHS OF PLANNING AND MONTHS OF GETTING ORGANIZED.
[PAN CLANGING]
Man:
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A MAN SO PARTICULAR?
Man #2:
ARE YOU WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW?
Man #3:
IT'S LIKE A CAVEMAN.
Douglas:
AND SO, FOR JUST EIGHT HECTIC WEEKS EACH YEAR,
EVEREST BASE CAMP BECOMES THIS THRIVING VILLAGE.
AND IN RECENT YEARS, OVERCROWDING ON EVEREST
HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF A LOT OF CONTROVERSY.
Williams:
IT MIGHT JUST BE THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH
YOU'D EXPECT TO FIND A TRAFFIC JAM --
THE TOP OF THE WORLD -- MOUNT EVEREST.
Man #4:
THESE ARCHIVE IMAGES SHOW HOW LINEUPS
CAUSE LONG AND UNNECESSARY DELAYS.
Man #5:
MORE THAN 4,000 CLIMBERS HAVE BEEN TO THE TOP OF EVEREST.
600 PEOPLE DO IT IN A GOOD YEAR.
IT HAS BECOME A VERY NECESSARY PART OF THE NEPALESE ECONOMY.
Man #6:
EXPEDITION COMPANIES CHARGE UP TO $100,000
TO CLIENTS WANTING TO MAKE THE ASCENT.
Man #7:
CLIMBING EVEREST HAS BECOME A BUCKET LIST AMBITION
AND A MULTI-MILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY.
Douglas:
THIS IS A, YOU KNOW, BIG EMPLOYER --
LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE.
THERE ARE MORE SHERPAS WORKING ON THE MOUNTAIN NOW
THAN THERE EVER HAVE BEEN IN HISTORY.
BUT THEY ONLY GET A SMALL FRACTION OF THE PIE.
Man #5:
THE SHERPA GUIDES EARN UP TO $5,000
FOR A TWO-MONTH EXPEDITION, 10 TIMES THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PAY
IN THEIR ISOLATED HOMELAND.
Douglas:
THE WHOLE EVEREST CIRCUS
JUST SEEMS TO GET BIGGER AND BIGGER,
AND THIS SEASON IS NO EXCEPTION.
RUSSELL BRICE'S TEAM ISUS JT ONE OF 38 EXPEDITIONS
ON THE MOUNTAIN THIS YEAR.
ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE LOOKED AFTER,
AND ALL THEIR EQUIPMENT HAS TO BE MOVED UP THE MOUNTAIN.
YOU HAVE GOOGLE MAPS
PHOTOGRAPHING THE ROUTE TO THE SUMMIT.
THERE'S A HOLLYWOOD FEATURE FILM.
THERE'S EVEN A GUY IN A WINGSUIT
TRYING TO JUMP OFF THE TOP AND FLY ALL THE WAY DOWN.
Wardle:
IT'S KIND OF DAFT, BUT IN THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE,
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS THINKING OF NEW CRAZY THINGS TO DO.
Douglas:
IT'S PART OF THE DEAL NOW --
IS THAT THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF STRANGE NOTIONS
OF WHAT CAN BE DONE ON EVEREST SIMPLY TO ATTRACT ATTENTION.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
THE WAY THESE COMMERCIAL EXPEDITIONS CLIMB EVEREST
IS TO ESTABLISH A SERIES OF HIGHER AND HIGHER CAMPS,
STOCKING THEM OVER A PERIOD OF WEEKS
WITH EVERYTHING REQUIRED TO GIVE THE CLIENTS
THE BEST CHANCE OF REACHING THE SUMMIT.
[WIND HOWLING]
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T PERMIT EQUIPMENT
TO BE FLOWN UP THE MOUNTAIN,
SO EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO BUILDING THESE CAMPS
HAS TO BE CARRIED.
[MAN LAUGHS]
Douglas:
AND IT'S THE SHERSPA THAT DO THAT WORK,
INCLUDING GOING THROUGH WHAT IS ITS MOST DANGEROUS SECTION.
¶¶
IF YOU WANT TO CLIMB EVEREST FROM THE SOUTH,
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE KHUMBU ICEFALL.
McKinley:
THE KHUMBU ICEFALL IS LIKE A WATERFALL OF ICE
COMING OUT OF THE WESTERN CWM.
THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
THAT A MOUNTAINEER WOULDO G THROUGH AN ICEFALL LIKE THIS.
BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY ACCE SSON THE SOUTH SIDE TO EVEREST,
THEN PEOE PLDO WALK THROUGH THIS JUMBLE OF ICE.
THE PROBLEM WITH THE ICEFALL IS THAT IT'S UNCONTROLLABLE.
ALL THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT ARE DANGEROUS
HAVE, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF SAFETY,
HAVE BEEN IMPROVED OVER THE YEARS.
BUT THE ICEFALL REMAINS, YOU KNOW, PERILOUS.
¶¶
NOT ONLY THAT -- THERE ARE BIG BLOCKS OF ICE
FALLING DOWN WITHOUT WARNING FROM ABOVE.
YOU'RE ASKING MEN TO GO TO WORK IN A VERY DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT.
AND IT'S BECOMING MORE SO AS THE SERACS,
THESE GIANT BLOCKS OF GLACIAL ICE,
ARE AFFECTED BY THE FORCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
THEY'RE DROPPING OFF MORE READILY,
AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET CAUGHT MORE OFTEN.
SO YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS A PERILOUS MOMENT --
GOING THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
Man #8:
OH, MY GOD.
Douglas:
AND IT'S NOT JUST ONCE OR TWICE
THE SHERPAS HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT.
IT'S UP TO 30 TRIPS PER SEASON,
AS COMPARED TO ABOUT TWO OR THREE FOR MOST FOREIGNERS.
Brice:
I'M TOTALLY SCARED EVERY TIME
I SEND THE SHERPAS UP IN E THMOUNTAIN.
IT'S LIKE SENDING THEM OFF TO WAR.
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GONNA COME HOME.
IF THERE'S AN ACCIDENT IN THE ICEFALL,
ARE WE GONNA LOSE ONE?
ARE WE GONNA LOSE TWO?
ARE WE GONNA LOSE SIX PEOPLE?
BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL IS THERE.
Douglas:
AND THE QUESTION IS --
WHAT IS THE MORAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT?
YOU KNOW, WHAT REWARD IS THERE FOR YOU TO PLAY
WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A GAME OF RUSSIAN ROULETTE?
Douglas:
TENZING NORGAY WAS A MAN
WHO WAS DETERMINED TO CHANGE HIS STARS.
AND WHEN HE REACHED THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST, HE DID THAT.
THE BRITISH COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITH SOMEONE LIKE TENZING.
HE'D BEEN TO THE MOUNTAIN SEVEN TIMES BY THAT POINT,
AND THEY BENEFITED FROM A TLLHOSE YEARS
OF HIS EXPERIENCE, BUT HE WASN'T ACKNOWLEDGED.
HE WASN'T GIVEN DUE REGARD FOR WHAT HE HAD ACHIEVED.
COMING DOWN FROM THAT, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,
HE FINDS HIMSELF IN A POLITICAL FIRESTORM.
Reporter:
WHO GOT TOHE T TOP FIRST?
Hunt:
TO ANYBODY WHO CLIMBS MOUNTAINS, TO ANY MOUNTAINEER,
AND I FEEL TO THOUSANDS OF OTHERS.
THE MATTER COULDN'T MATTER LESS.
Reporter #2:
WHEN TENZING NORGAY WAS ASKED HOW HE FELT,
HIS CHILLY ANSWERS HAD TO BE INTERPRETED.
Hunt:
HE'S VERY HAPPY.
[LAUGHTER]
Reporter #2:
ALL THIS AND THE GEORGE MEDAL, TOO.
Douglas:
SO JOHN HUNT BECAME SIR JOHN HUNT,
HILLARY BECAME SIR ED HILLARY,
AND TENZING GOT THE GEORGE MEDAL.
NOW, THERE IS A SUPERIOR AWARD TO THAT -
- THE GEORGE CROSS.
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SECOND-LEVEL AWARD.
IT WAS JUST NOT RIGHT.
SO IN THE EYES OF SHERPAS,
IN THE EYES OF PEOPLE IN INDIA,
IN THE EYES OF MOST ASIANS, THEY FELT SOMEWHAT SLIGHTED
THAT HE WOULD NOT GET THE SAME KIND OF RECOGNITION
THAT HIS PARTNERS GOT ON EVEREST.
Douglas:
HE WAS IMMENSELY PROUD OF WHAT HE HAD ACHIEVED,
BUT I THINK HE FELT THWARTED IN A WAY.
I THINK HE FELT THAT HE HADN'T REALIZED HIMSELF
IN THE WAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE LIKED.
I THINK PARTLY IT'S BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
HE LACKEA D FORMAL EDUCATION.
Steven:
THE 60-YEAR-OLD REPUTATION
OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A SHERPA IS CHANGING.
Joshi:
NOW, YOU GO TO BASE CAMP
AND MORE THAN 80 % OF SHERPAS FINISH THEIR HIGH SCHOOL.
AND IF YOU GO 20 YEARS AGO,
NONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN TO HIGH SCHOOL.
BECAUSE OF THEIR EDUCATION, THEY KNOW A LOT MORE
THAN WESTERN CLIENTS THINK THEY DO.
Steven:
NOW WITH THE FACEBOOK GENERATION,
SHERPAS SEE HOW MUCH CREDIT WESTERNERS
ARE GETTING FOR A CLIMB ON EVEREST,
AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY'VE DONE MOST OF THE GRUNT WORK.
WITHOUT THE SHERPA,
THE WESTERNER WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN THERE.
AND THEY ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THAT.
AND THEY WANT EQUAL CREDIT FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS IS A...
A TENDENCY OF AGGRESSION
FROM YOUNGER SHERPAS.
SO, LAST YEAR, THERE WAS FIGHTING ON EVEREST,
AND I THINK WE WERE ALL DISAPPOINTED,
SO SAD ABOUT THAT.
Man #9:
DOZENS OF PEOPLE RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY YEAR
TRYING TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST.
THIS MORNING, SOME OF THEM SAY THEY NEARLY DIED IN A BRAWL.
Woman:
MAN VERSUS THE MOUNTAIN TO MAN VERSUS MAN.
Man #11:
THREE CLIMBERS SAY THEY FACED A HUMAN FOE.
Man #12:
THREE TOP EUROPEAN CLIMBERS
HAD TO FLEE FOR THEIR LIVES.
Man #13:
THE HIGHEST-ALTITUDE SCRAP IN HISTORY.
Man #14:
THIS ALL UNFOLDED NEAR THE SUMMIT,
AT AN ALTITUDE OF ROUGHLY 22,000 FEET.
Douglas:
YOU HAVE A EUROPEAN CALLING A SHERPA A...
WHICH IS, IN NEPAL, PARTICULARLY,
CULTURALLY INSENSITIVE.
Man #15:
YEP.
I COPY THAT.
I KNOW WHAT WORD YOU USED.
I DON'T LIKE THAT WORD, EITHER.
Man #16:
SHERPAS, WHO USUALLY HELP WESTERNERS SUMMIT,
TURNED AGAINST THEM.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY FOR ALL WHAT THEY SAID.
ALL THE WORDS THAT CAME OUT FROM MY MOUTH WAS WRONG.
I AM SORRY.
YES.
PLEASE.
PLEASE, NO VIOLENCE.
NO.
- HE CAME TO APOLOGIZE.
I'M SORRY.
YES, YES.
PLEASE, NO VIOLENCE.
LISTEN.
HE'S VERY SORRY.
NO!
[INSTDIINCT SHOUTING]
INSIDE, INSIDE.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]
HEY!
Man #17:
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE FIGHT WAS SOMETHING PERSONAL
OR REFLECTED A GREATER DISCONTENT.
PLEASE, NO VIOLENCE.
PLEASE!
¶¶
IT'S ABOUT SHERPAS NO LONGER FEELING
THAT THEY HAVE TO BE SUBSERVIENT OR DEFERENT TO WESTERN CLIMBERS
AND NOT PLAYING OUT THAT ROLE OF THE FAITHFUL SERVANT ANYMORE.
NOT BEING THE KIND OF NICE, FRIENDLY, SMILEY PERSON
IN THE BACKGROUND.
JUST SAYING, "ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE AS GOOD AS YOU."
Brice:
I'M A LITTLE AFRAID
WHERE IT'S GOING TO LEAD IN THE FUTURE.
IT'S TOO HARD.
THE TENSION IS TOO HARD.
THE WORRY IS TOO HARD.
AND I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR THAT.
[WIND WHISTLING]

- GOOD MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING, MOUNT EVEREST.

¶¶
CAN I HAVE A TEA WITH NO SUGAR, PLEASE?
[ALL CHANTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE]
[RUMBLING]
¶¶
Douglas:
THE REASON EVEREST TAKES EIGHT WEEKS TO CLIMB
IS THAT THE BODY NEEDS TO SLOWLY ACCLIMATIZE TO THE ALTITUDE.
Brice:
WE DO OUR ACCLIMATIZATION ON LOBUCHE PEAK
TO STAY OUT OF THE ICEFALL,
TO REDUCE THE RISK FOR OUR CLIENTS.
Douglas:
AND SO WHEN, YOU KNOW, RUSSELL BRICE
STARTS GETTING HIS CLIENTS TO CAMP ON TOP OF, YOU KNOW,
A NEARBY PEAK RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THE ICEFALL
TO ACCLIMATIZE, YOU KNOW, THAT MAKES SENSE.
THE FEWER TRIPS ANYONE HAS TO MAKE THROUGH THE ICEFALL,
THE BETTER.
MEANWHILE, THE SHERPAS ARE STILL STOCKING THE CAMPS
ON EVEREST, MAKING DOZENS OF TRIPS UP AND DOWN,
CARRYING ALL THE OXYGEN, THE TES, NT THE FOOD, SO ON.
SO THAT THE MOUNTAIN IS READY TO BE CLIMBED
WHEN THE CLIENTS RETURN.
Brice:
THIS YEAR, MY CLIENTS WILL GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL TWICE,
BUT I DARESAY MOST OF THE SHERPAS
WILL GO THROUGH MAYBE 20 TO 30 TIMES.
AND I'M NOT SURE THE CLIENTS ACTUALLY ER VESEE THAT.
THAT WAS A NICE DAY FO R A CLIMB.
¶¶
[LAUGHTER]
Brice:
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE, EVEN ON OUR TRIPS,
DON'RET ALLY UNDERSTAND
ALL THIS WORK IS GOING ON EVERY NIGHT.
LOADS OF EQUIPMENT GOING UP TO SUPPORT THEM ON THE MOUNTAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT NOW WE HAVE TO START THE REAL JOB OF WHY WE'RE HERE,
AND THAT'S GOING UP TH ROUGH THE MOUNTAIN.
SAFETY IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.
IF YOU GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL WITHOUT CRAMPONS,
IF YOU GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL WITHOUT CLIPPING ON,
I'M GONNA SACK YOU.
YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE A BIG RESPONSIBILITY
NOT ONLY FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, BUT FOR YOUR FAMILY.
EVEN IF IT'S A FULL MOON, YOU MUST HAVE YOUR HEADLAMP.
THE TRANSCEIVERS MUST BE TURNED ON HERE,
AND YOU MUST USE THE TRANSCEIVER...
EVERY DAY THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
WE KNOW IF A SERAC FALLS ON TOP OF YOU
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SURVIVE, BUT IF YOU HAVE A TRANSCEIVER,
IT MEANS TO FIND YOU WILL TAKE MUCH LESS TIME.
AND SO THAT PUTS THE PEOPLE DOING THE RESCUE
AT MUCH LESS RISK.

MICHAEL HAS DONE AN EXAMINATION ON ALL BODIES.
NO SIGNS OF LIFE.
Brice:
I DARESAY --
THIS IS THE DAY THAT WE JUST ALL DREADED.
Woman #3:
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
[Voice breaking] SHATTERED.
EVERY VILLAGE WILL BE AFFECTED.
A LOT OF OUR GUYS WILL HAVE FRIENDS THEY KNOW.
THERE'S PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE KHUMBU.
Man #25:
NOW TO THE WORST DISASTER EVER SEEN ON MOUNT EVEREST.
Woman #4:
THE AVALANCHE HIT
AT ABOUT 6:30 THIS MORNING LOCAL TIME
AT ONE OF THE BUSIEST TIMES OF DAY ON THE MOUNTAIN.
Man #25:
GREATEST ONE-DAY TOLL RECORDED
ON THE WORLD'S TALLEST MOUNTAIN.
Woman #4:
A WALL OF SNOW CRASHED OVER THE WESTERN SHOULDER.
Man #26:
THE DEATH TOLL'S EXPECTED TO RISE TO 16.
Man #27:
QUESTIONS ARE NOW BEING ASKED ABOUT THE FUTURE
OF THIS YEAR'S CLIMBING SEASON
AND WHETHER ATTEMPTS WILL BE MADE NEXT MONTH.
Man #28:
THIS TRAGEDY ADDS TO THE DEATH TOLL ON EVEREST,
WHICH IS ALREADY ESTIMATED AT 250.
Man #29:
A FOUR-DAY HALT TO CLIMBING HAS BEEN DECLARED
WHILE THE SEARCH FOR THE MISSING SHERPAS GOES ON.

Douglas:
YOU SEE THE GRIEF,
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S GOING BACK DECADES.
YOU KNOW, THESE GRIEVING SHERPA FAMILIES --
THIS CONSTANT NARRATIVE OF LOSS BEING EXPRESSED AGAIN.
[ALL CHANTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE]
¶¶
Woman #5:
THIS MORNING, THE SEARCH HAS BEEN SUSPENDED
FOR THREE OTHER PEOPLE
WHO ARE STILL MISSING FROM MOUNT EVEREST.
CREWS DID MANAGE TO RECOVER A 13th BODY OVERNIGHT.
Wardle:
TWO DAYS AGO, 16 PEOPLE DIED
INCLUDING ABOUT HALF OF OUR TEAM.
THIS MORNING, I THINK THE SHERPAS ARE TAKING MATTERS
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.
THEY'RE HOLDING A BIG MEETING AT BASE CAMP.
WE'VE JUST BEEN TOLD THAT THE SHERPAS ARE QUITE ANGRY
AND WE SHOULD GET BAGS READY
JUST IN CASE WE HAVE TO MAKE A SWIFT EXIT.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE SHERPAS ARE PERHAPS GONNA TARGET US
AS A FOCUS FOR THEIR ANGER -- WESTERNERS COMING HERE
AND CAUSING SUCH A KIND OF CIRCUS AT TIMES.
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY STILL-NGLIERING TENSION
FROM LAST YEAR AND THE FIGHTS THAT BROKE OUT.
WE'RE HOPING THE SAME THING DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN THIS YEAR,
BUT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT FILMING HERE RIGHT NOW.
[ALL CHEER]
[APPLAUSE]
[ALL SHOUTING, CHANTING]
16 PEOPLE DYING AT THE SAME TIME --
IT'S A HUGE, HUGE SHOCK.
WHEN IT STARTED TO SINK IN,
THE ANGER GOT DISTINCTLY POINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT.
THEY FEEL THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN BENEFITING
OFF THE LABOR OF THE SHERPAS, THE LIVES OF THE SHERPAS,
AND NEVER PUT ANYTHING BACK.
Douglas:
NEPAL'S TOURISM INDUSTRY
IS WORTH $360 MILLION A YEAR.
SO WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OFFERS THE FAMILIES AROUND $400,
WHICH ISN'T EVEN ENOUGH TO COVER THEIR FUNERAL EXPENSES,
GRIEF TURNS TO ANGER VERY QUICKLY.
[CHEERING]
THE GOVERNMENT -- YOU KNOW, ONCE IT FIGURED OUT
THAT IT COULD SELL EVEREST AS MANY TIMES
AS IT LIKED EVERY YEAR RATHER THAN ONCE,
IT'S BASICALLY JUST SAT THERE,
OCCASIONALLY TWIDDLED AROUND THE EDGES
WHEN THERE WAS SOME BAD HEADLINES,
BUT BASICALLY NOT REALLY DONE ANYTHING SINCE.
THEY'VE LEFT IT TO WESTERN, YOU KNOW, OPERATORS
AND JUST TAKEN THEIR CUT EVERY YEAR, AND IT'S A BIG CUT.
IT'S LIKE 1/3 OF THE MONEY
THAT STAYS IN NEPAL FROM THIS BUSINESS
GOES TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE SHERPAS -- THEY'RE STILL TAKING THE RISKS.
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE ALWAYS TAKEN THE RISKS.
THEY'RE STILL TAKING THE RISKS.
THEY, QUITE REASONABLY, THINK THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
WE WORKED REALLY HARD THIS MORNING
TO SEND A LETTER TO THE MINISTRY
ASKING FOR BETTER CONDITIONS FOR THESE GUYS.
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT MIGHT PREEMPT
THIS TYPE OF MEETING THIS AFTERNOON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
OF COURSE WE'RE UPSET ABOUT PEOPLE DYING,
BUT THIS IS IRRATIONAL, YOU KNOW?
IT'S TOTALLY IRRATIONAL.
I DARESAY THEY'D LOOK AT THE ARAB SUMMER
AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THINK
THAT THEY CAN DO THE SAME SORT OF THINGS.
IT'S HOTHEADED YOUNG GUYS WHO REALLY DON'T HAVE
VERY MUCH EXPERIENCE ON THIS MOUNTAIN IN ANY CASE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THEY'RE ANGRY, YES.
THEY ARE.
THEIR GRANDPARENTS AND THEIR FATHERS
HAVE WORKED HARD IN THE HIMALAYAS.
ALL THE HARD WORK HAS BEEN DONE BY THE SHERPAS,
WHICH IS NOT FAIR.
IT IS NOT FAIR.
[MEN SINGING SOLEMNLY]
Man #30:
EVERY MORNING, WE WAKE UP
AND WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS NOT A DREAM.
[CHEE ARSND APPLAUSE]
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
WE HAD A -
- A DAY --
THE DAY THAT WE NEVER, EVER WANTED.
EVERY SINGLE DAY, THE BOYS GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
I FEAR EVERY DAY, BUT, GUYS, WE ALSO HAVE TO PROGRESS
. EVERY SINGLE DAY, THE BOYS GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
WE HAVE TO PROGRESS FOR THE FUTURE.
OTHERWISE, YOU HAVE NO INCOME FOR YOUR FAMILIES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Douglas:
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED THAT THE SHERPAS
COULD CONTEMPLATE GIVING UP A SEASON'S EARNING
IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR POINT.
THIS IS NOT WORKABLE FOR US.
WE'VE STILL GOT OUR SHERPAS TO COME TO TALK TO,
TO SEE IF WE WANT TO CARRY ON CLIMBING OR NOT.
WE CAN'T HAVE THIS HAPPENING EVERY TIME
THERE'S AN ACCIDENT EVERY SEASON.
IT'S GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.
Joshi:
WE ONLY BECAME A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY IN THE '90s,
SO PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE MORERE FEDOM OF SPEECH.
SO WHENEVER THEY SPEAK SOMETHING THAT IS A BIT MORE BOLD,
IT OBVIOUSLY TAKES THE WESTERN PEOPLE
WHO ARE THE BASE CAMP BY SURPRISE.
THEY'RE SAYING WHAT THEY THINK.
THEY'RE NOT REBELS.
THEY'RE JUST MOUNTAIN GUIDES.
Brice:
I'M ASKING FOR A HELICOPTER
TO GO TO THE MINISTRY.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT TAKEN MUCH NOTICE IN THE PAST,
SO I THINK NOW'S THE TIME.
I THINK WE'RE COIDNFENT
THAT WE'RE GONNA RECOVER THE SITUATION,
BUT ONLY IF WE ACT RIGHT NOW.
¶¶
Man #31:
GOOD MORNING.
WELL, IT BEGAN AS A TRAGEDY
AND HAS NOW TURNED INTO AN AVALANCHE OF RESENTMENT
THAT THREATENS THE ENTIRE EVEREST INDUSTRY.
Woman #6:
SHERPA GUIDES ON MOUNT EVEREST ARE STAGING A BOYCOTT
THAT THREATENS TO SHUT DOWN NEXT MONTH'S CLIMBING SEASON.
Man #31:
THE ISSUE IS WHY THE SHERPA CLIMBING GUIDES,
WHO ASSUME A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE PART OF THE RISK
GET A DISPROPORTIONATELY SMALL PART OF THE TAKE.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON, YOU KNOW?
WE HEAR FROM, YOU KNOW --
SIMON HEARS FROM THE EUROPEAN PAPERS
THAT THE SEASON'S OVER.
I HEAR FROM AMERICAN MEDIA
THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL STRIKE
AND THERE'S STILL NEGOTIATING GOING ON, BUT...
- WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, HUH?
- NOTHING.
WE CAN SIT IT,
AND YET WE DON'T KNOW A THING.
HE'S PAID FOR A HELICOPTER TO COME AND TAKE HIM
SO WE CAN GO TALK TO THE PEOPLE THAT CAN MAKE DECISIONS.
HE'S WORKING ON IT,
AND UNTIL THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE OVER,
THERE'S NOTHING BUT SPECULATION,
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING.
SORRY, GUYS.
I MEAN, IF I HAD MORE INFORMATION,
I WOULD GIVE IT TO YOU.
I'M GOING.
THERE'S AN INHERENT RISK IN MOUNTAINEERING.
THERE'S AN INHERENT RISK IN EVEREST.
THERE'S AN INHERENT RISK IN THE KHUMBU.
I KNOW THAT.
I'M WILLING TO ASSUME THAT RISK.
McKinley:
I THINK SOME OF THE CLIENTS
ARE GETTING A LITTLE RESTLESS,
BUT I THINK WE'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
AT THE RIGHT TIME,
AND WE'RE STILL GOING FORWARD ON OUR PLAN.
SO IF THE WORD IS "YES, YOUR CREW WILL GO WITH YOU,"
WE'RE STILL GOING FORWARD.
¶¶
Man #32:
THE FUTURE OF THE EVEREST CLIMBING SEASON
IS HANGING IN THE BALANCE THIS MORNING.
Woman #7:
NEPALESE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE FLYING INTO TRY
AND EASE TENSIONS AT BASE CAMP.
Douglas:
THERE WAS A LOT OF EXPECTAONTI
SURROUNDING THE MINISTERIAL VISIT.
THE SHERPAS HOPED THEY WOULD SHOW SOME LEADERSHIP
AND CANCEL THE SEASON.
THE CLIENTS HOPED THE GOVERNMENT
WOULD AGREE TO THE SHERPA DEMANDS
SO THE SEASON COULD CONTINUE.
Man #33:
SIT DOWN, PLEASE!
[CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]
[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING]
Douglas:
SO IN FAILING TO ACT DECISIVELY
OR TAKE ANY KIND OF OFFICIAL POSITION,
THE GOVERNMENT HAVE REALLY LEFT THE SHERPAS
BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.
...BUT JUST COMING TO BASE CAMP, THEY DON'T MAKE MONEY.
THEY MAKE MONEY ON THE MOUNTAIN, CARRYING LOADS UP THERE.
THE HIGHER THEY GO,
THE MORE THEY CARRY, THE MORE THEY'RE PAID.
JUST COMING TO BASE CAMP, THEY MAKE NOTHING.
BUT FOR THE LAST 61 YEARS, WE'VE WAITED.
SOMETHING HAD TO HAPPEN AND THEN WE HAD TO RAISE OUR VOICE
AND TO SUCH A HUGE LOSS.
THEY'RE ADREY TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES.
THEY'D RATHER LEAVE THAN DIE.
Douglas:
I THINK MANY EXPEDITION LEADERS FOUND THEMSELVES
IN AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT POSITION.
BALANCING THE INTERESTS OF CLIENTS AND THE SHERPAS
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WAS NEVER GOING TO BE EASY.
Linville:
WHAT HAPPENED WAS REALLY A TRAGIC DAY,
A BLACK DAY.
I FEEL STILL POSITIVE
IF WE'RE GONNA BE ALLOWED TO GO UP THE MOUNTAIN, YOU KNOW,
AND CONTINUE THE JOURNEY AND HOPEFULLY IT'S SUCCESSFUL
AND, YOU KNOW, LIFE GOES ON,
AND JUST TRY TO REMEMBER THE GUYS FOR WHAT THEY WERE
AND CARRY A POSITIVE MESSAGE.
I KNEW THE RISKS.
FROM A PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW, I WAS PREPARED TO TAKE THAT,
BUT TO ASK THE SHERPA BOYS
TO GO THROUGH IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN,
IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE.
IT'S HARD JUST TO --
NOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE FAMILIES,
THOSE BOYS.
THEY'RE DOING IT FOR US.
BUT I PUT SO MUCH WORK INTO THIS AND EFFORT.
THEN YOU START TO JUSTIFY IT.
Woman #5:
AS WE REPORTED EARLIER THIS WEEK,
SHERPAS ARE LEADING A BOYCOTT AFTER THAT DEADLY AVALANCHE.
Man #34:
STARTING TO MAKE CLIMBING FOR THOSE
WHO MIGHT WANT TO CONTINUE VERY, VERY CHALLENGING AND DIFFICULT.
Woman #5:
MOST OF THE CLIMBERS WILL FORFEIT THE MONEY
THEY PAID FOR THE JOURNEY.
THAT CAN TOP $75,000.
I FLEW BACK AGAIN HERE THIS MORNING
TO FIND THAT I'M PROBABLY THE LAST TEAM TO DECIDE
WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUING ON THE MOUNTAIN
OR NOT.
YES, WE HAD ONE AVALANCHE.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE.
BU T THAT'S NO REASON TO STOP THE EXPEDITION.
TODAY, A DELEGATION -- THEY CAME TO THE BASE CAMP
TO TRY AND CALM THINGS DOWN.
BUT I'M AFRAID IT JUST ESCALATED THINGS.
IT DIDN'T HELP.
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ONLY A GROUP OF FOUR OR FIVE GUYS
THAT ARE -- THAT ARE CAUSING THIS PROBLEM,
BUT THEN THEY EXCITE 300-ODD GUYS,
AND WHEN YOU HAVE MOB RULE, WHAT CAN WE DO?
EFFECTIVELY,
WHAT THESE MILITANT SHERPAS ARE SAYING IS --
IF OUR SHERPAS GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL,
THEY'LL BEAT THEM UP.
THEN WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE FIGHTING ON EVEREST LAST YEAR.
WE WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME FORM OF PUNISHMENT
TO THESE GUYS.
OR WE NEED TO GET RID OF THEM, OUT OF THIS SYSTEM
SO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
YOU KNOW WHO EMPLOYS THEM, RUSS?
THESE FOUR OR FIVE?
I KNOW WHO EMPLOYS SOME OF THEM, YEAH.
AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN TALK TO THEIR OWNERS
AND -
- I MEAN, IF THIS WAS ONE OF YOUR SHERPAS,
YOU COULD HAVE THEM REMOVED FROM THE MOUNTAIN.
WELL, I WOULD.
YES.
SO...
BUT, YES.
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
THESE PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY IRRATIONAL.
THEY DON'T CARE.
NEXT WEEK OR NEXT MONTH,
THEY'LL BE AT HOME WITH NOTHING TO EAT.
WE HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE
AS OUR SHERPAS ARE STILL PREPARED TO GO UP THE MOUNTAIN.
AS FAR AS I KNOW, OUR SHERPAS WANT TO CLIMB.
BUT THEY FEAR FOR THEIR LIFE.
PHURBA WILL BE HERE EARLY TOMORROW.
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS EVERYTHING WITH HIM.
SO, SORRY, GUYS.
THAT'S IT.
¶¶
- OH, NAMASTE.
- NAMASTE.
[MAN SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE]
HOW'S IT GOING?
OKAY.
HOW YOU DOING?
Douglas:
SHERPAS ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO EXPRESS THEIR EMOTIONS
VERY WILLINGLY.
SO IT'S SOMETIMES HARD TO READ THEM.
LOTS OF ATTENTION ON YOU NOW.
IT'S OKAY.
JUST RELAX.
LET'S HAVE A CUP OF TEA FIRST, HUH?
NAMASTE.
SO, HOW'S EVERYONE AT HOME?
UPSET?
- A BIT UPSET.
- YEAH.
I KNOW.
JUST --
UNDERSTANDABLY, YOU KNOW.
MM-HMM.
AND WIVES.
HOW DO WIVES FEEL?
DON'T WANT YOU COMING OR --
HOW THEY WANT -- HOW THEY SAY?
THEY ARE HAPPY THAT WE'RE BACK, BUT THEY'RE STILL AFRAID --
AFRAID.
AFRAID, TOO, THAT WE'RE GOING BACK AGAIN.
YEAH.
I'M SURE.
WE'RE ALL AFRAID.
YEAH.
WE'RE ALL AFRAID, PHURBA.
SO.
WHAT TO DO.
WANT TO GO NORTH SIDE?
- STILL VERY RISKY.
- HUH?
THERE'S RISK EVERY TIME.
DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WE GO.
MM-HMM.
SO, UM...
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.
YOU WANT TO CLIMB,
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE AND EVERYTHING.
YEAH.
ALTHOUGH, I CHECKED WITH ALL THE BUDDHISTS AND HINDU.
YOU KNOW, IF WE RESPECT,
THEN WE CAN CARRY ON DOING OUR WORK,
BUT WHAT WE FEEL HERE IS DANGER
FOR YOU FROM OTHER SHERPA.
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?
- NO, I DIDN'T.
- DIDT N'HEAR THAT?
SO, FOR ME, I FEEL AFRAID FOR YOU.
WE FEEL DANGER FOR YOU GUYS IF YOU CARRY ON CLIMBING,
BUT MAYBE LATER, SOME VIOLENCE TO YOU --
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT.
'CAUSE THIS IS NOT NORMAL SHERPA.
HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL?
MAYBE YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME.
AND IF YOU'RE ANGRY, THEN YOU HAVE TO TELL ME
, MAYBE YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I THINK PRESSURE COMING FROM OUTSIDE --
AND I'M AFRAID FOR YOU.
SO, I THINK WE HAVE TO STOP EXPEDITION.
YOU AGREE?
- MM-HMM.
YOU AGREE TO STOP EXPEDITION?
- YEAH.
- EVERYONE?
- YES.
- YEAH?
SO I HAVE TO TELL THE MEMBERS LIKE THAT?
MM-HMM.
I DON'T WANT, BUT ALSO, IF JUST US,
HOW CAN I AFFORD ALL THE ROPE?
BECAUSE I HAVE TO BUY FROM EXPEDITION OPERATORS.
SO, FOR ME, I CAN'T AFFORD JUST US.
YOU KNOW, BEFORE IT WAS ALWAYS FRIENDLY,
SMILING SHERPA, ALWAYS HELPING.
THESE GUYS HAVE SPOILED YOUR REPUTATION.
OKAY.
WHAT TO DO NOW.
I HAVE TO GO AND TELL MEMBERS WE'RE FINISHED.
MM-HMM.
YOU KNOW, MY PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU.
SAD.
GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
SO GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE.
SO, AS I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT,
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE
AND THE SHERPAS FEEL UNDER TOO MUCH THREAT.
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN TOLD IF THEY GO THROUGH ICEFALL,
THEY'LL BREAK THEIR LEGS.
SO...
THIS IS THE WORD THAT COMES TO THEM
THAT THESE OTHER GUYS UP HERE WILL BREAK THEIR LEGS
IF THEY GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
YES, THEY WANT TO CLIMB.
OUT OF RESPECT, THEY DON'T WANT TO CLIMB,
AND OUT OF FEAR, THEY DON'T WANT TO CLIMB.
NOT FEAR OF THE MOUNTAIN.
FEAR OF THE PEOPLE.
SO THERE YOU GO, GUYS.
WHAT CAN I SAY?
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
AND PHURBA DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
AND WE'RE PISSED OFF.
WE'RE ANGRY THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE RUINING OUR BUSINESS,
YOU KNOW?
THEIR BUSINESS.
WHAT CAN WE DO?
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.
I...
DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
OKAY.
SO, NOW HOW TO GET OUT OF HERE.
ESSENTIALLY, WE WERE JUST GIVEN THE NEWS
THAT THE SHERPAS' LEGS WOULD BE BROKEN
IF THEY WERE TO HELP US
GET UP THIS MOUNTAIN.
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY ARGUE WITH THAT ONE?
BEING HELD CAPTIVE BY TERRORISTS, IS HOW I LOOK AT IT.
I MEAN, WHEN PEOPLE DEMAND CHANGE
AND THREATEN IT BY VIOLENCE, THAT'S A TERRORIST, YOU KNOW?
AND WE IN THE STATES, WE KNOW WHAT THAT IS --
AFTER 9/11.
WE'VE GOT A GROUP HERE THAT'S TERRORIZING BASE CAMP.
HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT, YOU KNOW?
HOW DO YOU --
HOW DO YOU MENTALLY PREPARE YOURSELF
TO GET UP HERE AND THEN BE TURNED AWAY
BECAUSE A GROUP OF TERRORISTS ARE DEMANDING
THAT WESTERNERS LEAVE BASE CAMP?
YOU KNOW, IT'S -
- IT'S HARD.
I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO GET TO THE TOP
OF THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD
AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT LEGACY TO MY FAMILY
AS SOMETHING THEY --
[Voice breaking] NOW YOU GOT ME.
Man #34:
OH, WE'LL BE BACK.
WE'LL BE BACK HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR.
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
I'LL TACK THE TOP OF THAT MOUNTAIN AT SOME POINT,
SO...
JUST A SLIGHT SETBACK.
I'M GONNA FEEL BETTER WHEN I GO HOME KNOWING
THAT WE DIDN'T CLIMB UP THAT MOUNTAIN
AFTER THE BIG TRAGEDY.
IT'S JUST BETTER TO SHOW MY RESPECT
FOR THE SHERPA COMMUNITY BY LEAVING.
Joshi:
I THINK THE EXPEDITION ORGANIZERS --
THEY KNEW IN THEIR HEART WHAT THEIR SHERPA WANTS,
BUT THEY COULDN'T TELL THAT CLEARLY TO THEIR CLIENTS.
IT'S JUST THE EXCUSES THEY ARE USING
TO THROW THE BLAME ON SOMEBODY ELSE, YEAH.
¶¶
IF THIS DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING, THEN NOTHING EVER WILL.
THEN NEPAL WILL JUST BE LIKE THE WILD, WILD WEST
FOR THE WESTERN OPERATORS TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.
THIS THING HAS HAPPENED, WHICH IS A SAD THING,
BUT HOPEFULLY, THIS WILL BRING SOMETHING POSITIVE
INTO THE MOUNTAIN.
Brice:
IT MUST HAVE SOME EFFECT OF THE EVEREST INDUSTRY --
THE ACCIDENT THIS YEAR.
I THINK THIS MADE ME MORE DETERMINED
TO TRY AND CHANGE THE RULES
SO WE CAN CONTINUE WITH EVEREST AS USUAL BUT IN A SAFER WAY.
I'VE BEEN A MOUNTAIN GUIDE ALL MY LIFE.
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH DEATH A LOT, AND THEN TRY AND MOVE ON.
HOPEFULLY, WE WILL HAVE A TEAM
TO GO TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST AGAIN NEXT YEAR.
[HELICOPTER WHIRRING FADES]
¶¶
Douglas:
THE GAME SHIFTED.
IT WOULD BE EASY IN THE CHAOS OF THIS LAST WEEK
TO LOSE SIGHT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE.
THE SHERPAS HAVE EFFECTIVELY CANCELED THE SEASON.
THEY HAD A CHOICE, AND IN THE END,
THEY'VE CHOSEN RESPECT FOR THEMSELVES AND THE MOUNTAIN
AHEAD OF MONEY.
CANCELING THE SEASON WILL BE A WELCOMED BREATHING SPACE.
SO MAYBE IT WILL BE CALMER.
IT WILL BE NICE FOR EVEREST TO BE CALM FOR A BIT
RATHER THAN THIS KIND OF MADNESS.
MY FATHER SAID THAT YOU DON'T CONQUER
THESE MOUNTAINS, YOU KNOW?
YOU JUST CRAWL UP,
AS A CHILD CRAWLING TO YOUR MOTHER'S LAP,
WHICH IS THE SAME APPROACH I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE.
THEN THERE'D BE LESS ACCIDENTS.
Norbu:
HE WAS THE FIRST ASIAN BECOME FAMOUS,
KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD,
AND HE BECAME A GREAT METAPHOR FOR YOUNG MEN
ALL ALIKE TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN,
HARD WORK IS WHAT IT TAKES.
AND SO HE BECAME A REAL SYMBOL OF HOPE
FOR MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

[PRAYER WHEELS CLANKING]
Douglas:
TENZING GAVE THE NAME SHERPA A CURRENCY
WHICH WILL NEVER BE EXHAUSTED.
SO IT MAY ONLY BE NOW
THAT THEY'RE REALLY BEGINNING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.
THEY'VE GOT CONTROL OF CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN,
AND IT'S COME FULL CIRCLE IN A WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
Jamling:
MY FATHER SAID HE CLIMBED
SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO.
HE WANTED TO GIVE US THE BEST EDUCATION
SO WE COULD CONTINUE OUR LIVES IN SOME OTHER CAREERS
RATHER THAN CLIMBING.

[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]
¶¶
¶¶
Douglas:
This is an astonishingly chance relationship.
Between western climbers and the sherpas.
When climbing began, the sherpas had no conception of what mountaineering might be, and yet, suddenly they were on this journey from being people who just genetically were really good at altitude to becoming, you know, international mountain guides 100 years later.
Man: 1953... coronation year.
The world was turned by the news that Everest had at last been conquered by a British expedition led by colonel John hunt.
Accompanied by the famous sherpa tenzing,
Edmund Hillary climbed the summit of the world's highest mountain.
Douglas:
When tenzing norgay reached the summit of Everest, that is such an amazing moment.
It's one of the most beautiful moments in climbing history.
That's the moment when the word "sherpa"
has the meaning of brand in the way that we understand it.
The world was captivated by tenzing.
And he fixed in our minds the popular image of a sherpa, as this smiling, friendly, almost heroic figure.
Jamling:
A lot of the western world.
Do not know what a sherpa is.
So, a sherpa, you know...
You climb mountains, you know?
And that's the first instinct, but they have no idea that we are actually an ethnic group of people.
We believe in reincarnation...
Life after death.
And you continue to be reborn and reborn and reborn until the day you reach nirvana.
So, your next life is determined by your deeds of this life.
We sherpa people have a great respect for the mountain.
Norgay:
Over here, we climb mountains, but it's a holy place.
There's a huge difference in, you know, the attitude, the feeling.
Western people approach it as a physical challenge...
Push your limit to see how close you can get to death.
But there's 1,000-year-old stories we have about the mountain's history, which these people have no idea about.
And I think some people adapt and learn and respect it.
Some people don't.
Douglas:
If phurba is one of the most successful climbing sherpas.
Of his generation, then his counterpart amongst expedition leaders is his boss, Russell Brice.
Brice:
I've been running commercial expeditions here.
Since 1994.
I think I'm the person that's been on more Everest expeditions than anyone else in the world.
- It's all oxygen.
- All oxygen.
And I brought those two broken ones in kathmandu.
How can I explain phurba tashi?
This year, he might climb Everest 22 times...
More than anyone else in the world...
And such a special person.
He's incredibly strong on the mountain.
Good idea.
Water here.
Hi, guys.
Lots of new faces.
Douglas:
The service-industry aspect.
Of climbing Everest has developed and developed.
So what mountaineers in 1975 maybe would have put up with, the people who are coming now want something a bit more.
You know, they want a very comfortable base camp.
Everything's good.
So much work for these guys to make all these platforms and put tents up.
The activity here has changed utterly.
It has become an industry, and that industry is people, largely, by sherpas.
And they may not still fully understand what it is that compels us to climb mountains, but they are fantastically good at delivering the experience.
Woodward:
So far, so good, actually.
Everybody's looking and sounding quite healthy.
A couple mild headaches, but that's to be expected.
Okay, folks.
Let's roll on out of town.
Steven:
In the old days, people did everything on the mountain together.
And today, the mountain has changed in that the operators take care of everything.
Brice:
In the old days, if you got one person on the summit, that was success.
Now, we need to get everyone on the summit.
So if you want to get everyone on the summit, you need much more creature comfort.
Certainly the type of person that comes on an expedition has changed considerably.
We bring people here to help them fulfill their dreams.
Hey!
Yeah!
Phurba, how's it going?
Good to see you.
You boys have done hard work.
Oh!
Hey, phurba.
Peter.
How are you?
It's been a goal as a climber.
I know to a lot of climbers, it might be trivial, but to me, being on top of Everest is just an achievement of a dream.
Johnson:
Part of the reason why you want to come and climb...
You want to experience those things, see if you can do it, see if you can physically do it.
It's a massive undertaking.
The training is phenomenal.
And, you know, it's not something you put together in a couple weeks.
It's months of planning and months of getting organized.
Everest has always been attractive for several reasons for me.
I love the Buddhist side to it.
I love the whole...
I love the nepalese people.
So, for me, it's been a more enjoyable mountain than most because I think that it's so cool, that you get to share it with these beautiful people.
Man:
Have you ever seen a man so particular?
Man #2:
Are you watching this right now?
Man #3:
It's like a caveman.
Douglas:
And so, for just eight hectic weeks each year,
Everest base camp becomes this thriving village.
And in recent years, overcrowding on Everest has been the source of a lot of controversy.
Williams:
It might just be the last place on earth.
You'd expect to find a traffic jam...
The top of the world...
Mount Everest.
Man #4:
These archive images show how lineups cause long and unnecessary delays.
Man #5:
More than 4,000 climbers have been to the top of Everest.
600 people do it in a good year.
It has become a very necessary part of the nepalese economy.
Man #6:
Expedition companies charge up to $100,000 to clients wanting to make the ascent.
Man #7:
Climbing Everest has become a bucket list ambition and a multi-million-dollar industry.
Douglas:
This is a, you know, big employer...
Lots and lots of people.
There are more sherpas working on the mountain now than there ever have been in history.
But they only get a small fraction of the pie.
Man #5:
The sherpa guides earn up to $5,000 for a two-month expedition, 10 times the average annual pay in their isolated homeland.
Douglas:
The whole Everest circus.
Just seems to get bigger and bigger, and this season is no exception.
Russell Brice's team is just one of 38 expeditions on the mountain this year.
All these people have to be looked after, and all their equipment has to be moved up the mountain.
You have Google maps photographing the route to the summit.
There's a Hollywood feature film.
There's even a guy in a wingsuit trying to jump off the top and fly all the way down.
Flisler:
So, we're here to put on one.
Of the most ambitious television projects in the history of the media world.
So he'll be flying down here, and we're gonna be broadcasting it all live.
There's a reason that superman movies or Batman movies and spider-man...
All these superheroes are so popular.
I can do what those guys can do.
Wardle:
It's kind of daft, but you know, in the world of adventure, people are always thinking of new crazy things to do.
Douglas:
It's part of the deal now...
Is that they're all kinds of strange notions of what can be done on Everest simply to attract attention.
One, two, three.
The way these commercial expeditions climb Everest is to establish a series of higher and higher camps, stocking them over a period of weeks with everything required to give the clients the best chance of reaching the summit.
The government doesn't permit equipment to be flown up the mountain, so everything that goes into building these camps has to be carried.
Douglas:
And it's the sherpas that do that work, including going through what is its most dangerous section.
If you want to climb Everest from the south, you have to go through the khumbu icefall.
It's the route up Everest most commercial operators prefer, partly because of political uncertainty on the northern side of the mountain in Tibet, which they'd rather avoid.
Mckinley:
The khumbu icefall is like a waterfall of ice.
Coming out of the western cwm.
There is nowhere else in the world that a mountaineer would go through an icefall like this.
But because it's the only access on the south side to Everest, then people do walk through this jumble of ice.
The problem with the icefall is that it's uncontrollable.
All the other aspects of the mountain that are dangerous have, you know, in terms of safety, have been improved over the years.
But the icefall remains, you know, perilous.
Douglas:
There are threats from every direction.
Not only that...
There are big blocks of ice falling down without warning from above.
You're asking men to go to work in a very dangerous environment.
And it's becoming more so as the seracs, these giant blocks of glacial ice, are affected by the forces of climate change.
They're dropping off more readily, and people are going to get caught more often.
Man #8:
Oh, shoot.
Douglas:
So you know that this is a perilous moment...
Going through the icefall.
Man #8:
Oh, my god.
Douglas:
And it's not just once or twice.
The sherpas have to go through it.
It's up to 30 trips per season, as compared to about two or three for most foreigners.
Brice:
I'm totally scared every time
I send the sherpas up in the mountain.
It's like sending them off to war.
I don't know who's gonna come home.
If there's an accident in the icefall, are we gonna lose one?
Are we gonna lose two?
Are we gonna lose six people?
Because the potential is there.
Douglas:
And the question is...
What is the moral justification for that?
You know, what reward is there for you to play what is essentially a game of Russian roulette?
In 2012, I determined the mountain to be dangerous.
Every night, I'd listen to the sherpas on the radio going through the icefall.
And all the time, they were running away from small avalanches and blocks of ice falling down and things like that.
So I made a decision to cancel my expedition.
That's an incredibly hard thing to do...
To cancel a commercial expedition.
Douglas:
There were people around who said,
"well, Russell's, you know, being a bit of a chump here"
because his clients will be pissed off because they went home
"and other people got to the top."
I think Russell Brice was really putting into perspective the risks that people were making the sherpas take.
Now Russell has four of those clients returning this year.
So that adds a lot of pressure for a successful expedition.
Douglas:
Tenzing norgay was a man.
Who was determined to change his stars.
And when he reached the summit of Everest, he did that.
The British couldn't have done it with someone like tenzing.
He'd been to the mountain seven times by that point, and they benefited from all those years of his experience, but he wasn't acknowledged.
He wasn't given due regard for what he had achieved.
Coming down from that, almost immediately, he finds himself in a political firestorm.
Reporter:
Who got to the top first?
Hunt:
To anybody who climbs mountains, to any mountaineer, and I feel to thousands of others.
The matter couldn't matter less.
Reporter #2:
When tenzing norgay was asked how he felt, his chilly answers had to be interpreted.
Hunt:
He's very happy.
Reporter #2:
All this and the George medal, too.
Douglas:
So John hunt became sir John hunt,
Hillary became sir ed Hillary, and tenzing got the George medal.
Now, there is a superior award to that... the George cross.
So it's kind of like a second-level award.
It was just not right.
So in the eyes of sherpas, in the eyes of people in India, in the eyes of most asians, they felt somewhat slighted that he would not get the same kind of recognition that his partners got.
Jamling:
My father said,
"i wish I had never climbed this mountain."
Douglas:
He was immensely proud of what he had achieved, but I think he felt thwarted in a way.
I think he felt that he hadn't realized himself in the way that he would have liked.
I think partly it's because, you know, he lacked a formal education.
Steven:
The 60-year-old reputation.
Of what it is to be a sherpa is changing.
Joshi:
Now, you go to base camp.
And more than 80% of sherpas finish their high school.
And if you go 20 years ago, none of them have been to high school.
Because of their education, they know a lot more than western clients think they do.
Steven:
Now with the Facebook generation, sherpas see how much credit westerners are getting for a climb on Everest, and they know that they've done most of the grunt work.
Without the sherpa, the westerner would never have gotten there.
And they are dissatisfied with that.
And they want equal credit for what they have done.
What we've seen in recent years is a...
A tendency of aggression from younger sherpas.
So, last year, there was fighting on Everest, and I think we were all disappointed, so sad about that.
Man #9:
Dozens of people risk their lives every year trying to climb mount Everest.
This morning, some of them say they nearly died in a brawl.
Woman:
Man versus the mountain to man versus man.
Man #11:
Three climbers say they faced a human foe.
Man #12:
Three top European climbers had to flee for their lives.
Man #13:
The highest-altitude scrap in history.
Man #14:
They just tried to kill us.
Man #15:
The sherpas tried to kill you?
Man #16:
This all unfolded near the summit, an altitude of roughly 22,000 feet.
Douglas:
You have a European calling a sherpa a...
Which is, in Nepal, particularly, culturally insensitive.
Man #17:
Yep.
I copy that.
I know what word you used.
I don't like that word, either.
Man #18:
Sherpas, who usually help westerners summit, turned against them.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for all what they said.
All the words that came out from my mouth was wrong.
I am sorry.
Yes.
Please.
Please, no violence.
- No.
- He came to apologize.
I'm sorry.
Yes, yes.
Please, no violence.
Listen.
He's very sorry.
No!
Inside, inside.
Hey!
Man #18:
It's not clear whether the fight was something personal or reflected a greater discontent.
Please, no violence.
Please!
It's about sherpas no longer feeling that they have to be subservient or deferent to western climbers and not playing out that role of the faithful servant anymore.
Not being the kind of nice, friendly, smiley person in the background.
Just saying, "actually, you know what?
We're as good as you."
Brice:
I'm a little afraid.
Where it's going to lead in the future.
It's too hard.
The tension is too hard.
The worry is too hard.
And I'm getting too old for that.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, mount Everest.
Hot towel.
Tea?
Ow.
Roughin' it on mount Everest.
Hot towels and tea in the morning.
Ah.
Can I have a tea with no sugar, please?
Douglas:
The reason Everest takes eight weeks to climb.
Is that the body needs to slowly acclimatize to the altitude.
Brice:
We do our acclimatization on lobuche peak.
To stay out of the icefall, to reduce the risk for our clients.
Douglas:
And so when, you know, Russell Brice.
Starts getting his clients to camp on top of, you know, a nearby peak rather than going through the icefall to acclimatize, you know, that makes sense.
The fewer trips anyone has to make through the icefall, the better.
Meanwhile, the sherpas are still stocking the camps on Everest, making dozens of trips up and down, carrying all the oxygen, the tents, the food, so on.
So that the mountain is ready to be climbed when the clients return.
Brice:
This year, my clients will go through the icefall twice, but I dare say most of the sherpas will go through maybe 20 to 30 times.
And I'm not sure the clients actually ever see that.
That was a nice day for a climb.
Brice:
I think a lot of people, even on our trips, don't really understand all this work is going on every night.
Loads of equipment going up to support them on the mountain.
But now we have to start the real job of why we're here, and that's going up through the mountain.
Safety is very, very important.
If you go through the icefall without crampons, if you go through the icefall without clipping on,
I'm gonna sack you.
You're gonna go home.
Douglas:
It must seem crazy going through the khumbu icefall.
In the dark, but it's actually much safer because it's more stable in the cold of night.
Once the sun hits, it becomes increasingly dangerous.
Brice:
You have to remember.
That you have a big responsibility not only for your own safety but for your family.
Even if it's a full moon, you must have your headlamp.
The transceivers must be turned on here, and you must use the transceiver every day that you go through the icefall.
We know if a serac falls on top of you you're not going to survive, but if you have a transceiver, it means to find you will take much less time.
And so that puts the people doing the rescue at much less risk.
Check, check.
Check, check.
There at least five out here that are out of the danger zone, and there's another four or five i can see that are still in the depths of the icefall.
Man #19:
Update from icefall...
13 or 14 missing.
Not sure what team they're from.
Phil, are all your boys okay?
Phil, I can't hear you, but are all your boys okay?
Just say yes or no.
Thumbs up.
Okay.
Thanks.
Man #21:
Get all the rescue rope you can find.
Russ, where's that...
Brice:
A.C. And a.A.I.
Dawa sherpa, a.C. Sherpa, and a.A.I. Sherpa.
No.
Mckinley:
I'm not aware of numbers, but it's significant amounts.
It's in the teens.
Keep that with you.
Okay.
Definitely bring the long line from kathmandu.
Cheers.
Bye.
Put these steel shovels, get them all together.
We want that sked.
Man #20:
If people are somewhat stable we're gonna want to be bringing them down from the scene if we can't fly them out.
For the beginning of the season.
- "A."
- Yeah.
How are you?
Namaste, Dave.
- That's it?
- Yeah.
Goes up, gets some oxygen, and you go second load.
One of my guys is very serious.
Mm-hmm.
So I think we're to bring him down fast, as soon as possible.
Because he's alive now.
Yeah, yeah.
We'll try.
My doctor here waiting.
- Yeah.
- It's okay.
But we need sked.
We need all that.
We need the oxygen up there first flight.
Yeah.
I think what we're trying to do is you and I in the first load.
Yeah.
I'll try and secure the helipad.
- Yep.
- Get it crackin'.
You do flight stuff, I'll just do medical stuff.
And you go down.
Exactly.
- Guys.
- Yes, yes.
If you're gonna make me in charge...
- Yeah, yeah.
- Please listen.
Okay.
I understand you're mountain guides.
I'm a mountain guide.
We've all got friends missing and dead.
We know that, okay?
We can't get everything up on the first load.
We want to send a doctor.
- Doctor.
One Nepali guide.
- They're requesting a doctor.
Doctor and one Nepali guide, okay?
Woman #2:
Who are these people?
Priority is being stabled and Melissa on it.
Mckinley:
Yeah, I think we've explained.
That Russell's in charge of the helipad down here, which means Melissa and I will be going first.
Man #21:
First victim is already packaged, ready to go.
Man #22:
Patient condition.
Man #21:
He's fully conscious, responsive.
Man #23:
But we are confused about how many casualties there are now.
We don't have a casualty count now.
We're working on live bodies at the moment.
Brice:
All sherpas not needed now leave and come to base camp.
It's starting to get hot.
Mckinley:
Jason's gonna go in, try and land in upper site, pull that sherpa off, bring him down to helipad.
Being switched to long line going to your location.
Woman #2:
Jason has landed at middle site.
Over.
Man #21:
There's a sherpa with a head injury and internal bleeding.
They're gonna keep him there, package him for a long line.
Yeah, Michael just requested as much rope as possible.
Mckinley:
There's a live patient with a query several fracture.
Pulse looks good call me from img, over.
Man #21:
Blood on the right...
Your right...
Arm bruising, upper left chest pain descending with Eric.
Brice:
I need to confirm...
Do we have anymore injured people to pick up or not?
Mckinley:
This is the last patient.
This is the last patient.
And then we can switch to non-traumatic body recovery flying down.
And we're gonna put an ecg on them to check for rhythm.
Over.
Woman #2:
A verify... we are absolutely in body recovery.
- Yes.
- Roger.
Mckinley:
Let's get this going.
This is by far the worst tragedy that's ever happened on Everest.
13 people have died this morning.
And there may be more still that we don't know about.
There hasn't been a year in history where 13 people have died on Everest, let alone in one day.
Man #24:
Break, break.
Michael has done an examination on all bodies.
No signs of life.
Brice:
I dare say...
This is the day that we just all dreaded.
Woman #3:
How are you feeling?
Shattered.
Every village will be affected.
A lot of our guys will have friends they know.
There's people from all over the khumbu who have been...
You know, young guys who, at least one of them i know just had a baby.
Just...
Man #25:
Now to the worst disaster ever seen on mount Everest.
Woman #4:
The avalanche hit at about 6:30 this morning local time at one of the busiest times of day on the mountain.
Man #25:
Greatest one-day toll recorded of the world's tallest mountain.
Woman #4:
A wall of snow crashed over the western shoulder.
Man #26:
The death toll's expected to rise to 16.
Man #27:
Questions are now being asked about the future of this year's climbing season and whether attempts will be made next month.
Man #28:
This tragedy adds to the death toll on Everest, which is already estimated at 250.
Man #29:
A four-day halt to climbing has been declared while the search for the missing sherpas goes on.
Douglas:
And you see the grief, and you know, that's going back decades.
You know, these grieving sherpa families...
This constant narrative of loss being expressed again.
Woman #5:
This morning, the search has been suspended for three other people who are still missing from mount Everest.
Crews did manage to recover a 13th body overnight.
Wardle:
Two days ago, 16 people died.
Including about half of our team.
This morning, I think the sherpas are taking matters into their own hands.
They're holding a big meeting at base camp.
We've just been told that the sherpas are quite angry and we should get bags ready just in case we have to make a swift exit.
We don't know if the sherpas are perhaps gonna target us as a focus for their anger...
Westerners coming here and causing such a kind of circus at times.
I don't know if there's any still-lingering tension from last year and the fights that broke out.
We're hoping the same thing doesn't happen again this year, but we're concerned about filming here right now.
16 people dying at the same time...
It's a huge, huge shock.
When it started to sink in, the anger got distinctly pointed at the government.
They feel that the government has always been benefiting off the labor of the sherpas, the lives of the sherpas, and never put anything back.
Douglas:
Nepal's tourism industry.
Is worth $360 million a year.
So when the government offers the families around $400, which isn't even enough to cover their funeral expenses, grief turns to anger very quickly.
The government...
You know, once it figured out that it could sell Everest as many times as it liked every year rather than once, it's basically just sat there, occasionally twiddled around the edges when there was some bad headlines,
but basically not really done anything since.
They've left it to western, you know, operators and just taken their cut every year, and it's a big cut.
It's like 1/3 of the money that stays in Nepal from this business goes to the government.
The sherpas...
They're still taking the risks.
You know, they've always taken the risks.
They're still taking the risks.
They, quite reasonably, think that's outrageous.
We worked really hard this morning to send a letter to the ministry asking for better conditions for these guys.
I would have thought that might preempt this type of meeting this afternoon.
Of course we're upset about people dying, but this is irrational, you know?
It's totally irrational.
I dare say they'd look at the arab summer and things like that and think that they can do the same sort of things.
It's hot-headed young guys who really don't have very much experience on this mountain in any case.
They're angry, yes.
They are.
Their grandparents and their fathers have worked hard in the himalayas.
All the hard work has been done by the sherpas, which is not fair.
It is not fair.
Man #30:
Every morning, we wake up and we realize that this is not a dream.
I'm sorry.
I don't really know what to say.
We had a... a day...
We've all been expecting an accident, and we had a very bad day.
The day that we never, ever wanted.
I am afraid every single day the boys go through the icefall.
I fear every day, but, guys, we also have to progress.
We have to progress for the future.
Otherwise, you have no income for your families.
Douglas:
This is unprecedented that the sherpas.
Could contemplate giving up a season's earning in order to make their point.
One of the biggest requests from the workers in this base camp is to not continue climbing this year.
We know that's a great big ask, but it's somewhat small compared to the 16 lives we've lost in this mountain.
This is not workable for us.
We've still got our sherpas to come to talk to, to see if we want to carry on climbing or not.
We can't have this happening every time there's an accident every season.
It's getting out of control.
We're being forced off this mountain by renegade sherpas.
Joshi:
We only became a Democratic country in the '90s, so people feel like they have more freedom of speech.
So whenever they speak something that is a bit more bold, it obviously takes the western people who are the base camp by surprise.
They're saying what they think.
They're not rebels.
They're just mountain guides.
Brice:
I'm asking for a helicopter.
To go to the ministry.
The government has not taken much notice in the past, so I think now's the time.
I think we're confident that we're gonna recover the situation, but only if we act right now.
Man #31:
Good morning.
Well, it began as a tragedy and has now turned into an avalanche of resentment that threatens the entire Everest industry.
Woman #6:
Sherpa guides on mount Everest are staging a boycott that threatens to shut down next month's climbing season.
Man #31:
The issue is why the sherpa climbing guides, who assume a disproportionately large part of the risk get a disproportionately small part of the take.
I'd like to know a little bit about what's going on, you know?
We hear from, you know...
Simon hears from the European papers that the season's over.
I hear from American media that there's a potential strike and there's still negotiating going on, but...
- We don't know anything, huh?
- Nothing.
We can sit it, and yet we don't know a thing.
He's paid for a helicopter to come and take him so we can go talk to the people that can make decisions.
He's working on it, and until those discussions are over, there's nothing but speculation, which is exactly what we're doing.
Sorry, guys.
I mean, if I had more information,
I would give it to you.
I'm going.
There's an inherent risk in mountaineering.
There's an inherent risk in Everest.
There's an inherent risk in the khumbu.
I know that.
I'm willing to assume that risk.
Mckinley:
I think some of the clients.
Are getting a little restless, but I think we're in the right place at the right time, and we're still going forward on our plan.
So if the word is "yes, your crew will go with you,"
we're still going forward.
Man #32:
The future of the Everest climbing season is hanging in the balance this morning.
Woman #7:
Nepalese government officials are flying into try and ease tensions at base camp.
Douglas:
There was a lot of expectation.
Surrounding the ministerial visit.
The sherpas hoped they would show some leadership and cancel the season.
The clients hoped the government would agree to the sherpa demands so the season could continue.
Man #33:
Sit down, please!
Douglas:
So in failing to act decisively.
Or take any kind of official position, the government have really left the sherpas between a rock and a hard place.
But just coming to base camp, they don't make money.
They make money on the mountain, carrying loads up there.
The higher they go, the more they carry, the more they're paid.
Just coming to base camp, they make nothing.
But for the last 61 years, we've waited.
Something had to happen and then we had to raise our voice and to such a huge loss.
They're ready to face the consequences.
They'd rather leave than die.
Douglas:
I think many expedition leaders found themselves.
In an incredibly difficult position.
Balancing the interests of clients and the sherpas in a situation like this was never going to be easy.
Linville:
What happened was really a tragic day, a black day.
I feel still positive if we're gonna be allowed to go up the mountain, you know, and continue the journey and hopefully it's successful and you know, life goes on, and just try to remember the guys for what they were
and carry a positive message.
I knew the risks.
From a personal point of view, i was prepared to take that, but to ask the sherpa boys to go through it time and time again, it's a difficult one.
It's hard just to...
Not to think about what happened to all those families, those boys.
They're doing it for us.
But I put so much work into this and effort.
Then you start to justify it.
Doyle:
For us, it's déjà vu, isn't it, Jeff?
Yeah.
We've been through this, you know?
This was 2012.
Actually, what Russell feared would happen in 2012 is exactly what happened.
To have to come back here a second time only to get canceled again and never given the shot is...
Yeah, that'll be... that'll be devastating to me, I think.
Yeah.
Woman #5:
As we reported earlier this week, sherpas are leading a boycott after that deadly avalanche.
Man #34:
Starting to make climbing for those who might want to continue very, very challenging.
Woman #5:
Most of the climbers will forfeit the money they paid for the journey.
That can top $75,000.
I flew back again here this morning to find that I'm probably the last team to decide whether we're going to be continuing on the mountain or not.
Yes, we had one avalanche.
Unfortunately, it killed a lot of people.
But that's no reason to stop the expedition.
Today, a delegation...
They came to the base camp to try and calm things down.
But I'm afraid it just escalated things.
It didn't help.
We know that there's only a group of four or five guys that are causing this problem, but then they excite 300-odd guys, and when you have mob rule, what can we do?
Effectively, what these militant sherpas are saying is...
If our sherpas go through the icefall, they'll beat them up.
Then we all know about the fighting on Everest last year.
We would hope that there will be some form of punishment to these guys.
Or we need to get rid of them, out of this system so it doesn't happen again.
You know who employs them, Russ?
These four or five?
I know who employs some of them, yeah.
And there's no way you can talk to their owners and...
I mean, if this was one of your sherpas, you could have them removed from the mountain.
Well, I would.
Yes.
So...
But, yes.
But I don't know how to do that.
These people are totally irrational.
They don't care.
Next week or next month, they'll be at home with nothing to eat.
We have one last chance as our sherpas are still prepared to go up the mountain.
As far as I know, our sherpas want to climb.
But they fear for their life.
Phurba will be here early tomorrow.
We have to discuss everything with him.
So, sorry, guys.
That's it.
- Oh, namaste.
- Namaste.
How's it going?
Okay.
How you doing?
Douglas:
Sherpas are not people who express their emotions.
Very willingly.
So it's sometimes hard to read them.
Brice:
Lots of attention on you now.
It's okay.
Just relax.
Let's have a cup of tea first, huh?
Namaste.
So, how's everyone at home?
Upset?
- A bit upset.
- Yeah.
I know.
Just...
Understandably, you know.
Mm-hmm.
And wives.
How do wives feel?
Don't want you coming or...
How they want... how they say?
They are happy that we're back, but they're still afraid...
Afraid.
Afraid, too, that we're going back again.
Yeah.
I'm sure.
We're all afraid.
Yeah.
We're all afraid, phurba.
So.
What to do.
Want to go north side?
- Still very risky.
- Huh?
There's risk every time.
Doesn't matter where we go.
Mm-hmm.
So, um...
I understand how you feel.
You want to climb, but you also have respect for the people and everything.
Yeah.
Although, I checked with all the Buddhists and hindu.
You know, if we respect, then we can carry on doing our work, but what we feel here is danger for you from other sherpa.
Did you hear anything about that?
- No, I didn't.
- Didn't hear that?
So, for me, i feel afraid for you.
We feel danger for you guys if you carry on climbing, but maybe later, some violence to you...
How you feel about that.
'Cause this is not normal sherpa.
How do you guys feel?
Maybe you're angry with me.
And if you're angry, then you have to tell me, but, you know,
I think pressure coming from outside...
And I'm afraid for you.
So, I think we have to stop expedition.
- You agree?
- Mm-hmm.
You agree to stop expedition?
- Yeah.
- Everyone?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
So I have to tell the members like that?
Mm-hmm.
I don't want, but also, if just us, how can I afford all the rope?
Because I have to buy from expedition operators.
So, for me, i can't afford just us.
You know, before it was always friendly, smiling sherpa, always helping.
These guys have spoiled your reputation.
Okay.
What to do now.
I have to go and tell members we're finished.
Mm-hmm.
You know, my prayers are with you.
Sad.
Glad you're okay.
So glad to see you here.
So, as I told you last night, it's unlikely that we would continue and the sherpas feel under too much threat.
They've already been told if they go through icefall, they'll break their legs.
So...
This is the word that comes to them that these other guys up here will break their legs if they go through the icefall.
Yes, they want to climb.
Out of respect, they don't want to climb, and out of fear, they don't want to climb.
Not fear of the mountain.
Fear of the people.
So there you go, guys.
What can I say?
And I don't know what to do.
And phurba doesn't know what to do.
And we're pissed off.
We're angry that these people are ruining our business, you know?
Their business.
What can we do?
I don't know how to apologize to you.
I... don't know how to do that.
Especially the people that have come twice.
Okay.
So, now how to get out of here.
Essentially, we were just given the news that the sherpas' legs would be broken if they were to help us get up this mountain.
How can you possibly argue with that one?
Being held captive by terrorists, is how I look at it.
I mean, when people demand change and threaten it by violence, that's a terrorist, you know.
And we in the states, we know what that is...
After 9/11.
We've got a group here that's terrorizing base camp.
How do you anticipate that, you know?
How do you...
How do you mentally prepare yourself to get up here and then be turned away because a group of terrorists are demanding that westerners leave base camp?
You know, it's... it's hard.
Do I have it in me for a third time to try to come back and do Everest?
I've got to go talk with my family, I think, before I make any final decisions.
But I certainly would like to get to the top of the highest mountain in the world and be able to provide that legacy to my family as something they...
Now you got me.
Man #34:
Oh, we'll be back.
We'll be back hopefully next year.
One way or another,
I'll tack the top of that mountain at some point, so... just a slight setback.
I'm gonna feel better when I go home knowing that we didn't climb up that mountain after the big tragedy.
It's just better to show my respect for the sherpa community by leaving.
Joshi:
I think the expedition organizers...
They knew in their heart what their sherpa wants, but they couldn't tell that clearly to their clients.
It's just the excuses they are using to throw the blame on somebody else, yeah.
If this didn't change anything, then nothing ever will.
Then Nepal will just be like the wild, wild west for the western operators to do whatever they want.
This thing has happened, which is a sad thing, but hopefully, this will bring something positive into the mountain.
Brice:
It must have some effect of the Everest industry...
The accident this year.
I think this made me more determined to try and change the rules so we can continue with Everest as usual but in a safer way.
I've been a mountain guide all my life.
We have to deal with death a lot, and then try and move on.
Hopefully, we will have a team to go to climb mount Everest again next year.
Douglas:
The game shifted.
It would be easy in the chaos of this last week to lose sight of what has happened here.
The sherpas have effectively canceled the season.
They had a choice, and in the end, they've chosen respect for themselves and the mountain ahead of money.
Canceling the season will be a welcomed breathing space.
So maybe it will be calmer.
It will be nice for Everest to be calm for a bit rather than this kind of madness.
My father said that you don't conquer these mountains, you know?
You just crawl up, as a child crawling to your mother's lap, which is the same approach i think people should take.
Then there'd be less accidents.
Norbu:
He was the first Asian to become famous, known around the world, and he became a great metaphor for young men all alike to show that you can make it on your own, hard work is what it takes.
And so he became a real symbol of hope for millions around the world.
Douglas:
Tenzing gave the name sherpa a currency.
Which will never be exhausted.
So it may only be now that they're really beginning to take advantage of it.
They've got control of climbing the mountain, and it's come full circle in a way.
Jamling:
My father said he climbed.
So that we wouldn't have to.
He wanted to give us the best education so we could continue our lives in some other careers rather than climbing.
Because climbing was dangerous.

THIS IS AN ASTONISHINGLY CHANCE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN WESTERN CLIMBERS AND THE SHERPAS.
WHEN CLIMBING BEGAN, THE SHERPAS HAD NO CONCEPTION
OF WHAT MOUNTAINEERING MIGHT BE,
AND YET, SUDDENLY THEY WERE ON THIS JOURNEY
FROM BEING PEOPLE WHO JUST GENETICALLY WERE REALLY GOOD
AT ALTITUDE TO BECOMING,
YOU KNOW, INTERNATIONAL MOUNTAIN GUIDES 100 YEARS LATER.
1953 -
- CORONATION YEAR.
THE WORLD WAS TURNED BY THE NEWS
THAT EVEREST HAD AT LAST BEEN CONQUERED
BY A BRITISH EXPEDITION LED BY COLONEL JOHN HUNT.
ACCOMPANIED BY THE FAMOUS SHERPA TENZING,
EDMUND HILLARY CLIMBED THE SUMMIT
OF THE WORLD'S HIGHEST MOUNTAIN.
WHEN TENZING NORGAY REACHED THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST,
THAT IS SUCH AN AMAZING MOMENT.
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS
IN CLIMBING HISTORY.
THAT'S THE MOMENT WHEN THE WORD "SHERPA"
HAS THE MEANING OF BRAND IN THE WAY THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT.
THE WORLD WAS CAPTIVATED BY TENZING.
AND HE FIXED IN OUR MINDS THE POPULAR IMAGE OF A SHERPA,
AS THIS SMILING, FRIENDLY, ALMOST HEROIC FIGURE.
A LOT OF THE WESTERN WORLD
DO NOT KNOW WHAT A SHERPA IS.
SO, A SHERPA, YOU KNOW -- YOU CLIMB MOUNTAINS, YOU KNOW?
AND THAT'S THE FIRST INSTINCT,
BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT WE ARE
ACTUALLY AN ETHNIC GROUP OF PEOPLE.
WE BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION -- LIFE AFTER DEATH.
AND YOU CONTINUE TO BE REBORN AND REBORN AND REBORN
UNTIL THE DAY YOU REACH NIRVANA.
SO, YOUR NEXT LIFE IS DETERMINED BY YOUR DEEDS OF THIS LIFE.
WE SHERPA PEOPLE HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MOUNTAIN.
OVER HERE, WE CLIMB MOUNTAINS,
BUT IT'S A HOLY PLACE.
THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN, YOU KNOW,
THE ATTITUDE, THE FEELING.
WESTERN PEOPLE APPROACH IT AS A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE --
PUSH YOUR LIMIT TO SEE HOW CLOSE YOU CAN GET TO DEATH.
BUT THERE'S 1,000-YEAR-OLD STORIES
WE HAVE ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN'S HISTORY,
WHICH THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT.
AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE ADAPT AND LEARN AND RESPECT IT.
SOME PEOPLE DON'T.
IF PHURBA IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CLIMBING SHERPAS
OF HIS GENERATION,
THEN HIS COUNTERPART AMONGST EXPEDITION LEADERS
IS HIS BOSS, RUSSELL BRICE.
I'VE BEEN RUNNING COMMERCIAL EXPEDITIONS HERE
SINCE 1994.
I THINK I'M THE PERSON THAT'S BEEN
ON MORE EVEREST EXPEDITIONS THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD.
IT'S ALL OXYGEN.
- ALL OXYGEN.
AND I BROUGHT THOSE TWO BROKEN ONES IN KATHMANDU.
HOW CAN I EXPLAIN PHURBA TASHI?
THIS YEAR, HE MIGHT CLIMB EVEREST 22 TIMES --
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD --
AND SUCH A SPECIAL PERSON.
HE'S INCREDIBLY STRONG ON THE MOUNTAIN.
GOOD IDEA.
WATER HERE.
HI, GUYS.
LOTS OF NEW FACES.
¶¶
THE SERVICE-INDUSTRY ASPECT
OF CLIMBING EVEREST HAS DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPED.
SO WHAT MOUNTAINEERS IN 1975 MAYBE WOULD HAVE PUT UP WITH,
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING NOW WANT SOMETHING A BIT MORE.
YOU KNOW, THEY WANT A VERY COMFORTABLE BASE CAMP.
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.
SO MUCH WORK FOR THESE GUYS
TO MAKE ALL THESE PLATFORMS AND PUT TENTS UP.
THE ACTIVITY HERE HAS CHANGED UTTERLY.
IT HAS BECOME AN INDUSTRY,
AND THAT INDUSTRY IS PEOPLE, LARGELY, BY SHERPAS.
AND THEY MAY NOT STILL FULLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT IS THAT COMPELS US TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS,
BUT THEY ARE FANTASTICALLY GOOD AT DELIVERING THE EXPERIENCE.
¶¶
SO FAR, SO GOOD, ACTUALLY.
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING AND SOUNDING QUITE HEALTHY.
A COUPLE MILD HEADACHES, BUT THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.
OKAY, FOLKS.
LET'S ROLL ON OUT OF TOWN.
¶¶
IN THE OLD DAYS,
PEOPLE DID EVERYTHING ON THE MOUNTAIN TOGETHER.
AND TODAY, THE MOUNTAIN HAS CHANGED IN THAT
THE OPERATORS TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.
IN THE OLD DAYS,
IF YOU GOT ONE PERSON ON THE SUMMIT,
THAT WAS SUCCESS.
NOW, WE NEED TO GET EVERYONE ON THE SUMMIT.
SO IF YOU WANT TO GET EVERYONE ON THE SUMMIT,
YOU NEED MUCH MORE CREATURE COMFORT.
CERTAINLY THE TYPE OF PERSON
THAT COMES ON AN EXPEDITION HAS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY.
WE BRING PEOPLE HERE TO HELP THEM FULFILL THEIR DREAMS.
HEY!
YEAH!
PHURBA, HOW'S IT GOING?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOU BOYS HAVE DONE HARD WORK.
OH!
HEY, PHURBA.
PETER.
HOW ARE YOU?
IT'S BEEN A GOAL AS A CLIMBER.
I KNOW TO A LOT OF CLIMBERS, IT MIGHT BE TRIVIAL,
BUT TO ME, BEING ON TOP OF EVEREST
IS JUST AN ACHIEVEMENT OF A DREAM.
PART OF THE REASON WHY YOU WANT TO COME AND CLIMB --
YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE THOSE THINGS,
SEE IF YOU CAN DO IT, SEE IF YOU CAN PHYSICALLY DO IT.
IT'S A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING.
THE TRAINING IS PHENOMENAL.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU PUT TOGETHER IN A COUPLE WEEKS.
IT'S MONTHS OF PLANNING AND MONTHS OF GETTING ORGANIZED.
EVEREST HAS ALWAYS BEEN ATTRACTIVE
FOR SEVERAL REASONS FOR ME.
I LOVE THE BUDDHIST SIDE TO IT.
I LOVE THE WHOLE -- I LOVE THE NEPALESE PEOPLE.
SO, FOR ME, IT'S BEEN A MORE ENJOYABLE MOUNTAIN THAN MOST
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S SO COOL,
THAT YOU GET TO SHARE IT WITH THESE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A MAN SO PARTICULAR?
Man
Man
AND SO, FOR JUST EIGHT HECTIC WEEKS EACH YEAR,
EVEREST BASE CAMP BECOMES THIS THRIVING VILLAGE.
AND IN RECENT YEARS, OVERCROWDING ON EVEREST
HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF A LOT OF CONTROVERSY.
IT MIGHT JUST BE THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH
YOU'D EXPECT TO FIND A TRAFFIC JAM --
THE TOP OF THE WORLD -- MOUNT EVEREST.
Man
CAUSE LONG AND UNNECESSARY DELAYS.
Man 600 PEOPLE DO IT IN A GOOD YEAR.
IT HAS BECOME A VERY NECESSARY PART OF THE NEPALESE ECONOMY.
Man
TO CLIENTS WANTING TO MAKE THE ASCENT.
Man
AND A MULTI-MILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY.
THIS IS A, YOU KNOW, BIG EMPLOYER --
LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE.
THERE ARE MORE SHERPAS WORKING ON THE MOUNTAIN NOW
THAN THERE EVER HAVE BEEN IN HISTORY.
BUT THEY ONLY GET A SMALL FRACTION OF THE PIE.
Man
FOR A TWO-MONTH EXPEDITION, 10 TIMES THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PAY
IN THEIR ISOLATED HOMELAND.
THE WHOLE EVEREST CIRCUS
JUST SEEMS TO GET BIGGER AND BIGGER,
AND THIS SEASON IS NO EXCEPTION.
RUSSELL BRICE'S TEAM IS JUST ONE OF 38 EXPEDITIONS
ON THE MOUNTAIN THIS YEAR.
ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE LOOKED AFTER,
AND ALL THEIR EQUIPMENT HAS TO BE MOVED UP THE MOUNTAIN.
YOU HAVE GOOGLE MAPS
PHOTOGRAPHING THE ROUTE TO THE SUMMIT.
THERE'S A HOLLYWOOD FEATURE FILM.
THERE'S EVEN A GUY IN A WINGSUIT
TRYING TO JUMP OFF THE TOP AND FLY ALL THE WAY DOWN.
SO, WE'RE HERE TO PUT ON ONE
OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS TELEVISION PROJECTS
IN THE HISTORY OF THE MEDIA WORLD.
SO HE'LL BE FLYING DOWN HERE,
AND WE'RE GONNA BE BROADCASTING IT ALL LIVE.
THERE'S A REASON THAT SUPERMAN MOVIES
OR BATMAN MOVIES AND SPIDER-MAN --
ALL THESE SUPERHEROES ARE SO POPULAR.
I CAN DO WHAT THOSE GUYS CAN DO.
IT'S KIND OF DAFT,
BUT YOU KNOW, IN THE WORLD OF ADVENTURE,
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS THINKING OF NEW CRAZY THINGS TO DO.
IT'S PART OF THE DEAL NOW --
IS THAT THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF STRANGE NOTIONS
OF WHAT CAN BE DONE ON EVEREST SIMPLY TO ATTRACT ATTENTION.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
THE WAY THESE COMMERCIAL EXPEDITIONS CLIMB EVEREST
IS TO ESTABLISH A SERIES OF HIGHER AND HIGHER CAMPS,
STOCKING THEM OVER A PERIOD OF WEEKS
WITH EVERYTHING REQUIRED TO GIVE THE CLIENTS
THE BEST CHANCE OF REACHING THE SUMMIT.
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T PERMIT EQUIPMENT
TO BE FLOWN UP THE MOUNTAIN,
SO EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO BUILDING THESE CAMPS
HAS TO BE CARRIED.
AND IT'S THE SHERPAS THAT DO THAT WORK,
INCLUDING GOING THROUGH WHAT IS ITS MOST DANGEROUS SECTION.
¶¶
IF YOU WANT TO CLIMB EVEREST FROM THE SOUTH,
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE KHUMBU ICEFALL.
IT'S THE ROUTE UP EVEREST MOST COMMERCIAL OPERATORS PREFER,
PARTLY BECAUSE OF POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY
ON THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN IN TIBET,
WHICH THEY'D RATHER AVOID.
THE KHUMBU ICEFALL IS LIKE A WATERFALL OF ICE
COMING OUT OF THE WESTERN CWM.
THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
THAT A MOUNTAINEER WOULD GO THROUGH AN ICEFALL LIKE THIS.
BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY ACCESS ON THE SOUTH SIDE TO EVEREST,
THEN PEOPLE DO WALK THROUGH THIS JUMBLE OF ICE.
THE PROBLEM WITH THE ICEFALL IS THAT IT'S UNCONTROLLABLE.
ALL THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT ARE DANGEROUS
HAVE, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF SAFETY,
HAVE BEEN IMPROVED OVER THE YEARS.
BUT THE ICEFALL REMAINS, YOU KNOW, PERILOUS.
¶¶
THERE ARE THREATS FROM EVERY DIRECTION.
NOT ONLY THAT -- THERE ARE BIG BLOCKS OF ICE
FALLING DOWN WITHOUT WARNING FROM ABOVE.
YOU'RE ASKING MEN TO GO TO WORK IN A VERY DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT.
AND IT'S BECOMING MORE SO AS THE SERACS,
THESE GIANT BLOCKS OF GLACIAL ICE,
ARE AFFECTED BY THE FORCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
THEY'RE DROPPING OFF MORE READILY,
AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET CAUGHT MORE OFTEN.
Man
SO YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS A PERILOUS MOMENT --
GOING THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
Man
AND IT'S NOT JUST ONCE OR TWICE
THE SHERPAS HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT.
IT'S UP TO 30 TRIPS PER SEASON,
AS COMPARED TO ABOUT TWO OR THREE FOR MOST FOREIGNERS.
I'M TOTALLY SCARED EVERY TIME
I SEND THE SHERPAS UP IN THE MOUNTAIN.
IT'S LIKE SENDING THEM OFF TO WAR.
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GONNA COME HOME.
IF THERE'S AN ACCIDENT IN THE ICEFALL,
ARE WE GONNA LOSE ONE?
ARE WE GONNA LOSE TWO?
ARE WE GONNA LOSE SIX PEOPLE?
BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL IS THERE.
AND THE QUESTION IS --
WHAT IS THE MORAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT?
YOU KNOW, WHAT REWARD IS THERE FOR YOU TO PLAY
WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A GAME OF RUSSIAN ROULETTE?
IN 2012, I DETERMINED THE MOUNTAIN TO BE DANGEROUS.
EVERY NIGHT, I'D LISTEN TO THE SHERPAS
ON THE RADIO GOING THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
AND ALL THE TIME, THEY WERE RUNNING AWAY
FROM SMALL AVALANCHES AND BLOCKS OF ICE
FALLING DOWN AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
SO I MADE A DECISION TO CANCEL MY EXPEDITION.
THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY HARD THING TO DO --
TO CANCEL A COMMERCIAL EXPEDITION.
THERE WERE PEOPLE AROUND WHO SAID,
"WELL, RUSSELL'S, YOU KNOW, BEING A BIT OF A CHUMP HERE
BECAUSE HIS CLIENTS WILL BE PISSED OFF
BECAUSE THEY WENT HOME
AND OTHER PEOPLE GOT TO THE TOP."
I THINK RUSSELL BRICE
WAS REALLY PUTTING INTO PERSPECTIVE THE RISKS
THAT PEOPLE WERE MAKING THE SHERPAS TAKE.
NOW RUSSELL HAS FOUR OF THOSE CLIENTS
RETURNING THIS YEAR.
SO THAT ADDS A LOT OF PRESSURE FOR A SUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION.
TENZING NORGAY WAS A MAN
WHO WAS DETERMINED TO CHANGE HIS STARS.
AND WHEN HE REACHED THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST, HE DID THAT.
THE BRITISH COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITH SOMEONE LIKE TENZING.
HE'D BEEN TO THE MOUNTAIN SEVEN TIMES BY THAT POINT,
AND THEY BENEFITED FROM ALL THOSE YEARS
OF HIS EXPERIENCE, BUT HE WASN'T ACKNOWLEDGED.
HE WASN'T GIVEN DUE REGARD FOR WHAT HE HAD ACHIEVED.
COMING DOWN FROM THAT, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,
HE FINDS HIMSELF IN A POLITICAL FIRESTORM.
WHO GOT TO THE TOP FIRST?
TO ANYBODY WHO CLIMBS MOUNTAINS, TO ANY MOUNTAINEER,
AND I FEEL TO THOUSANDS OF OTHERS.
THE MATTER COULDN'T MATTER LESS.
Reporter
HIS CHILLY ANSWERS HAD TO BE INTERPRETED.
HE'S VERY HAPPY.
Reporter
SO JOHN HUNT BECAME SIR JOHN HUNT,
HILLARY BECAME SIR ED HILLARY,
AND TENZING GOT THE GEORGE MEDAL.
NOW, THERE IS A SUPERIOR AWARD TO THAT -
- THE GEORGE CROSS.
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SECOND-LEVEL AWARD.
IT WAS JUST NOT RIGHT.
SO IN THE EYES OF SHERPAS,
IN THE EYES OF PEOPLE IN INDIA,
IN THE EYES OF MOST ASIANS, THEY FELT SOMEWHAT SLIGHTED
THAT HE WOULD NOT GET THE SAME KIND OF RECOGNITION
THAT HIS PARTNERS GOT.
MY FATHER SAID,
"I WISH I HAD NEVER CLIMBED THIS MOUNTAIN."
HE WAS IMMENSELY PROUD OF WHAT HE HAD ACHIEVED,
BUT I THINK HE FELT THWARTED IN A WAY.
I THINK HE FELT THAT HE HADN'T REALIZED HIMSELF
IN THE WAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE LIKED.
I THINK PARTLY IT'S BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
HE LACKED A FORMAL EDUCATION.
THE 60-YEAR-OLD REPUTATION
OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A SHERPA IS CHANGING.
NOW, YOU GO TO BASE CAMP
AND MORE THAN 80 % OF SHERPAS FINISH THEIR HIGH SCHOOL.
AND IF YOU GO 20 YEARS AGO,
NONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN TO HIGH SCHOOL.
BECAUSE OF THEIR EDUCATION, THEY KNOW A LOT MORE
THAN WESTERN CLIENTS THINK THEY DO.
NOW WITH THE FACEBOOK GENERATION,
SHERPAS SEE HOW MUCH CREDIT WESTERNERS
ARE GETTING FOR A CLIMB ON EVEREST,
AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY'VE DONE MOST OF THE GRUNT WORK.
WITHOUT THE SHERPA,
THE WESTERNER WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN THERE.
AND THEY ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THAT.
AND THEY WANT EQUAL CREDIT FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS IS A...
A TENDENCY OF AGGRESSION
FROM YOUNGER SHERPAS.
SO, LAST YEAR, THERE WAS FIGHTING ON EVEREST,
AND I THINK WE WERE ALL DISAPPOINTED,
SO SAD ABOUT THAT.
Man
TRYING TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST.
THIS MORNING, SOME OF THEM SAY THEY NEARLY DIED IN A BRAWL.
MAN VERSUS THE MOUNTAIN TO MAN VERSUS MAN.
Man
Man
HAD TO FLEE FOR THEIR LIVES.
Man
Man
Man
Man
AN ALTITUDE OF ROUGHLY 22,000 FEET.
YOU HAVE A EUROPEAN CALLING A SHERPA A...
WHICH IS, IN NEPAL, PARTICULARLY,
CULTURALLY INSENSITIVE.
Man
I DON'T LIKE THAT WORD, EITHER.
Man
TURNED AGAINST THEM.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY FOR ALL WHAT THEY SAID.
ALL THE WORDS THAT CAME OUT FROM MY MOUTH WAS WRONG.
I AM SORRY.
YES.
PLEASE.
PLEASE, NO VIOLENCE.
NO.
- HE CAME TO APOLOGIZE.
I'M SORRY.
YES, YES.
PLEASE, NO VIOLENCE.
LISTEN.
HE'S VERY SORRY.
NO!
INSIDE, INSIDE.
HEY!
Man
OR REFLECTED A GREATER DISCONTENT.
PLEASE, NO VIOLENCE.
PLEASE!
¶¶
IT'S ABOUT SHERPAS NO LONGER FEELING
THAT THEY HAVE TO BE SUBSERVIENT OR DEFERENT TO WESTERN CLIMBERS
AND NOT PLAYING OUT THAT ROLE OF THE FAITHFUL SERVANT ANYMORE.
NOT BEING THE KIND OF NICE, FRIENDLY, SMILEY PERSON
IN THE BACKGROUND.
JUST SAYING, "ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE AS GOOD AS YOU."
I'M A LITTLE AFRAID
WHERE IT'S GOING TO LEAD IN THE FUTURE.
IT'S TOO HARD.
THE TENSION IS TOO HARD.
THE WORRY IS TOO HARD.
AND I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR THAT.
¶¶
- GOOD MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING, MOUNT EVEREST.
HOT TOWEL.
TEA?
OW.
ROUGHIN' IT ON MOUNT EVEREST.
HOT TOWELS AND TEA IN THE MORNING.
AH.
¶¶
CAN I HAVE A TEA WITH NO SUGAR, PLEASE?
¶¶
THE REASON EVEREST TAKES EIGHT WEEKS TO CLIMB
IS THAT THE BODY NEEDS TO SLOWLY ACCLIMATIZE TO THE ALTITUDE.
WE DO OUR ACCLIMATIZATION ON LOBUCHE PEAK
TO STAY OUT OF THE ICEFALL,
TO REDUCE THE RISK FOR OUR CLIENTS.
AND SO WHEN, YOU KNOW, RUSSELL BRICE
STARTS GETTING HIS CLIENTS TO CAMP ON TOP OF, YOU KNOW,
A NEARBY PEAK RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THE ICEFALL
TO ACCLIMATIZE, YOU KNOW, THAT MAKES SENSE.
THE FEWER TRIPS ANYONE HAS TO MAKE THROUGH THE ICEFALL,
THE BETTER.
MEANWHILE, THE SHERPAS ARE STILL STOCKING THE CAMPS
ON EVEREST, MAKING DOZENS OF TRIPS UP AND DOWN,
CARRYING ALL THE OXYGEN, THE TENTS, THE FOOD, SO ON.
SO THAT THE MOUNTAIN IS READY TO BE CLIMBED
WHEN THE CLIENTS RETURN.
THIS YEAR, MY CLIENTS WILL GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL TWICE,
BUT I DARE SAY MOST OF THE SHERPAS
WILL GO THROUGH MAYBE 20 TO 30 TIMES.
AND I'M NOT SURE THE CLIENTS ACTUALLY EVER SEE THAT.
THAT WAS A NICE DAY FOR A CLIMB.
¶¶
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE, EVEN ON OUR TRIPS,
DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
ALL THIS WORK IS GOING ON EVERY NIGHT.
LOADS OF EQUIPMENT GOING UP TO SUPPORT THEM ON THE MOUNTAIN.
BUT NOW WE HAVE TO START THE REAL JOB OF WHY WE'RE HERE,
AND THAT'S GOING UP THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN.
SAFETY IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.
IF YOU GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL WITHOUT CRAMPONS,
IF YOU GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL WITHOUT CLIPPING ON,
I'M GONNA SACK YOU.
YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME.
IT MUST SEEM CRAZY GOING THROUGH THE KHUMBU ICEFALL
IN THE DARK, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH SAFER
BECAUSE IT'S MORE STABLE IN THE COLD OF NIGHT.
ONCE THE SUN HITS,
IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THAT YOU HAVE A BIG RESPONSIBILITY
NOT ONLY FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY BUT FOR YOUR FAMILY.
EVEN IF IT'S A FULL MOON, YOU MUST HAVE YOUR HEADLAMP.
THE TRANSCEIVERS MUST BE TURNED ON HERE,
AND YOU MUST USE THE TRANSCEIVER EVERY DAY
THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
WE KNOW IF A SERAC FALLS ON TOP OF YOU
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SURVIVE, BUT IF YOU HAVE A TRANSCEIVER,
IT MEANS TO FIND YOU WILL TAKE MUCH LESS TIME.
AND SO THAT PUTS THE PEOPLE DOING THE RESCUE
AT MUCH LESS RISK.
¶¶
¶¶
CHECK, CHECK.
CHECK, CHECK.
¶¶
¶¶
THERE AT LEAST FIVE OUT HERE THAT ARE OUT OF THE DANGER ZONE,
AND THERE'S ANOTHER FOUR OR FIVE I CAN SEE
THAT ARE STILL IN THE DEPTHS OF THE ICEFALL.
Man
NOT SURE WHAT TEAM THEY'RE FROM.
PHIL, ARE ALL YOUR BOYS OKAY?
PHIL, I CAN'T HEAR YOU, BUT ARE ALL YOUR BOYS OKAY?
JUST SAY YES OR NO.
THUMBS UP.
OKAY.
THANKS.

BECAUSE HE'S ALIVE NOW.
YEAH, YEAH.
WE'LL TRY.

WE NEED ALL THAT.
WE NEED THE OXYGEN UP THERE FIRST FLIGHT.

YEAH.
I'LL TRY AND SECURE THE HELIPAD.

PLEASE LISTEN.
OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE MOUNTAIN GUIDES.
I'M A MOUNTAIN GUIDE.
WE'VE ALL GOT FRIENDS MISSING AND DEAD.
WE KNOW THAT, OKAY?
WE CAN'T GET EVERYTHING UP ON THE FIRST LOAD.
WE WANT TO SEND A DOCTOR.

DOCTOR AND ONE NEPALI GUIDE, OKAY?

THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST TRAGEDY
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED ON EVEREST.

WHERE 13 PEOPLE HAVE DIED ON EVEREST,

WHILE THE SEARCH FOR THE MISSING SHERPAS GOES ON.
¶¶
¶¶
AND YOU SEE THE GRIEF,
AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S GOING BACK DECADES.
YOU KNOW, THESE GRIEVING SHERPA FAMILIES --
THIS CONSTANT NARRATIVE OF LOSS BEING EXPRESSED AGAIN.
¶¶
Woman
FOR THREE OTHER PEOPLE
WHO ARE STILL MISSING FROM MOUNT EVEREST.
CREWS DID MANAGE TO RECOVER A 13th BODY OVERNIGHT.
TWO DAYS AGO, 16 PEOPLE DIED
INCLUDING ABOUT HALF OF OUR TEAM.
THIS MORNING, I THINK THE SHERPAS ARE TAKING MATTERS
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.
THEY'RE HOLDING A BIG MEETING AT BASE CAMP.
WE'VE JUST BEEN TOLD THAT THE SHERPAS ARE QUITE ANGRY
AND WE SHOULD GET BAGS READY
JUST IN CASE WE HAVE TO MAKE A SWIFT EXIT.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE SHERPAS ARE PERHAPS GONNA TARGET US
AS A FOCUS FOR THEIR ANGER -- WESTERNERS COMING HERE
AND CAUSING SUCH A KIND OF CIRCUS AT TIMES.
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY STILL-LINGERING TENSION
FROM LAST YEAR AND THE FIGHTS THAT BROKE OUT.
WE'RE HOPING THE SAME THING DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN THIS YEAR,
BUT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT FILMING HERE RIGHT NOW.
16 PEOPLE DYING AT THE SAME TIME --
IT'S A HUGE, HUGE SHOCK.
WHEN IT STARTED TO SINK IN,
THE ANGER GOT DISTINCTLY POINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT.
THEY FEEL THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN BENEFITING
OFF THE LABOR OF THE SHERPAS, THE LIVES OF THE SHERPAS,
AND NEVER PUT ANYTHING BACK.
NEPAL'S TOURISM INDUSTRY
IS WORTH $360 MILLION A YEAR.
SO WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OFFERS THE FAMILIES AROUND $400,
WHICH ISN'T EVEN ENOUGH TO COVER THEIR FUNERAL EXPENSES,
GRIEF TURNS TO ANGER VERY QUICKLY.
THE GOVERNMENT -- YOU KNOW, ONCE IT FIGURED OUT
THAT IT COULD SELL EVEREST AS MANY TIMES
AS IT LIKED EVERY YEAR RATHER THAN ONCE,
IT'S BASICALLY JUST SAT THERE,
OCCASIONALLY TWIDDLED AROUND THE EDGES
WHEN THERE WAS SOME BAD HEADLINES,
BUT BASICALLY NOT REALLY DONE ANYTHING SINCE.
THEY'VE LEFT IT TO WESTERN, YOU KNOW, OPERATORS
AND JUST TAKEN THEIR CUT EVERY YEAR, AND IT'S A BIG CUT.
IT'S LIKE 1/3 OF THE MONEY
THAT STAYS IN NEPAL FROM THIS BUSINESS
GOES TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE SHERPAS -- THEY'RE STILL TAKING THE RISKS.
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE ALWAYS TAKEN THE RISKS.
THEY'RE STILL TAKING THE RISKS.
THEY, QUITE REASONABLY, THINK THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
WE WORKED REALLY HARD THIS MORNING
TO SEND A LETTER TO THE MINISTRY
ASKING FOR BETTER CONDITIONS FOR THESE GUYS.
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT MIGHT PREEMPT
THIS TYPE OF MEETING THIS AFTERNOON.
OF COURSE WE'RE UPSET ABOUT PEOPLE DYING,
BUT THIS IS IRRATIONAL, YOU KNOW?
IT'S TOTALLY IRRATIONAL.
I DARE SAY THEY'D LOOK AT THE ARAB SUMMER
AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THINK
THAT THEY CAN DO THE SAME SORT OF THINGS.
IT'S HOT-HEADED YOUNG GUYS WHO REALLY DON'T HAVE
VERY MUCH EXPERIENCE ON THIS MOUNTAIN IN ANY CASE.
THEY'RE ANGRY, YES.
THEY ARE.
THEIR GRANDPARENTS AND THEIR FATHERS
HAVE WORKED HARD IN THE HIMALAYAS.
ALL THE HARD WORK HAS BEEN DONE BY THE SHERPAS,
WHICH IS NOT FAIR.
IT IS NOT FAIR.
Man
AND WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS NOT A DREAM.
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
WE HAD A -
- A DAY --
WE'VE ALL BEEN EXPECTING AN ACCIDENT,
AND WE HAD A VERY BAD DAY.
THE DAY THAT WE NEVER, EVER WANTED.
I AM AFRAID EVERY SINGLE DAY THE BOYS GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
I FEAR EVERY DAY, BUT, GUYS, WE ALSO HAVE TO PROGRESS.
WE HAVE TO PROGRESS FOR THE FUTURE.
OTHERWISE, YOU HAVE NO INCOME FOR YOUR FAMILIES.
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED THAT THE SHERPAS
COULD CONTEMPLATE GIVING UP A SEASON'S EARNING
IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR POINT.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST REQUESTS
FROM THE WORKERS IN THIS BASE CAMP
IS TO NOT CONTINUE CLIMBING THIS YEAR.
WE KNOW THAT'S A GREAT BIG ASK,
BUT IT'S SOMEWHAT SMALL COMPARED TO THE 16 LIVES
WE'VE LOST IN THIS MOUNTAIN.
THIS IS NOT WORKABLE FOR US.
WE'VE STILL GOT OUR SHERPAS TO COME TO TALK TO,
TO SEE IF WE WANT TO CARRY ON CLIMBING OR NOT.
WE CAN'T HAVE THIS HAPPENING EVERY TIME
THERE'S AN ACCIDENT EVERY SEASON.
IT'S GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.
WE'RE BEING FORCED OFF THIS MOUNTAIN BY RENEGADE SHERPAS.
WE ONLY BECAME A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY IN THE '90s,
SO PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE MORE FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
SO WHENEVER THEY SPEAK SOMETHING THAT IS A BIT MORE BOLD,
IT OBVIOUSLY TAKES THE WESTERN PEOPLE
WHO ARE THE BASE CAMP BY SURPRISE.
THEY'RE SAYING WHAT THEY THINK.
THEY'RE NOT REBELS.
THEY'RE JUST MOUNTAIN GUIDES.
I'M ASKING FOR A HELICOPTER
TO GO TO THE MINISTRY.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT TAKEN MUCH NOTICE IN THE PAST,
SO I THINK NOW'S THE TIME.
I THINK WE'RE CONFIDENT
THAT WE'RE GONNA RECOVER THE SITUATION,
BUT ONLY IF WE ACT RIGHT NOW.
¶¶
Man
WELL, IT BEGAN AS A TRAGEDY
AND HAS NOW TURNED INTO AN AVALANCHE OF RESENTMENT
THAT THREATENS THE ENTIRE EVEREST INDUSTRY.
Woman
THAT THREATENS TO SHUT DOWN NEXT MONTH'S CLIMBING SEASON.
Man
WHO ASSUME A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE PART OF THE RISK
GET A DISPROPORTIONATELY SMALL PART OF THE TAKE.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON, YOU KNOW?
WE HEAR FROM, YOU KNOW --
SIMON HEARS FROM THE EUROPEAN PAPERS
THAT THE SEASON'S OVER.
I HEAR FROM AMERICAN MEDIA
THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL STRIKE
AND THERE'S STILL NEGOTIATING GOING ON, BUT...
- WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, HUH?
- NOTHING.
WE CAN SIT IT,
AND YET WE DON'T KNOW A THING.
HE'S PAID FOR A HELICOPTER TO COME AND TAKE HIM
SO WE CAN GO TALK TO THE PEOPLE THAT CAN MAKE DECISIONS.
HE'S WORKING ON IT,
AND UNTIL THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE OVER,
THERE'S NOTHING BUT SPECULATION,
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING.
SORRY, GUYS.
I MEAN, IF I HAD MORE INFORMATION,
I WOULD GIVE IT TO YOU.
I'M GOING.
THERE'S AN INHERENT RISK IN MOUNTAINEERING.
THERE'S AN INHERENT RISK IN EVEREST.
THERE'S AN INHERENT RISK IN THE KHUMBU.
I KNOW THAT.
I'M WILLING TO ASSUME THAT RISK.
I THINK SOME OF THE CLIENTS
ARE GETTING A LITTLE RESTLESS,
BUT I THINK WE'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
AT THE RIGHT TIME,
AND WE'RE STILL GOING FORWARD ON OUR PLAN.
SO IF THE WORD IS "YES, YOUR CREW WILL GO WITH YOU,"
WE'RE STILL GOING FORWARD.
¶¶
Man
IS HANGING IN THE BALANCE THIS MORNING.
Woman
AND EASE TENSIONS AT BASE CAMP.
THERE WAS A LOT OF EXPECTATION
SURROUNDING THE MINISTERIAL VISIT.
THE SHERPAS HOPED THEY WOULD SHOW SOME LEADERSHIP
AND CANCEL THE SEASON.
THE CLIENTS HOPED THE GOVERNMENT
WOULD AGREE TO THE SHERPA DEMANDS
SO THE SEASON COULD CONTINUE.
Man
SO IN FAILING TO ACT DECISIVELY
OR TAKE ANY KIND OF OFFICIAL POSITION,
THE GOVERNMENT HAVE REALLY LEFT THE SHERPAS
BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.
...BUT JUST COMING TO BASE CAMP, THEY DON'T MAKE MONEY.
THEY MAKE MONEY ON THE MOUNTAIN, CARRYING LOADS UP THERE.
THE HIGHER THEY GO,
THE MORE THEY CARRY, THE MORE THEY'RE PAID.
JUST COMING TO BASE CAMP, THEY MAKE NOTHING.
BUT FOR THE LAST 61 YEARS, WE'VE WAITED.
SOMETHING HAD TO HAPPEN AND THEN WE HAD TO RAISE OUR VOICE
AND TO SUCH A HUGE LOSS.
THEY'RE READY TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES.
THEY'D RATHER LEAVE THAN DIE.
I THINK MANY EXPEDITION LEADERS FOUND THEMSELVES
IN AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT POSITION.
BALANCING THE INTERESTS OF CLIENTS AND THE SHERPAS
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WAS NEVER GOING TO BE EASY.
WHAT HAPPENED WAS REALLY A TRAGIC DAY,
A BLACK DAY.
I FEEL STILL POSITIVE
IF WE'RE GONNA BE ALLOWED TO GO UP THE MOUNTAIN, YOU KNOW,
AND CONTINUE THE JOURNEY AND HOPEFULLY IT'S SUCCESSFUL
AND YOU KNOW, LIFE GOES ON,
AND JUST TRY TO REMEMBER THE GUYS FOR WHAT THEY WERE
AND CARRY A POSITIVE MESSAGE.
I KNEW THE RISKS.
FROM A PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW, I WAS PREPARED TO TAKE THAT,
BUT TO ASK THE SHERPA BOYS
TO GO THROUGH IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN,
IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE.
IT'S HARD JUST TO --
NOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE FAMILIES,
THOSE BOYS.
THEY'RE DOING IT FOR US.
BUT I PUT SO MUCH WORK INTO THIS AND EFFORT.
THEN YOU START TO JUSTIFY IT.
FOR US, IT'S DéJà VU, ISN'T IT, JEFF?
YEAH.
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS, YOU KNOW?
THIS WAS 2012.
ACTUALLY, WHAT RUSSELL FEARED WOULD HAPPEN IN 2012
IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
TO HAVE TO COME BACK HERE A SECOND TIME
ONLY TO GET CANCELED AGAIN AND NEVER GIVEN THE SHOT IS --
YEAH, THAT'LL BE -
- THAT'LL BE DEVASTATING TO ME, I THINK.
YEAH.
Woman
SHERPAS ARE LEADING A BOYCOTT AFTER THAT DEADLY AVALANCHE.
Man
WHO MIGHT WANT TO CONTINUE VERY, VERY CHALLENGING.
Woman
THEY PAID FOR THE JOURNEY.
THAT CAN TOP $75,000.
I FLEW BACK AGAIN HERE THIS MORNING
TO FIND THAT I'M PROBABLY THE LAST TEAM TO DECIDE
WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUING ON THE MOUNTAIN
OR NOT.
YES, WE HAD ONE AVALANCHE.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE.
BUT THAT'S NO REASON TO STOP THE EXPEDITION.
TODAY, A DELEGATION -- THEY CAME TO THE BASE CAMP
TO TRY AND CALM THINGS DOWN.
BUT I'M AFRAID IT JUST ESCALATED THINGS.
IT DIDN'T HELP.
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ONLY A GROUP OF FOUR OR FIVE GUYS
THAT ARE CAUSING THIS PROBLEM,
BUT THEN THEY EXCITE 300-ODD GUYS,
AND WHEN YOU HAVE MOB RULE, WHAT CAN WE DO?
EFFECTIVELY,
WHAT THESE MILITANT SHERPAS ARE SAYING IS --
IF OUR SHERPAS GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL,
THEY'LL BEAT THEM UP.
THEN WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE FIGHTING ON EVEREST LAST YEAR.
WE WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME FORM OF PUNISHMENT
TO THESE GUYS.
OR WE NEED TO GET RID OF THEM, OUT OF THIS SYSTEM
SO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
YOU KNOW WHO EMPLOYS THEM, RUSS?
THESE FOUR OR FIVE?
I KNOW WHO EMPLOYS SOME OF THEM, YEAH.
AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN TALK TO THEIR OWNERS
AND -
- I MEAN, IF THIS WAS ONE OF YOUR SHERPAS,
YOU COULD HAVE THEM REMOVED FROM THE MOUNTAIN.
WELL, I WOULD.
YES.
SO...
BUT, YES.
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
THESE PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY IRRATIONAL.
THEY DON'T CARE.
NEXT WEEK OR NEXT MONTH,
THEY'LL BE AT HOME WITH NOTHING TO EAT.
WE HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE
AS OUR SHERPAS ARE STILL PREPARED TO GO UP THE MOUNTAIN.
AS FAR AS I KNOW, OUR SHERPAS WANT TO CLIMB.
BUT THEY FEAR FOR THEIR LIFE.
PHURBA WILL BE HERE EARLY TOMORROW.
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS EVERYTHING WITH HIM.
SO, SORRY, GUYS.
THAT'S IT.
¶¶
- OH, NAMASTE.
- NAMASTE.
HOW'S IT GOING?
OKAY.
HOW YOU DOING?
SHERPAS ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO EXPRESS THEIR EMOTIONS
VERY WILLINGLY.
SO IT'S SOMETIMES HARD TO READ THEM.
LOTS OF ATTENTION ON YOU NOW.
IT'S OKAY.
JUST RELAX.
LET'S HAVE A CUP OF TEA FIRST, HUH?
NAMASTE.
SO, HOW'S EVERYONE AT HOME?
UPSET?
- A BIT UPSET.
- YEAH.
I KNOW.
JUST --
UNDERSTANDABLY, YOU KNOW.
MM-HMM.
AND WIVES.
HOW DO WIVES FEEL?
DON'T WANT YOU COMING OR --
HOW THEY WANT -- HOW THEY SAY?
THEY ARE HAPPY THAT WE'RE BACK, BUT THEY'RE STILL AFRAID --
AFRAID.
AFRAID, TOO, THAT WE'RE GOING BACK AGAIN.
YEAH.
I'M SURE.
WE'RE ALL AFRAID.
YEAH.
WE'RE ALL AFRAID, PHURBA.
SO.
WHAT TO DO.
WANT TO GO NORTH SIDE?
- STILL VERY RISKY.
- HUH?
THERE'S RISK EVERY TIME.
DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WE GO.
MM-HMM.
SO, UM...
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.
YOU WANT TO CLIMB,
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE AND EVERYTHING.
YEAH.
ALTHOUGH, I CHECKED WITH ALL THE BUDDHISTS AND HINDU.
YOU KNOW, IF WE RESPECT,
THEN WE CAN CARRY ON DOING OUR WORK,
BUT WHAT WE FEEL HERE IS DANGER
FOR YOU FROM OTHER SHERPA.
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?
- NO, I DIDN'T.
- DIDN'T HEAR THAT?
SO, FOR ME, I FEEL AFRAID FOR YOU.
WE FEEL DANGER FOR YOU GUYS IF YOU CARRY ON CLIMBING,
BUT MAYBE LATER, SOME VIOLENCE TO YOU --
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT.
'CAUSE THIS IS NOT NORMAL SHERPA.
HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL?
MAYBE YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME.
AND IF YOU'RE ANGRY, THEN YOU HAVE TO TELL ME,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I THINK PRESSURE COMING FROM OUTSIDE --
AND I'M AFRAID FOR YOU.
SO, I THINK WE HAVE TO STOP EXPEDITION.
YOU AGREE?
- MM-HMM.
YOU AGREE TO STOP EXPEDITION?
- YEAH.
- EVERYONE?
- YES.
- YEAH?
SO I HAVE TO TELL THE MEMBERS LIKE THAT?
MM-HMM.
I DON'T WANT, BUT ALSO, IF JUST US,
HOW CAN I AFFORD ALL THE ROPE?
BECAUSE I HAVE TO BUY FROM EXPEDITION OPERATORS.
SO, FOR ME, I CAN'T AFFORD JUST US.
YOU KNOW, BEFORE IT WAS ALWAYS FRIENDLY,
SMILING SHERPA, ALWAYS HELPING.
THESE GUYS HAVE SPOILED YOUR REPUTATION.
OKAY.
WHAT TO DO NOW.
I HAVE TO GO AND TELL MEMBERS WE'RE FINISHED.
MM-HMM.
YOU KNOW, MY PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU.
SAD.
GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
SO GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE.
SO, AS I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT,
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE
AND THE SHERPAS FEEL UNDER TOO MUCH THREAT.
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN TOLD IF THEY GO THROUGH ICEFALL,
THEY'LL BREAK THEIR LEGS.
SO...
THIS IS THE WORD THAT COMES TO THEM
THAT THESE OTHER GUYS UP HERE WILL BREAK THEIR LEGS
IF THEY GO THROUGH THE ICEFALL.
YES, THEY WANT TO CLIMB.
OUT OF RESPECT, THEY DON'T WANT TO CLIMB,
AND OUT OF FEAR, THEY DON'T WANT TO CLIMB.
NOT FEAR OF THE MOUNTAIN.
FEAR OF THE PEOPLE.
SO THERE YOU GO, GUYS.
WHAT CAN I SAY?
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
AND PHURBA DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
AND WE'RE PISSED OFF.
WE'RE ANGRY THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE RUINING OUR BUSINESS,
YOU KNOW?
THEIR BUSINESS.
WHAT CAN WE DO?
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.
I...
DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME TWICE.
OKAY.
SO, NOW HOW TO GET OUT OF HERE.
ESSENTIALLY, WE WERE JUST GIVEN THE NEWS
THAT THE SHERPAS' LEGS WOULD BE BROKEN
IF THEY WERE TO HELP US
GET UP THIS MOUNTAIN.
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY ARGUE WITH THAT ONE?
BEING HELD CAPTIVE BY TERRORISTS, IS HOW I LOOK AT IT.
I MEAN, WHEN PEOPLE DEMAND CHANGE
AND THREATEN IT BY VIOLENCE, THAT'S A TERRORIST, YOU KNOW.
AND WE IN THE STATES, WE KNOW WHAT THAT IS --
AFTER 9/11.
WE'VE GOT A GROUP HERE THAT'S TERRORIZING BASE CAMP.
HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT, YOU KNOW?
HOW DO YOU --
HOW DO YOU MENTALLY PREPARE YOURSELF
TO GET UP HERE AND THEN BE TURNED AWAY
BECAUSE A GROUP OF TERRORISTS ARE DEMANDING
THAT WESTERNERS LEAVE BASE CAMP?
YOU KNOW, IT'S -
- IT'S HARD.
DO I HAVE IT IN ME FOR A THIRD TIME
TO TRY TO COME BACK AND DO EVEREST?
I'VE GOT TO GO TALK WITH MY FAMILY, I THINK,
BEFORE I MAKE ANY FINAL DECISIONS.
BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO GET TO THE TOP
OF THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD
AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT LEGACY TO MY FAMILY
AS SOMETHING THEY --
NOW YOU GOT ME.
Man
WE'LL BE BACK HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR.
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
I'LL TACK THE TOP OF THAT MOUNTAIN AT SOME POINT,
SO...
JUST A SLIGHT SETBACK.
I'M GONNA FEEL BETTER WHEN I GO HOME KNOWING
THAT WE DIDN'T CLIMB UP THAT MOUNTAIN
AFTER THE BIG TRAGEDY.
IT'S JUST BETTER TO SHOW MY RESPECT
FOR THE SHERPA COMMUNITY BY LEAVING.
I THINK THE EXPEDITION ORGANIZERS --
THEY KNEW IN THEIR HEART WHAT THEIR SHERPA WANTS,
BUT THEY COULDN'T TELL THAT CLEARLY TO THEIR CLIENTS.
IT'S JUST THE EXCUSES THEY ARE USING
TO THROW THE BLAME ON SOMEBODY ELSE, YEAH.
¶¶
IF THIS DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING, THEN NOTHING EVER WILL.
THEN NEPAL WILL JUST BE LIKE THE WILD, WILD WEST
FOR THE WESTERN OPERATORS TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.
THIS THING HAS HAPPENED, WHICH IS A SAD THING,
BUT HOPEFULLY, THIS WILL BRING SOMETHING POSITIVE
INTO THE MOUNTAIN.
IT MUST HAVE SOME EFFECT OF THE EVEREST INDUSTRY --
THE ACCIDENT THIS YEAR.
I THINK THIS MADE ME MORE DETERMINED
TO TRY AND CHANGE THE RULES
SO WE CAN CONTINUE WITH EVEREST AS USUAL BUT IN A SAFER WAY.
I'VE BEEN A MOUNTAIN GUIDE ALL MY LIFE.
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH DEATH A LOT, AND THEN TRY AND MOVE ON.
HOPEFULLY, WE WILL HAVE A TEAM
TO GO TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST AGAIN NEXT YEAR.
¶¶
THE GAME SHIFTED.
IT WOULD BE EASY IN THE CHAOS OF THIS LAST WEEK
TO LOSE SIGHT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE.
THE SHERPAS HAVE EFFECTIVELY CANCELED THE SEASON.
THEY HAD A CHOICE, AND IN THE END,
THEY'VE CHOSEN RESPECT FOR THEMSELVES AND THE MOUNTAIN
AHEAD OF MONEY.
CANCELING THE SEASON WILL BE A WELCOMED BREATHING SPACE.
SO MAYBE IT WILL BE CALMER.
IT WILL BE NICE FOR EVEREST TO BE CALM FOR A BIT
RATHER THAN THIS KIND OF MADNESS.
MY FATHER SAID THAT YOU DON'T CONQUER
THESE MOUNTAINS, YOU KNOW?
YOU JUST CRAWL UP,
AS A CHILD CRAWLING TO YOUR MOTHER'S LAP,
WHICH IS THE SAME APPROACH I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE.
THEN THERE'D BE LESS ACCIDENTS.
HE WAS THE FIRST ASIAN TO BECOME FAMOUS,
KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD,
AND HE BECAME A GREAT METAPHOR FOR YOUNG MEN
ALL ALIKE TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN,
HARD WORK IS WHAT IT TAKES.
AND SO HE BECAME A REAL SYMBOL OF HOPE
FOR MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD.
¶¶
¶¶
TENZING GAVE THE NAME SHERPA A CURRENCY
WHICH WILL NEVER BE EXHAUSTED.
SO IT MAY ONLY BE NOW
THAT THEY'RE REALLY BEGINNING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.
THEY'VE GOT CONTROL OF CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN,
AND IT'S COME FULL CIRCLE IN A WAY.
MY FATHER SAID HE CLIMBED
SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO.
HE WANTED TO GIVE US THE BEST EDUCATION
SO WE COULD CONTINUE OUR LIVES IN SOME OTHER CAREERS
RATHER THAN CLIMBING.
BECAUSE CLIMBING WAS DANGEROUS.

this is an astonishingly chance relationship between western climbers and the sherpas.
When climbing began, the sherpas had no conception of what mountaineering might be, and yet, suddenly they were on this journey from being people who just genetically were really good at altitude to becoming, you know, international mountain guides 100 years later.
1953 -- coronation year.
The world was turned by the news atth everest had at last been conquered by a british expedition lebyd colonel john hunt.
Accompanied by the famous sherpa tenzing, edmund hillary climbed the summit of the world's highest mountain.
When tenzing norgay reached the summit of everest, that is such an amazing moment.
It's one of the most beautiful moments in climbing history.
That's the moment when the word "sherpa"
has the meaning of brand in the way that we understand it.
The world was captivated by tenzing.
And he fixed in our minds the popular image of a sherpa, as this smiling, friendly, almost heroic figure.
A lot of the western world do not know what a sherpa is.
So, a sherpa, you know -- you climb mountains, you know?
And that's the first instinct, but they have no idea that we are actually an ethnic group of people.
We believe in reincarnation -- life after death.
And you continue to be reborn and reborn and reborn until the day you reach nirvana.
So, your next life is determined by your deeds of this life.
We sherpa people have a great respect for the mountain.
Over here, we climb mountains, but it's a holy place.
There's a huge difference in, you know, the attitude, the feeling.
Western people approach it as a physical challenge -- push your limit to see how close you can get to death.
But there's 1,000-year-old stories we have about the mountain, its history, which these people have no idea about.
And i think some people adapt and learn and respect it.
Some people don't.
If phurba is one of the most successful climbing sherpas of his generation, then his counterpart amongst expedition leaders is his boss, russell brice.
I've been running commercial expeditions here since 1994.
I think i'm the person that's been on more everest expeditions than anyone else in the world.
It's all oxygen.
- All oxygen.
And i brought those two broken ones in kathmandu.
How can i explain phurba tashi?
This year, he might climb everest 22 times -- more than anyone else in the world -- and such a special person.
He's incredibly strong on the mountain.
Good idea.
Hot water here.
Easy to come from the kitchen.
Hi, guys.
Lots of new faces.
¶¶
the service-industry aspect of climbing everest has developed and developed.
So what mountaineers in 1975 maybe would have put up with, the people who are coming now want something a bit more.
You know, they want a very comfortable base camp.
Everhiytng's good.
So much work for these guys to make all these platforms and put tents up.
The activity here hachs anged utterly.
It has become an industry, and that industry is people, largely, by sherpas.
And they may not still fully understand what it is that compels us to climb mountains, but they are fantastically good at delivering the experience.
¶¶
so f, arso good, actually.
Everybody's looking and sounding quite healthy.
A couple mild headaches, but that's to be expected.
Okay, folks.
Let's roll on out of town.
¶¶
in the old days, people did everything on the mountain together.
And today, the mountain has changed in that the operators take care of everything.
In the old days, if you got one person on the summit, that was success.
Now, we need to get everyone on the summit.
So if you want to get everyone on the summit, you need much more creature comfort.
Certainly the type of person that comes on an expedition has changed considerably.
We bring people here to help them fulfill their dreams.
Hey!
Yeah!
Phurba, how's it going?
Good to see you.
You boys have done hard work.
Oh!
Hey, phurba.
Peter.
How are you?
It's been a algo as a climber.
I know to a lot of climbers, it might be trivial, but to me, being on top of everest is just an achievement of a dream.
Part of the reason why you want to come and cmbli -- you want to experience those things, see if you can do it, see if you can physically do it.
It's a massive undertaking.
The training is phenomenal.
And, you know, it's not something you put together in a couple weeks.
It's months of planning and months of getting organized.
Have you ever seen a man so particular?
Man man and so, for just eight hectic weeks each year, everest base camp becomes this thriving village.
And in recent years, overcrowding on everest has been the source of a lot of controversy.
It might just be the last place on earth you'd expect to find a traffic jam -- the top of the world -- mount everest.
Man cause long and unnecessary delays.
Man 600 people do it in a good year.
It has become a very necessary part of the nepalese economy.
Man to clients wanting to make the ascent.
Man and a multi-million-dollar industry.
This is a, you know, big employer -- lots and lots of people.
There are more sherpas working on the mountain now than there ever have been in history.
But they only get a small fraction of the pie.
Man for a two-month expedition,
10 times the average annual pay in their isolated homeland.
The whole everest circus just seems to get bigger and bigger, and this season is no exception.
Russell brice's team isus jt one of 38 expeditions on the mountain this year.
All these people have to be looked after, and all their equipment has to be moved up the mountain.
You have google maps photographing the route to the summit.
There's a hollywood feature film.
There's even a guy in a wingsuit trying to jump off the top and fly all the way down.
It's kind of daft, but in the world of adventure, people are always thinking of new crazy things to do.
It's part of the deal now -- is that they're all kinds of strange notions of what can be done on everest simply to attract attention.
One, two, three.
The way these commercial expeditions climb everest is to establish a series of higher and higher camps, stocking them over a period of weeks with everything required to give the clients the best chance of reaching the summit.
The government doesn't permit equipment to be flown up the mountain, so everything that goes into building these camps has to be carried.
And it's the sherspa that do that work, including going through what is its most dangerous section.
¶¶
if you want to climb everest from the south, you have to go through the khumbu icefall.
The khumbu icefall is like a waterfall of ice coming out of the western cwm.
There is nowhere else in the world that a mountaineer wouldo g through an icefall like this.
But because it's the only acce sson the south side to everest, then peoe pldo walk through this jumble of ice.
The problem with the icefall is that it's uncontrollable.
All the other aspects of the mountain that are dangerous have, you know, in terms of safety, have been improved over the years.
But the icefall remains, you know, perilous.
¶¶
not only that -- there are big blocks of ice falling down without warning from above.
You're asking men to go to work in a very dangerous environment.
And it's becoming more so as the seracs, these giant blocks of glacial ice, are affected by the forces of climate change.
They're dropping off more readily, and people are going to get caught more often.
So you know that this is a perilous moment -- going through the icefall.
Man
and it's not just once or twice the sherpas have to go through it.
It's up to 30 trips per season, as compared to about two or three for most foreigners.
I'm totally scared every time i send the sherpas up in e thmountain.
It's like sending them off to war.
I don't know who's gonna come home.
If there's an accident in the icefall, are we gonna lose one?
Are we gonna lose two?
Are we gonna lose six people?
Because the potential is there.
And the question is -- what is the moral justification for that?
You know, what reward is there for you to play what is essentially a game of russian roulette?
Tenzing norgay was a man who was determined to change his stars.
And when he reached the summit of everest, he did that.
The british couldn't have done it with someone like tenzing.
He'd been to the mountain seven times by that point, and they benefited from a tllhose years of his experience, but he wasn't acknowledged.
He wasn't given due regard for what he had achieved.
Coming down from that, almost immediately, he finds himself in a political firestorm.
Who got tohe t top first?
To anybody who climbs mountains, to any mountaineer, and i feel to thousands of others.
The matter couldn't matter less.
Reporter his chilly answers had to be interpreted.
He's very happy.
Reporter so john hunt became sir john hunt, hillary became sir ed hillary, and tenzing got the george medal.
Now, there is a superior award to that -- the george cross.
So it's kind of like a second-level award.
It was just not right.
So in the eyes of sherpas, in the eyes of people in india, in the eyes of most asians, they felt somewhat slighted that he would not get the same kind of recognition that his partners got on everest.
He was immensely proud of what he had achieved, but i think he felt thwarted in a way.
I think he felt that he hadn't realized himself in the way that he would have liked.
I think partly it's because, you know, he lackea d formal education.
The 60-year-old reputation of what it is to be a sherpa is changing.
Now, you go to base camp and more than 80 % of sherpas finish their high school.
And if you go 20 years ago, none of them have been to high school.
Because of their education, they know a lot more than western clients think they do.
Now with the facebook generation, sherpas see how much credit westerners are getting for a climb on everest, and they know that they've done most of the grunt work.
Without the sherpa, the westerner would never have gotten there.
And they are dissatisfied with that.
And they want equal credit for what they have done.
What we've seen in recent years is a... a tendency of aggression from younger sherpas.
So, last year, there was fighting on everest, and i think we were all disappointed, so sad about that.
Man trying to climb mount everest.
This morning, some of them say they nearly died in a brawl.
Man versus the mountain to man versus man.
Man man had to flee for their lives.
Man man at an altitude of roughly 22,000 feet.
You have a european calling a sherpa a... which is, in nepal, particularly, culturally insensitive.
Man i don't like that word, either.
Man turned against them.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for all what they said.
All the words that came out from my mouth was wrong.
I am sorry.
Yes.
Please.
Please, no violence.
No.
- He came to apologize.
I'm sorry.
Yes, yes.
Please, no violence.
Listen.
He's very sorry.
No!
Inside, inside.
Hey!
Man or reflected a greater discontent.
Please, no violence.
Please!
¶¶
it's about sherpas no longer feeling that they have to be subservient or deferent to western climbers and not playing out that role of the faithful servant anymore.
Not being the kind of nice, friendly, smiley person in the background.
Just saying, "actually, you know what?
We're as good as you."
I'm a little afraid where it's going to lead in the future.
It's too hard.
The tension is too hard.
The worry is too hard.
And i'm getting too old for that.
¶¶
- good morning.
- Good morning, mount everest.
Hot towel.
Tea?
Ow.
Roughin' it on mount everest.
Hot towels and tea in the morning.
Ah.
¶¶ can i have a tea with no sugar, please?
¶¶
the reason everest takes eight weeks to climb is that the body needs to slowly acclimatize to the altitude.
We do our acclimatization on lobuche peak to stay out of the icefall, to reduce the risk for our clients.
And so when, you know, russell brice starts getting his clients to camp on top of, you know, a nearby peak rather than going through the icefall to acclimatize, you know, that makes sense.
The fewer trips anyone has to make through the icefall, the better.
Meanwhile, the sherpas are still stocking the camps on everest, making dozens of trips up and down, carrying all the oxygen, the tes, nt the food, so on.
So that the mountain is ready to be climbed when the clients return.
This year, my clients will go through the icefall twice, but i daresay most of the sherpas will go through maybe 20 to 30 times.
And i'm not sure the clients actually er vesee that.
That was a nice day fo r a climb.
¶¶
i think a lot of people, even on our trips, don'ret ally understand all this work is going on every night.
Loads of equipment going up to support them on the mountain.
But now we have to start the real job of why we're here, and that's going up th rough the mountain.
Safety is very, very important.
If you go through the icefall without crampons, if you go through the icefall without clipping on, i'm gonna sack you.
You're gonna go home.
You have to remember that you have a big responsibility not only for your own safety, but for your family.
Even if it's a full moon, you must have your headlamp.
The transceivers must be turned on here, and you must use the transceiver... every day that you go through the icefall.
We know if a serac falls on top of you you're not going to survive, but if you have a transceiver, it means to find you will take much less time.
And so that puts the people doing the rescue at much less risk.
¶¶
¶¶
check, check.
Check, check.
¶¶
¶¶
there at least five out here that are out othf e danger zone, and there's another four or five i can see that are still in the depths of the icefall.
Man not sure what team they're from.
Phil, are all your boys okay?
Phil, i can't hear you, but are all your boys okay?
Just say yes or no.
Thumbs up.
Okay.
Thanks.
Man russ, where's that -- a.c. and a.a.i.
dawa sherpa, a.c. sherpa, and a.a.i. sherpa.

We don't have a casualty count now.
We're working on live bodies at the moment.

this is by far the worst tragedy that's ever happened on everest.
13 people have died this morning.
And there may be more still that we don't know about.
There hasn't been a year in history where 13 people have died on everest, let alone in one day.
Man michael has done an examination on all bodies.
No signs of life.
I daresay -- this is the day that we just all dreaded.
Woman shattered.
Every village will be affected.
A lot of our guys will have friends they know.
There's people from all over the khumbu.
Man woman at about 6:30 this morning local time at one of the busiest times of day on the mountain.
Man on the world's tallest mountain.
Woman man man of this year's climbing season and whether attempts will be made next month.
Man which is already estimated at 250.
Man while the search for the missing sherpas goes on.
¶¶
¶¶
you see the grief, and, you know, that's going back decades.
You know, these grieving sherpa families -- this constant narrative of loss being expressed again.
¶¶
woman for three other people who are still missing from mount everest.
Crews did manage to recover a 13th body overnight.
Two days ago, 16 people died including about half of our team.
This morning, i think the sherpas are taking matters into their own hands.
They're holding a big meeting at base camp.
We've just been told that the sherpas are quite angry and we should get bags ready just in case we have to make a swift exit.
We don't know if the sherpas are perhaps gonna target us as a focus for their anger -- westerners coming here and causing such a kind of circus at times.
I don't know if there's any still-ngliering tension from last year and the fights that broke out.
We're hoping the same thing doesn't happen again this year, but we're concerned about filming here right now.
16 people dying at the same time -- it's a huge, huge shock.
When it started to sink in, the anger got distinctly pointed at the government.
They feel that the government has always been benefiting off the labor of the sherpas, the lives of the sherpas, and never put anything back.
Nepal's tourism industry is worth $360 million a year.
So when the government offers the families around $400, which isn't even enough to cover their funeral expenses, grief turns to anger very quickly.
The government -- you know, once it figured out that it could sell everest as many times as it liked every year rather than once, it's basically just sat there, occasionally twiddled around the edges when there was some bad headlines,
but basically not really done anything since.
They've left it to western, you know, operators and just taken their cut every year, and it's a big cut.
It's like 1/3 of the money that stays in nepal from this business goes to the government.
The sherpas -- they're still taking the risks.
You know, they've always taken the risks.
They're still taking the risks.
They, quite reasonably, think that's outrageous.
We worked really hard this morning to send a letter to the ministry asking for better conditions for these guys.
I would have thought that might preempt this type of meeting this afternoon.
Of course we're upset about people dying, but this is irrational, you know?
It's totally irrational.
I daresay they'd look at the arab summer and things like that and think that they can do the same sort of things.
It's hotheaded young guys who really don't have very much experience on this mountain in any case.
They're angry, yes.
They are.
Their grandparents and their fathers have worked hard in the himalayas.
All the hard work has been done by the sherpas, which is not fair.
It is not fair.
Man and we realize that this is not a dream.
I'm sorry.
I don't really know what to say.
We had a -- a day -- the day that we never, ever wanted.
Every single day, the boys go through the icefall.
I fear every day, but, guys, we also have to progress
.
Every single day, the boys go through the icefall.
We have to progress for the future.
Otherwise, you have no income for your families.
This is unprecedented that the sherpas could contemplate giving up a season's earning in order to make their point.
This is not workable for us.
We've still got our sherpas to come to talk to, to see if we want to carry on climbing or not.
We can't have this happening every time there's an accident every season.
It's getting out of control.
We only became a democratic country in the '90s, so people feel like they have morere fedom of speech.
So whenever they speak something that is a bit more bold, it obviously takes the western people who are the base camp by surprise.
They're saying what they think.
They're not rebels.
They're just mountain guides.
I'm asking for a helicopter to go to the ministry.
The government has not taken much notice in the past, so i think now's the time.
I think we're coidnfent that we're gonna recover the situation, but only if we act right now.
¶¶
man well, it began as a tragedy and has now turned into an avalanche of resentment that threatens the entire everest industry.
Woman that threatens to shut down next month's climbing season.
Man who assume a disproportionately large part of the risk get a disproportionately small part of the take.
I'd like to know a little bit about what's going on, you know?
We hear from, you know -- simon hears from the european papers that the season's over.
I hear from american media that there's a potential strike and there's still negotiating going on, but...
- we don't know anything, huh?
- Nothing.
We can sit it, and yet we don't know a thing.
He's paid for a helicopter to come and take him so we can go talk to the people that can make decisions.
He's working on it, and until those discussions are over, there's nothing but speculation, which is exactly what we're doing.
Sorry, guys.
I mean, if i had more information, i would give it to you.
I'm going.
There's an inherent risk in mountaineering.
There's an inherent risk in everest.
There's an inherent risk in the khumbu.
I know that.
I'm willing to assume that risk.
I think some of the clients are getting a little restless, but i think we're in the right place at the right time, and we're still going forward on our plan.
So if the word is "yes, your crew will go with you,"
we're still going forward.
¶¶ man is hanging in the balance this morning.
Woman and ease tensions at base camp.
There was a lot of expectaonti surrounding the ministerial visit.
The sherpas hoped they would show some leadership and cancel the season.
The clients hoped the government would agree to the sherpa demands so the season could continue.
Man
so in failing to act decisively or take any kind of official position, the government have really left the sherpas between a rock and a hard place.
...but just coming to base camp, they don't make money.
They make money on the mountain, carrying loads up there.
The higher they go, the more they carry, the more they're paid.
Just coming to base camp, they make nothing.
But for the last 61 years, we've waited.
Something had to happen and then we had to raise our voice and to such a huge loss.
They're adrey to face the consequences.
They'd rather leave than die.
I think many expedition leaders found themselves in an incredibly difficult position.
Balancing the interests of clients and the sherpas in a situation like this was never going to be easy.
What happened was really a tragic day, a black day.
I feel still positive if we're gonna be allowed to go up the mountain, you know, and continue the journey and hopefully it's successful and, you know, life goes on, and just try to remember the guys for what they were
and carry a positive message.
I knew the risks.
From a personal point of view, i was prepared to take that, but to ask the sherpa boys to go through it time and time again, it's a difficult one.
It's hard just to -- not to think about what happened to all those families, those boys.
They're doing it for us.
But i put so much work into this and effort.
Then you start to justify it.
Woman sherpas are leading a boycott after that deadly avalanche.
Man who might want to continue very, very challenging and difficult.
Woman they paid for the journey.
That can top $75,000.
I flew back again here this morning to find that i'm probably the last team to decide whether we're going to be continuing on the mountain or not.
Yes, we had one avalanche.
Unfortunately, it killed a lot of people.
Bu t that's no reason to stop the expedition.
Today, a delegation -- they came to the base camp to try and calm things down.
But i'm afraid it just escalated things.
It didn't help.
We know that there's only a group of four or five guys that are -- that are causing this problem, but then they excite 300-odd guys, and when you have mob rule, what can we do?
Effectively, what these militant sherpas are saying is -- if our sherpas go through the icefall, they'll beat them up.
Then we all know about the fighting on everest last year.
We would hope that there will be some form of punishment to these guys.
Or we need to get rid of them, out of this system so it doesn't happen again.
You know who employs them, russ?
These four or five?
I know who employs some of them, yeah.
And there's no way you can talk to their owners and -- i mean, if this was one of your sherpas, you could have them removed from the mountain.
Well, i would.
Yes.
So... but, yes.
But i don't know how to do that.
These people are totally irrational.
They don't care.
Next week or next month, they'll be at home with nothing to eat.
We have one last chance as our sherpas are still prepared to go up the mountain.
As far as i know, our sherpas want to climb.
But they fear for their life.
Phurba will be here early tomorrow.
We have to discuss everything with him.
So, sorry, guys.
That's it.
¶¶
- oh, namaste.
- Namaste.
How's it going?
Okay.
How you doing?
Sherpas are not people who express their emotions very willingly.
So it's sometimes hard to read them.
Lots of attention on you now.
It's okay.
Just relax.
Let's have a cup of tea first, huh?
Namaste.
So, how's everyone at home?
Upset?
- A bit upset.
- Yeah.
I know.
Just -- understandably, you know.
Mm-hmm.
And wives.
How do wives feel?
Don't want you coming or -- how they want -- how they say?
They are happy that we're back, but they're still afraid -- afraid.
Afraid, too, that we're going back again.
Yeah.
I'm sure.
We're all afraid.
Yeah.
We're all afraid, phurba.
So.
What to do.
Want to go north side?
- Still very risky.
- Huh?
There's risk every time.
Doesn't matter where we go.
Mm-hmm.
So, um... i understand how you feel.
You want to climb, but you also have respect for the people and everything.
Yeah.
Although, i checked with all the buddhists and hindu.
You know, if we respect, then we can carry on doing our work, but what we feel here is danger for you from other sherpa.
Did you hear anything about that?
- No, i didn't.
- Didt n'hear that?
So, for me, i feel afraid for you.
We feel danger for you guys if you carry on climbing, but maybe later, some violence to you -- how you feel about that.
'Cause this is not normal sherpa.
How do you guys feel?
Maybe you're angry with me.
And if you're angry, then you have to tell me
, maybe you're angry with me.
But, you know, i think pressure coming from outside -- and i'm afraid for you.
So, i think we have to stop expedition.
You agree?
- Mm-hmm.
You agree to stop expedition?
- Yeah.
- Everyone?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
So i have to tell the members like that?
Mm-hmm.
I don't want, but also, if just us, how can i afford all the rope?
Because i have to buy from expedition operators.
So, for me, i can't afford just us.
You know, before it was always friendly, smiling sherpa, always helping.
These guys have spoiled your reputation.
Okay.
What to do now.
I have to go and tell members we're finished.
Mm-hmm.
You know, my prayers are with you.
Sad.
Glad you're okay.
So glad to see you here.
So, as i told you last night, it's unlikely that we would continue and the sherpas feel under too much threat.
They've already been told if they go through icefall, they'll break their legs.
So... this is the word that comes to them that these other guys up here will break their legs if they go through the icefall.
Yes, they want to climb.
Out of respect, they don't want to climb, and out of fear, they don't want to climb.
Not fear of the mountain.
Fear of the people.
So there you go, guys.
What can i say?
And i don't know what to do.
And phurba doesn't know what to do.
And we're pissed off.
We're angry that these people are ruining our business, you know?
Their business.
What can we do?
I don't know how to apologize to you.
I... don't know how to do that.
Okay.
So, now how to get out of here.
Essentially, we were just given the news that the sherpas' legs would be broken if they were to help us get up this mountain.
How can you possibly argue with that one?
Being held captive by terrorists, is how i look at it.
I mean, when people demand change and threaten it by violence, that's a terrorist, you know?
And we in the states, we know what that is -- after 9/11.
We've got a group here that's terrorizing base camp.
How do you anticipate that, you know?
How do you -- how do you mentally prepare yourself to get up here and then be turned away because a group of terrorists are demanding that westerners leave base camp?
You know, it's -- it's hard.
I certainly would like to get to the top of the highest mountain in the world and be able to provide that legacy to my family as something they -- now you got me.
Man we'll be back hopefully next year.
One way or another, i'll tack the top of that mountain at some point, so...
just a slight setback.
I'm gonna feel better when i go home knowing that we didn't climb up that mountain after the big tragedy.
It's just better to show my respect for the sherpa community by leaving.
I think the expedition organizers -- they knew in their heart what their sherpa wants, but they couldn't tell that clearly to their clients.
It's just the excuses they are using to throw the blame on somebody else, yeah.
¶¶
if this didn't change anything, then nothing ever will.
Then nepal will just be like the wild, wild west for the western operators to do whatever they want.
This thing has happened, which is a sad thing, but hopefully, this will bring something positive into the mountain.
It must have some effect of the everest industry -- the accident this year.
I think this made me more determined to try and change the rules so we can continue with everest as usual but in a safer way.
I've been a mountain guide all my life.
We have to deal with death a lot, and then try and move on.
Hopefully, we will have a team to go to climb mount everest again next year.
¶¶
the game shifted.
It would be easy in the chaos of this last week to lose sight of what has happened here.
The sherpas have effectively canceled the season.
They had a choice, and in the end, they've chosen respect for themselves and the mountain ahead of money.
Canceling the season will be a welcomed breathing space.
So maybe it will be calmer.
It will be nice for everest to be calm for a bit rather than this kind of madness.
My father said that you don't conquer these mountains, you know?
You just crawl up, as a child crawling to your mother's lap, which is the same approach i think people should take.
Then there'd be less accidents.
He was the first asian become famous, known around the world, and he became a great metaphor for young men all alike to show that you can make it on your own, hard work is what it takes.
And so he became a real symbol of hope for millions around the world.
¶¶
¶¶
tenzing gave the name sherpa a currency which will never be exhausted.
So it may only be now that they're really beginning to take advantage of it.
They've got control of climbing the mountain, and it's come full circle in a way.
My father said he climbed so that we wouldn't have to.
He wanted to give us the best education so we could continue our lives in some other careers rather than climbing.

Douglas:
This is an astonishingly chance relationship.
Between western climbers and the sherpas.
When climbing began, the sherpas had no conception of what mountaineering might be, and yet, suddenly they were on this journey from being people who just genetically were really good at altitude to becoming, you know, international mountain guides 100 years later.
Man: 1953... coronation year.
The world was turned by the news that Everest had at last been conquered by a British expedition led by colonel John hunt.
Accompanied by the famous sherpa tenzing,
Edmund Hillary climbed the summit of the world's highest mountain.
Douglas:
When tenzing norgay reached the summit of Everest, that is such an amazing moment.
It's one of the most beautiful moments in climbing history.
That's the moment when the word "sherpa"
has the meaning of brand in the way that we understand it.
The world was captivated by tenzing.
And he fixed in our minds the popular image of a sherpa, as this smiling, friendly, almost heroic figure.
Jamling:
A lot of the western world.
Do not know what a sherpa is.
So, a sherpa, you know...
You climb mountains, you know?
And that's the first instinct, but they have no idea that we are actually an ethnic group of people.
We believe in reincarnation...
Life after death.
And you continue to be reborn and reborn and reborn until the day you reach nirvana.
So, your next life is determined by your deeds of this life.
We sherpa people have a great respect for the mountain.
Norgay:
Over here, we climb mountains, but it's a holy place.
There's a huge difference in, you know, the attitude, the feeling.
Western people approach it as a physical challenge...
Push your limit to see how close you can get to death.
But there's 1,000-year-old stories we have about the mountain's history, which these people have no idea about.
And I think some people adapt and learn and respect it.
Some people don't.
Douglas:
If phurba is one of the most successful climbing sherpas.
Of his generation, then his counterpart amongst expedition leaders is his boss, Russell Brice.
Brice:
I've been running commercial expeditions here.
Since 1994.
I think I'm the person that's been on more Everest expeditions than anyone else in the world.
- It's all oxygen.
- All oxygen.
And I brought those two broken ones in kathmandu.

Part of the reason why you want to come and climb...
You want to experience those things, see if you can do it, see if you can physically do it.
It's a massive undertaking.
The training is phenomenal.
And, you know, it's not something you put together in a couple weeks.
It's months of planning and months of getting organized.
Everest has always been attractive for several reasons for me.
I love the Buddhist side to it.

Because the potential is there.
Douglas:
And the question is...
What is the moral justification for that?
You know, what reward is there for you to play what is essentially a game of Russian roulette?
In 2012, I determined the mountain to be dangerous.
[ Indistinct radio chatter ]
Every night, I'd listen to the sherpas on the radio going through the icefall.
And all the time, they were running away from small avalanches and blocks of ice falling down and things like that.
So I made a decision to cancel my expedition.
That's an incredibly hard thing to do...
To cancel a commercial expedition.
Douglas:
There were people around who said,
"well, Russell's, you know, being a bit of a chump here"
because his clients will be pissed off because they went home
"and other people got to the top."
I think Russell Brice was really putting into perspective the risks that people were making the sherpas take.
Now Russell has four of those clients returning this year.
So that adds a lot of pressure for a successful expedition.
Douglas:
Tenzing norgay was a man.
Who was determined to change his stars.
And when he reached the summit of Everest, he did that.
The British couldn't have done it with someone like tenzing.
He'd been to the mountain seven times by that point, and they benefited from all those years of his experience, but he wasn't acknowledged.
He wasn't given due regard for what he had achieved.
Coming down from that, almost immediately, he finds himself in a political firestorm.
Reporter:
Who got to the top first?
Hunt:
To anybody who climbs mountains, to any mountaineer, and I feel to thousands of others.
The matter couldn't matter less.
Reporter #2:
When tenzing norgay was asked how he felt, his chilly answers had to be interpreted.
Hunt:
He's very happy.
[ Laughter ]
Reporter #2:
All this and the George medal, too.
Douglas:
So John hunt became sir John hunt,
Hillary became sir ed Hillary, and tenzing got the George medal.
Now, there is a superior award to that... the George cross.
So it's kind of like a second-level award.
It was just not right.
So in the eyes of sherpas, in the eyes of people in India, in the eyes of most asians, they felt somewhat slighted that he would not get the same kind of recognition that his partners got.
Jamling:
My father said,
"i wish I had never climbed this mountain."
Douglas:
He was immensely proud of what he had achieved, but I think he felt thwarted in a way.
I think he felt that he hadn't realized himself in the way that he would have liked.
I think partly it's because, you know, he lacked a formal education.
Steven:
The 60-year-old reputation.
Of what it is to be a sherpa is changing.
Joshi:
Now, you go to base camp.
And more than 80% of sherpas finish their high school.
And if you go 20 years ago, none of them have been to high school.
Because of their education, they know a lot more than western clients think they do.
Steven:
Now with the Facebook generation, sherpas see how much credit westerners are getting for a climb on Everest, and they know that they've done most of the grunt work.
Without the sherpa, the westerner would never have gotten there.
And they are dissatisfied with that.
And they want equal credit for what they have done.
What we've seen in recent years is a...
A tendency of aggression from younger sherpas.
So, last year, there was fighting on Everest, and I think we were all disappointed, so sad about that.

Douglas:
The reason Everest takes eight weeks to climb.
Is that the body needs to slowly acclimatize to the altitude.
Brice:
We do our acclimatization on lobuche peak.
To stay out of the icefall, to reduce the risk for our clients.
Douglas:
And so when, you know, Russell Brice.
Starts getting his clients to camp on top of, you know, a nearby peak rather than going through the icefall to acclimatize, you know, that makes sense.
The fewer trips anyone has to make through the icefall, the better.
Meanwhile, the sherpas are still stocking the camps on Everest, making dozens of trips up and down, carrying all the oxygen, the tents, the food, so on.
So that the mountain is ready to be climbed when the clients return.
Brice:
This year, my clients will go through the icefall twice, but I dare say most of the sherpas will go through maybe 20 to 30 times.
And I'm not sure the clients actually ever see that.

Safety is very, very important.
If you go through the icefall without crampons, if you go through the icefall without clipping on,
I'm gonna sack you.
You're gonna go home.
Douglas:
It must seem crazy going through the khumbu icefall.
In the dark, but it's actually much safer because it's more stable in the cold of night.
Once the sun hits, it becomes increasingly dangerous.
Brice:
You have to remember.
That you have a big responsibility not only for your own safety but for your family.
Even if it's a full moon, you must have your headlamp.
The transceivers must be turned on here, and you must use the transceiver every day that you go through the icefall.
We know if a serac falls on top of you you're not going to survive, but if you have a transceiver, it means to find you will take much less time.
And so that puts the people doing the rescue at much less risk.

The government...
You know, once it figured out that it could sell Everest as many times as it liked every year rather than once, it's basically just sat there, occasionally twiddled around the edges when there was some bad headlines,
but basically not really done anything since.
They've left it to western, you know, operators and just taken their cut every year, and it's a big cut.
It's like 1/3 of the money that stays in Nepal from this business goes to the government.
The sherpas...
They're still taking the risks.

This is unprecedented that the sherpas.

One of the biggest requests from the workers in this base camp is to not continue climbing this year.
We know that's a great big ask, but it's somewhat small compared to the 16 lives we've lost in this mountain.
This is not workable for us.
We've still got our sherpas to come to talk to, to see if we want to carry on climbing or not.
We can't have this happening every time there's an accident every season.

I'll tack the top of that mountain at some point, so... just a slight setback.
I'm gonna feel better when I go home knowing that we didn't climb up that mountain after the big tragedy.
It's just better to show my respect for the sherpa community by leaving.
Joshi:
I think the expedition organizers...
They knew in their heart what their sherpa wants, but they couldn't tell that clearly to their clients.
It's just the excuses they are using to throw the blame on somebody else, yeah.

If this didn't change anything, then nothing ever will.
Then Nepal will just be like the wild, wild west for the western operators to do whatever they want.
This thing has happened, which is a sad thing, but hopefully, this will bring something positive into the mountain.
Brice:
It must have some effect of the Everest industry...
The accident this year.
I think this made me more determined to try and change the rules so we can continue with Everest as usual but in a safer way.
I've been a mountain guide all my life.
We have to deal with death a lot, and then try and move on.
Hopefully, we will have a team to go to climb mount Everest again next year.

Douglas:
The game shifted.
It would be easy in the chaos of this last week to lose sight of what has happened here.
The sherpas have effectively canceled the season.
They had a choice, and in the end, they've chosen respect for themselves and the mountain ahead of money.
Canceling the season will be a welcomed breathing space.
So maybe it will be calmer.
It will be nice for Everest to be calm for a bit rather than this kind of madness.
My father said that you don't conquer these mountains, you know?
You just crawl up, as a child crawling to your mother's lap, which is the same approach i think people should take.
Then there'd be less accidents.
Norbu:
He was the first Asian to become famous, known around the world, and he became a great metaphor for young men all alike to show that you can make it on your own, hard work is what it takes.
And so he became a real symbol of hope for millions around the world.

Douglas:
Tenzing gave the name sherpa a currency.
Which will never be exhausted.
So it may only be now that they're really beginning to take advantage of it.
They've got control of climbing the mountain, and it's come full circle in a way.
[ Laughter ]
Jamling:
My father said he climbed.
So that we wouldn't have to.
He wanted to give us the best education so we could continue our lives in some other careers rather than climbing.
Because climbing was dangerous.

All right, gang, we'll buzz past the Scauldron and draw its attention so Astrid, Ruff and Tuff can net it from behind and drag it out to sea, got it?
I still think we should blast it!
Stoick just wants us to move the Scauldron out of Berk's fishing lanes, so don't get any crazy ideas.
Uh, sorry.
Crazy is what we do, Astrid.
Duh!
You guys do realize that a Scauldron's hot water blast can rip the scales right off a Screaming Death?
[roaring]
There it is.
Let's focus, guys.
As usual, nobody's listening to Fishlegs. [snorts]
One...
[snorts]
Two...
[grunting]
- Three!
- Ah-choo!
Aah!
Aaah!
Help me!
Abort!
Abort!
Aah!
Fishlegs!
Uhh!
I knew I hated this mission.
[roaring]
Plasma blast, bud.
[roars]
Oh, I see how it is.
You're allowed to blast it.
You and your Snot-rockets almost got me killed!
Calm down, Snotlout, you lived.
Yay us.
No thanks to Itch-legs over here.
It's so weird.
I mean, I never...
oh... ever...
Ah-choo!
[groans] ...get sick.
[scratching] Ohh.
- Oh, gosh.
- Dig deeper, see if you can draw blood.
Well, something's clearly not right with you.
[grunts]
I don't see what the big deal is, okay?
Everybody sneezes and scratches sometimes.
Not like a honey-covered yak on an anthill.
What?
You've never seen a honey-covered yak on an anthill?
Well, those things scratch.
It's terrifying.
The horrors haunt my dreams.
I really don't feel sick, okay?
I promise, I'm fine.
[grunting]
Ugh.
Well, maybe you're just allergic to something.
Uh, that's impossible.
Allergies don't run in the Ingerman family.
- I'm clean, serene and...
- And an itchin' machine!
Might I interject?
We at the Thorston house have a very simple allergen detection system.
It has never failed.
- That's a system?
- It is now.
Thousand-year-old egg.
Slam this down your gullet.
Hmm.
[crunches, gulps]
Oh, it could use a little sea salt.
- Ahh.
- What about this?
- Aah!
- Yak hair.
Takes itchy to a whole new level.
Not really.
Feels kind of like my old Aunt Gerta.
- You know, she used to...
- No, I'd like to be able to sleep tonight.
Spoiled, coagulated goat milk with just a pinch of hoof jam.
I find it changes the whole experience.
Hmm.
[gulping]
Oh, that is... cheesy and delicious!
[all] Ugh!
I'm telling you, I've never been allergic to anything.
Ah-choo!
- Huh.
- What?
What is it?
Fishlegs?
I think you might be allergic to...
Meatlug.
[Meatlug growls]
Why, all of a sudden, would he be allergic to Meatlug?
Perhaps it's just a simple case of adult-onset allergies.
Ah, I concur with your diagnosis, Dr. Nut.
I concur with your concur-ation.
Adult-onset allergies develop in your elder years when your immune system mistakenly identifies a dangerous substance.
Don't be silly.
There's no way I'm... [snorts] ...allergic to Meat...
[Fishlegs sneezing hysterically]
Oh, yeah, diagnosis confirmed.
Fishlegs, there's only one person that might actually be able to help.
[chuckles] Ohh, I gotta see this.
What's she saying?
- Huh.
- What?
What?
!
- She wants to paralyze you.
- [gasps] Yes!
Aah!
Check that.
Hypnotize.
- Sorry, she wants to hypnotize you.
- Uhh, come on.
[chuckles] Unfortunately, guys, this is never gonna work on me because I'm way too...
Okay. [snoring]
Unconscious?
Ha!
Quick, put his hands in warm water.
We're not going to do that.
Okay, now that he's under, she wants us to tell him that he's not allergic to Meatlug.
- Does that really work?
- I guess we'll find out.
[snoring] Here goes.
Fishlegs, you are not allergic to Meatlug.
[echoing] You are not allergic to Meatlug.
[groans]
- So, that's it?
- Hypnosis is very powerful.
- Okay, let's bring him out of it.
- Now, now, now, hang on a second.
We've got an opportunity here.
We can rebuild Fish-face.
We can turn him into a worshiped Viking, a fearless godlike hero...
[grunting] ...as strong as three yaks!
A Viking who commands attention!
In other words, a Viking worthy of my friendship.
Uh, yeah, sorry, Snotlout, we're not doing any of that.
You can bring him out of it now.
[snaps fingers]
[joints cracking]
Fishlegs?
[haughty accent] Fishlegs?
There's no Fishlegs here.
Who is this pudgy little reptile?
[Gobber] That was a bit harsh.
- Fishlegs, are you all right?
- Are you deaf, skinny, one-legged boy?
The name's Bonecrusher.
Aah!
Thor Bonecrusher.
Snotlout, do you realize what you've done?
You fool, you've created...
My very own super-Viking...
Thor Flipping Bonecrusher!
I love it!
[bleats] [indistinct chatter]
Oh, hello.
[woman] Ah.
[gasps]
[Astrid] And Gothi can't just turn him back?
Not without her staff, which Thor Bonecrusher crushed and threw off the cliff.
- Is that Fishlegs?
- [mumbles] I don't know.
So, TB, you're not afraid of anything, huh?
- Aha!
- Mmm!
- Oh.
- Ha!

- How about fire?
- I scoff at fire!

But you're Fishlegs...

- Nonsense, crone!
- Oh!

He ran, and then did a flip and then a toss and then a thing, and then flipped into the other thing.
Ohh!

Is it me, or did Snotlout just fall in love with Fishlegs?

- [all] Ooh.
- Sleep well, little yak.
[applause] Sleep well.
What's next, Thor?

[laughs] [chuckles] I shall, citizen, I shall.
But first, I must claim a weapon befitting a god!
[laughs] Thor, you have got to teach me that Viking yak pinch.
[crack] Aah!
Ow!
All in the wrist, Snot-man.
[Gobber] # Well, I got my axe and I got my mace... #
You, simple blacksmith!
- "Simple blacksmith?"
- Uh, how about this one?
Oh, that's perfect...
for removing splinters.
[laughs] What about this one?
You can use it to annihilate your enemies.
That's a nice handle, I suppose... if I had wee lady hands.
[laughs]
Huh.
I made that handle with my best leather.
Ahh!
- Hmm.
- Eh?
No, this.
This is an axe for a Viking.
- Aah!
- That's Stoick's axe.
Correction:
This was Stoick's axe.
Uh, okay, uh, Fishlegs?
[stammering] I-I mean, Bonecrusher.
Stoick isn't exactly the kind of chief who likes to share his things,
- especially his axe.
- Neither do I.
If this Stoick fellow wants it, he can always try and take it back from me.
Oh, man!
He just totally called out Stoick!
How much do we love this guy?
[groans]
Okay, this is getting out of hand.
We need to get Thor Bonecrusher back to Gothi before we lose Fishlegs forever.
I totally agree.
Just one question.
Where'd he go?
So there I was, Thor Bonecrusher, perched on an inferior dragon as we approached the vicious Scauldron, faster than Odin on his eight-legged horse.
You could have Hookfang next time.
He's a Monstrous Nightmare, scariest dragon of all.
Monstrous Nightmare?
Sounds like my post-mutton trip to the outhouse.
[laughing] Post-mutton trip!
We've all been there, aint we?
!
[laughter] [laughs nervously]
Good one.
[snarls]
Poor Meatlug.
Wouldn't even wear her saddle.
Look at her.
So lonely.
- We've got to do something with her.
- I'll take care of Meatlug.
My chances of survival were slim.
I only had one option.
Ah, ooh, oh, oh!
Fly away?
- I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
- Sorry.
No, I had something very special in store for that Scauldron.
[snarls] [roaring] Engage the beast, dragon!
[whimpering]
Aah!
Aah!
[all gasp]
He narrowly escaped.
However, next time, victory shall be mine!
[all cheering]
Put me in your next story!
Just as the background.
But please?
- Fishlegs!
Is that my axe?
!
- [stammers] O-oh, he's got his axe.
[muttering]
- Uh, Dad, that's not Fishlegs Fishlegs.
- Don't be daft.
I'm looking right at him, holding my axe, by the way.
Ah, you must be Stoick the Vast ly overrated.
What did you call me?
What did he call me?
!
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
He's not himself.
- Give me back my axe!
- Don't you mean my axe?
[snarls] [cracks knuckles]
He was just polishing it for you, Chief.
Let me handle this.
I will get your axe back to you, I promise.
Fine, but make it quick, or I'll take it from him myself.
Chief, let's get out of here.
How about a nice piece of mutton?
[Fishlegs] I hope this won't take long, sorceress.
I like to nap after a feast of wild boar and mead.
Thanks, Gothi, we really need Fishlegs back.
[grunting] [grunting]
[vomits]
Ugh!
What was in that potion?
It wasn't a potion.
Just spiced yak bladder.
She says that'll teach him to break her staff.
[grunting, panting]
- Not the most delicate delicacy.
- What about getting Fishlegs back?
She can't re-hypnotize him without her staff.
Great, now what?
Fear.
Only a true feeling of terror will shock Fishlegs back to normal.
But Mr. Thor Bonecrusher over here isn't afraid of anything.
Truer words were never spoken, my fair Viking lady.
- Ugh.
- Now, where is that snotty fellow?
We have business to discuss.
Hiccup, you may want to swing by the old homestead.
Your father is in a bit of a... state.
[Stoick] Get this dragon off me!
[grunting]
Dad, she's just lonely.
If she doesn't get off me, we'll be having Gronckle for breakfast.
We need to get Fishlegs back before this gets any worse.
- Hiccup!
- Let me guess.
It's Thor.
Yeah, and Snotlout.
And you're not gonna believe where they're headed.
Ohh!
Can't this overgrown lizard fly any faster?
[laughs] Come on, Hookfang, you're embarrassing me.
[snorts]
Onward, Snot-man.
We must find a dragon worthy of my command.
My destiny awaits!
[Snotlout laughs nervously] [man] Bonecrusher is going after the Scauldron!
Bonecrusher is going after the Scauldron!
Oh, he's going to tame the Scauldron!
He's gonna get killed by the Scauldron.
They have to be down there somewhere.
- What was Snotlout thinking?
- He wasn't.
He's in love.
[baby talk] He'd do anything for his big hunk of bone-crushing love.
Well, we'd better find them before they find the Scauldron.
Just think, Snotlout, at any moment, the giant beast will emerge from the water and I will tame him.
Or he'll kill you.
Ha!
You're funny, TB.
[laughs]
Listen, let me throw something out there.
What if we...
I don't know...
head back, call it a day, relax at the Great Hall, tell some more really cool stories.
You know, I've heard that a Scauldron's hot water blast can rip the scales off of a Screaming Death.
What gutless fool told you that?
- Ohh!
- Nonsense.
Thor Bonecrusher cannot return to Berk dragon-less.
Negative, Snot-man.
I am not leaving these waters without my prize.
[roaring]
Aha!
Time to engage my quarry.
Dive, dragon, dive!
[Snotlout screaming]
Aah!

Fire!
Okay, that ought to do it, right, TB?
[Snotlout screams]
Uhh!

Uhh!
Easy, now, big fella.
Ohh!
Aah!

Snotlout's in the water!
You guys grab him.
I'll go after Fishlegs.
Okay.
Stormfly, let's go.
[laughs] Ah!
This is what I live for!
[laughter]
Whoa!
[Astrid] Keep looking, he must be here somewhere.
So, how hard do you think we really need to look?
I'm thinking some passing glances might do the trick.
Well, the sooner we rescue Snotlout, the sooner we can watch Fishlegs get eaten by the Scauldron.
Well, if you put it that way, let's go!
It would be so much easier if you'd just submit to your new master.
[bubbling screams]
[Fishlegs] Got you where I want you.
[Hiccup exclaiming]
Hookfang!
Oh, can this possibly get any worse?
[roaring]
Worse!
Way worse!
Aah!
Whoa!
Hey.
[growls]
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I will never try to give you away ever again!
What the...
- Whoa!
- [Hiccup] Toothless, watch out!
Come on, jump over!
Retreat?
In my moment of glory?
Never!
Whoa!
[roaring]
Aah!

No, Meatlug!

Stop, dragon.
I, Thor Bonecrusher, command you to stop.

Not my Meatlug!
You leave my dragon alone!
No!

He's a Monstrous Nightmare, scariest dragon of all.
Monstrous Nightmare?
Sounds like my post-mutton trip to the outhouse.
Post-mutton trip!
We've all been there, aint we?
!
Good one.
Poor Meatlug.
Wouldn't even wear her saddle.
Look at her.
So lonely.
- We've got to do something with her.
- I'll take care of Meatlug.
My chances of survival were slim.
I only had one option.
Ah, ooh, oh, oh!
Fly away?
- I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
- Sorry.
No, I had something very special in store for that Scauldron.
Engage the beast, dragon!
Aah!
Aah!
He narrowly escaped.
However, next time, victory shall be mine!
Put me in your next story!
Just as the background.
But please?
- Fishlegs!
Is that my axe?
!
- O-oh, he's got his axe.
- Uh, Dad, that's not Fishlegs Fishlegs.
- Don't be daft.
I'm looking right at him, holding my axe, by the way.
Ah, you must be Stoick the Vast ly overrated.
What did you call me?
What did he call me?
!
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
He's not himself.
- Give me back my axe!
- Don't you mean my axe?
He was just polishing it for you, Chief.
Let me handle this.
I will get your axe back to you, I promise.
Fine, but make it quick, or I'll take it from him myself.
Chief, let's get out of here.
How about a nice piece of mutton?
I hope this won't take long, sorceress.
I like to nap after a feast of wild boar and mead.
Thanks, Gothi, we really need Fishlegs back.
Ugh!
What was in that potion?
It wasn't a potion.
Just spiced yak bladder.
She says that'll teach him to break her staff.
- Not the most delicate delicacy.
- What about getting Fishlegs back?
She can't re-hypnotize him without her staff.
Great, now what?
Fear.
Only a true feeling of terror will shock Fishlegs back to normal.
But Mr. Thor Bonecrusher over here isn't afraid of anything.
Truer words were never spoken, my fair Viking lady.
- Ugh.
- Now, where is that snotty fellow?
We have business to discuss.
Hiccup, you may want to swing by the old homestead.
Your father is in a bit of a... state.
Get this dragon off me!
Dad, she's just lonely.
If she doesn't get off me, we'll be having Gronckle for breakfast.
We need to get Fishlegs back before this gets any worse.
- Hiccup!
- Let me guess.
It's Thor.
Yeah, and Snotlout.
And you're not gonna believe where they're headed.
Ohh!
Can't this overgrown lizard fly any faster?
Come on, Hookfang, you're embarrassing me.
Onward, Snot-man.
We must find a dragon worthy of my command.
My destiny awaits!
Bonecrusher is going after the Scauldron!
Bonecrusher is going after the Scauldron!
Oh, he's going to tame the Scauldron!
He's gonna get killed by the Scauldron.
They have to be down there somewhere.
- What was Snotlout thinking?
- He wasn't.
He's in love.
He'd do anything for his big hunk of bone-crushing love.
Well, we'd better find them before they find the Scauldron.
Just think, Snotlout, at any moment, the giant beast will emerge from the water and I will tame him.
Or he'll kill you.
Ha!
You're funny, TB.
Listen, let me throw something out there.
What if we...
I don't know...
head back, call it a day, relax at the Great Hall, tell some more really cool stories.
You know, I've heard that a Scauldron's hot water blast can rip the scales off of a Screaming Death.
What gutless fool told you that?
- Ohh!
- Nonsense.
Thor Bonecrusher cannot return to Berk dragon-less.
Negative, Snot-man.
I am not leaving these waters without my prize.
Aha!
Time to engage my quarry.
Dive, dragon, dive!
Aah!
My super-Viking's gone rogue!
Fire!
Okay, that ought to do it, right, TB?
Uhh!
Dance, big boy.
There they are!
Come on!
Uhh!
Easy, now, big fella.
Ohh!
Aah!
Help... me!
Snotlout's in the water!
You guys grab him.
I'll go after Fishlegs.
Okay.
Stormfly, let's go.
Ah!
This is what I live for!
Whoa!
Keep looking, he must be here somewhere.
So, how hard do you think we really need to look?
I'm thinking some passing glances might do the trick.
Well, the sooner we rescue Snotlout, the sooner we can watch Fishlegs get eaten by the Scauldron.
Well, if you put it that way, let's go!
It would be so much easier if you'd just submit to your new master.
Got you where I want you.
Hookfang!
Oh, can this possibly get any worse?
Worse!
Way worse!
Aah!
Whoa!
Hey.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I will never try to give you away ever again!
What the...
- Whoa!
- Toothless, watch out!
Come on, jump over!
Retreat?
In my moment of glory?
Never!
Whoa!
Aah!
Yes, Meatlug!
No, Meatlug!
Stop, dragon.
I, Thor Bonecrusher, command you to stop.
Raaah!
No!
No!
Not my Meatlug!
You leave my dragon alone!
No!
That was a little too close.
Speak for yourself.
That was freakin' awesome!
Oh, I'm so sorry, girl.
I don't know what happened to me.
I just...
I wasn't myself.
Oh, I missed you!
Oh!
- How did I...
- Long story.
I'll explain later.
♪ Hooligan tribe Won't you come out tonight?
♪
♪ Come out tonight Come out tonight... ♪
So, what happened to the Scauldron?
He's been relocated.
- And my axe?
- Uh...
Also relocated.
But what of Thor Bonecrusher?
- Yeah, Bonecrusher!
- I miss him!
Whoo!
- Hello.
- No.
You know, Fishlegs, you didn't sneeze once the whole ride home.
Yeah.
And my legs don't itch anymore.
And Meatlug isn't wearing her saddle.
Maybe you were never allergic to her, you were allergic to the saddle!
But why, all of a sudden, would I become allergic to her saddle?
Well, uh, I've been using a different kind of wax on the saddles.
Look at that.
Ugh.
- Oh, great.
- What?
I never run out of the stuff.
It's coming out of my ears.
Well... ah-choo!
- I'm allergic to Gobber's earwax?
- Ohh.
Ha!
I am both relieved and disgusted.
What?
What is it?
I'm just thinking of what might have been.
You broke my heart, Thor.
You broke it right in two.
- Okay, that was creepy, right?
- You don't know the half of it.
Oh, I miss you, Thor.
[Hiccup] This changes everything.
_
All right, gang, we'll buzz past the Scauldron and draw its attention so Astrid, Ruff and Tuff can net it from behind and drag it out to sea, got it?
I still think we should blast it!
Stoick just wants us to move the Scauldron out of Berk's fishing lanes, so don't get any crazy ideas.
Uh, sorry.
Crazy is what we do, Astrid.
Duh!
You guys do realize that a Scauldron's hot water blast can rip the scales right off a Screaming Death?
[roaring]
There it is.
Let's focus, guys.
As usual, nobody's listening to Fishlegs. [snorts]
One...
[snorts]
Two...
[grunting]
- Three!
- Ah-choo!
Aah!
Aaah!
Help me!
Abort!
Abort!
Aah!
Fishlegs!
Uhh!
I knew I hated this mission.
[roaring]
Plasma blast, bud.
[roars]
Oh, I see how it is.
You're allowed to blast it.
You and your Snot-rockets almost got me killed!
Calm down, Snotlout, you lived.
Yay us.
No thanks to Itch-legs over here.
It's so weird.
I mean, I never...
oh... ever...
Ah-choo!
[groans] ...get sick.
[scratching] Ohh.
- Oh, gosh.
- Dig deeper, see if you can draw blood.
Well, something's clearly not right with you.
[grunts]
I don't see what the big deal is, okay?
Everybody sneezes and scratches sometimes.
Not like a honey-covered yak on an anthill.
What?
You've never seen a honey-covered yak on an anthill?
Well, those things scratch.
It's terrifying.
The horrors haunt my dreams.
I really don't feel sick, okay?
I promise, I'm fine.
[grunting]
Ugh.
Well, maybe you're just allergic to something.
Uh, that's impossible.
Allergies don't run in the Ingerman family.
- I'm clean, serene and...
- And an itchin' machine!
Might I interject?
We at the Thorston house have a very simple allergen detection system.
It has never failed.
- That's a system?
- It is now.
Thousand-year-old egg.
Slam this down your gullet.
Hmm.
[crunches, gulps]
Oh, it could use a little sea salt.
- Ahh.
- What about this?
- Aah!
- Yak hair.
Takes itchy to a whole new level.
Not really.
Feels kind of like my old Aunt Gerta.
- You know, she used to...
- No, I'd like to be able to sleep tonight.
Spoiled, coagulated goat milk with just a pinch of hoof jam.
I find it changes the whole experience.
Hmm.
[gulping]
Oh, that is... cheesy and delicious!
[all] Ugh!
I'm telling you, I've never been allergic to anything.
Ah-choo!
- Huh.
- What?
What is it?
Fishlegs?
I think you might be allergic to...
Meatlug.
[Meatlug growls]
Why, all of a sudden, would he be allergic to Meatlug?
Perhaps it's just a simple case of adult-onset allergies.
Ah, I concur with your diagnosis, Dr. Nut.
I concur with your concur-ation.
Adult-onset allergies develop in your elder years when your immune system mistakenly identifies a dangerous substance.
Don't be silly.
There's no way I'm... [snorts] ...allergic to Meat...
[Fishlegs sneezing hysterically]
Oh, yeah, diagnosis confirmed.
Fishlegs, there's only one person that might actually be able to help.
[chuckles] Ohh, I gotta see this.
What's she saying?
- Huh.
- What?
What?
!
- She wants to paralyze you.
- [gasps] Yes!
Aah!
Check that.
Hypnotize.
- Sorry, she wants to hypnotize you.
- Uhh, come on.
[chuckles] Unfortunately, guys, this is never gonna work on me because I'm way too...
Okay. [snoring]
Unconscious?
Ha!
Quick, put his hands in warm water.
We're not going to do that.
Okay, now that he's under, she wants us to tell him that he's not allergic to Meatlug.
- Does that really work?
- I guess we'll find out.
[snoring] Here goes.
Fishlegs, you are not allergic to Meatlug.
[echoing] You are not allergic to Meatlug.
[groans]
- So, that's it?
- Hypnosis is very powerful.
- Okay, let's bring him out of it.
- Now, now, now, hang on a second.
We've got an opportunity here.
We can rebuild Fish-face.
We can turn him into a worshiped Viking, a fearless godlike hero...
[grunting] ...as strong as three yaks!
A Viking who commands attention!
In other words, a Viking worthy of my friendship.
Uh, yeah, sorry, Snotlout, we're not doing any of that.
You can bring him out of it now.
[snaps fingers]
[joints cracking]
Fishlegs?
[haughty accent] Fishlegs?
There's no Fishlegs here.
Who is this pudgy little reptile?
[Gobber] That was a bit harsh.
- Fishlegs, are you all right?
- Are you deaf, skinny, one-legged boy?
The name's Bonecrusher.
Aah!
Thor Bonecrusher.
Snotlout, do you realize what you've done?
You fool, you've created...
My very own super-Viking...
Thor Flipping Bonecrusher!
I love it!
[bleats] [indistinct chatter]
Oh, hello.
[woman] Ah.
[gasps]
[Astrid] And Gothi can't just turn him back?
Not without her staff, which Thor Bonecrusher crushed and threw off the cliff.
- Is that Fishlegs?
- [mumbles] I don't know.
So, TB, you're not afraid of anything, huh?
- Aha!
- Mmm!
- Oh.
- Ha!
Child's play.
- How about fire?
- I scoff at fire!
[woman] Fire!
My house is on fire!
Someone threw a torch on my house!
Perfect, a call to action!
[sheep bleating] [people cheering]
Please hold your applause until the end of the rescue.
You may commence.
[all cheering]
- Fishlegs...
- Fishlegs?
Why does everybody keep calling me Fishlegs?
But you're Fishlegs...
Fishlegs.
- Nonsense, crone!
- Oh!
Uhh!
People of Berk... [both] Huh?
It is with great pleasure that I announce the arrival of me,
Thor Bonecrusher.
The most universally feared and loved Viking in all the land is here to enchant you with my presence.
Oh!
Look out, the cart!
[baby crying] [gasps] [laughs]
- Ohh!
- What?
Ah!
The baby!
[grunting]
[baby cries] [all gasp] [baby giggles]
Huh?
Yeah!
Apple-boot!
All in a days' work.
[baby] Thor...
Did you see that?
!
That was incredible!
He ran, and then did a flip and then a toss and then a thing, and then flipped into the other thing.
Ohh!
He's amazing.
Is it me, or did Snotlout just fall in love with Fishlegs?
Bonecrusher!
Bonecrusher!
Bonecrusher!
[all chanting] Bonecrusher!
Bonecrusher!
[animal groaning] Shh, everyone!
Thor hears the sound of a baby yak in trouble.
[grunting]
[growls] Hyah!
[crack] [groans]
- [all] Ooh.
- Sleep well, little yak.
[applause] Sleep well.
What's next, Thor?
Show us more amazing feats of bravery!
[laughs] [chuckles] I shall, citizen, I shall.
But first, I must claim a weapon befitting a god!
[laughs] Thor, you have got to teach me that Viking yak pinch.
[crack] Aah!
Ow!
All in the wrist, Snot-man.
[Gobber] # Well, I got my axe and I got my mace... #
You, simple blacksmith!
- "Simple blacksmith?"
- Uh, how about this one?
Oh, that's perfect...
for removing splinters.
[laughs] What about this one?
You can use it to annihilate your enemies.
That's a nice handle, I suppose... if I had wee lady hands.
[laughs]
Huh.
I made that handle with my best leather.
Ahh!
- Hmm.
- Eh?
No, this.
This is an axe for a Viking.
- Aah!
- That's Stoick's axe.
Correction:
This was Stoick's axe.
Uh, okay, uh, Fishlegs?
[stammering] I-I mean, Bonecrusher.
Stoick isn't exactly the kind of chief who likes to share his things,
- especially his axe.
- Neither do I.
If this Stoick fellow wants it, he can always try and take it back from me.
Oh, man!
He just totally called out Stoick!
How much do we love this guy?
[groans]
Okay, this is getting out of hand.
We need to get Thor Bonecrusher back to Gothi before we lose Fishlegs forever.
I totally agree.
Just one question.
Where'd he go?
So there I was, Thor Bonecrusher, perched on an inferior dragon as we approached the vicious Scauldron, faster than Odin on his eight-legged horse.
You could have Hookfang next time.
He's a Monstrous Nightmare, scariest dragon of all.
Monstrous Nightmare?
Sounds like my post-mutton trip to the outhouse.
[laughing] Post-mutton trip!
We've all been there, aint we?
!
[laughter] [laughs nervously]
Good one.
[snarls]
Poor Meatlug.
Wouldn't even wear her saddle.
Look at her.
So lonely.
- We've got to do something with her.
- I'll take care of Meatlug.
My chances of survival were slim.
I only had one option.
Ah, ooh, oh, oh!
Fly away?
- I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
- Sorry.
No, I had something very special in store for that Scauldron.
[snarls] [roaring] Engage the beast, dragon!
[whimpering]
Aah!
Aah!
[all gasp]
He narrowly escaped.
However, next time, victory shall be mine!
[all cheering]
Put me in your next story!
Just as the background.
But please?
- Fishlegs!
Is that my axe?
!
- [stammers] O-oh, he's got his axe.
[muttering]
- Uh, Dad, that's not Fishlegs Fishlegs.
- Don't be daft.
I'm looking right at him, holding my axe, by the way.
Ah, you must be Stoick the Vast ly overrated.
What did you call me?
What did he call me?
!
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
He's not himself.
- Give me back my axe!
- Don't you mean my axe?
[snarls] [cracks knuckles]
He was just polishing it for you, Chief.
Let me handle this.
I will get your axe back to you, I promise.
Fine, but make it quick, or I'll take it from him myself.
Chief, let's get out of here.
How about a nice piece of mutton?
[Fishlegs] I hope this won't take long, sorceress.
I like to nap after a feast of wild boar and mead.
Thanks, Gothi, we really need Fishlegs back.
[grunting] [grunting]

Ugh!

If she doesn't get off me, we'll be having Gronckle for breakfast.
We need to get Fishlegs back before this gets any worse.
- Hiccup!

It's Thor.
Yeah, and Snotlout.
And you're not gonna believe where they're headed.
Ohh!

[laughs] Come on, Hookfang, you're embarrassing me.
[snorts]

We must find a dragon worthy of my command.
My destiny awaits!
[Snotlout laughs nervously] [man] Bonecrusher is going after the Scauldron!
Bonecrusher is going after the Scauldron!
Oh, he's going to tame the Scauldron!
He's gonna get killed by the Scauldron.
They have to be down there somewhere.

I am not leaving these waters without my prize.
[roaring]
Aha!
Time to engage my quarry.
Dive, dragon, dive!
[Snotlout screaming]
Aah!
My super-Viking's gone rogue!
Fire!
Okay, that ought to do it, right, TB?
[Snotlout screams]
Uhh!
Dance, big boy.
There they are!
Come on!
[chuckles]
Uhh!
Easy, now, big fella.
Ohh!
Aah!
Help... me!
[screaming]
Snotlout's in the water!
You guys grab him.
I'll go after Fishlegs.
Okay.
Stormfly, let's go.
[laughs] Ah!
This is what I live for!
[laughter]
Whoa!
[Astrid] Keep looking, he must be here somewhere.
So, how hard do you think we really need to look?

[bubbling screams]
[Fishlegs] Got you where I want you.
[Hiccup exclaiming]
Hookfang!
Oh, can this possibly get any worse?
[roaring]
Worse!
Way worse!
Aah!
Whoa!
Hey.
[growls]
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I will never try to give you away ever again!
What the...
- Whoa!
- [Hiccup] Toothless, watch out!
Come on, jump over!
Retreat?
In my moment of glory?
Never!
Whoa!
[roaring]
Aah!
[growling]
Yes, Meatlug!
No, Meatlug!
[growling]
Stop, dragon.
I, Thor Bonecrusher, command you to stop.
Raaah!
[grunting]
No!
[dragons snarling] [in Fishlegs' normal voice] No!
Not my Meatlug!
You leave my dragon alone!
No!
[roaring]
[Hiccup] That was a little too close.
Speak for yourself.
That was freakin' awesome!
[Scauldron roars]
Oh, I'm so sorry, girl.
I don't know what happened to me.
I just...
I wasn't myself.
[snarling]
Oh, I missed you!
Oh!
- How did I...
- Long story.
I'll explain later.
[Tuffnut] # Hooligan tribe Won't you come out tonight?
#
♪ Come out tonight Come out tonight... ♪
[all cheering]
So, what happened to the Scauldron?
He's been relocated.
- And my axe?
- Uh...
Also relocated.
But what of Thor Bonecrusher?
- Yeah, Bonecrusher!
- I miss him!
Whoo!
- Hello.
- No. [grumbling]
You know, Fishlegs, you didn't sneeze once the whole ride home.
Yeah.

(woman) previously on grimm...
What's the problem?
(sean) it appears to be related
To what my mother did to save my life.
Residual effect
From my visit to the other side.
I see the way you're looking at me.
- Juliette-- - it's not the same.
It'll never be the same.
(juliette) hi, you've reached juliette.
Leave a message.
We need to talk.
Please, please call me back.
I need a place to stay.
I can't go home until i figure out what i am.
I need you to open a book.
It's the book that adalind used
To do what she did to you and nick.
This, i want to read.
You are going to have another baby.
That's impossible.
I haven't been with anyone.
(henrietta) well, you must have been with someone.
You're just gonna have to have a different father,
Maybe a royal one.
It shouldn't be that hard to get him into bed.
Will i get a chance to say good-bye to victor?
No, another member of the family
Will be joining you soon.
There's nothing in here.
- What?
- For me or for you.
No, where is your mother?
She did this to me.
Juliette, she said there was a possibility
Of some side effects.
She didn't know this would happen to you.
Now, please.
You need to calm down.
No, i'm done calming down, okay?
You and nick and adalind and all of this wesen insanity,
I am so sick of it.
Okay, i was normal before i met all of you.
I want my life back.
And if i don't get it...
What?
You better watch out.
[sighs] [driving rock music]
¶ ¶
(ricky) hey, bella.
You were pumping it today.
Great ride, huh?
Of course, i had the best view.
I was right behind you.
My view was better.
You weren't in it.

When are we gonna go for a ride together,
Just the two of us?
Bikes optional.
(zack) knock it off, ricky.
- Knock what off?
- Just leave her alone.
Oh, oh, you're her bodyguard now.
You know what i'm saying.
Yeah, i know what you're saying.

Bella.
Bella, are you all right?
Oh, yeah, i'm okay.
Are you sure nothing's broken?
Yeah.
Good thing i was following you.
Following me?
Why?
I just need to talk to you.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Oh, it's okay.
Rick's a jerk.
You can't change that.
Look, i got to go.
Just hold on.
You're--you're always in such a hurry.
Zack, i really got to go.
No, look, you're bleeding.
- Don't.
- I'm not making this up.
I'm okay.
Look, bella.
I like you.
I think you're really great, if you'd just
Slow down long enough to have a conversation--
No.
Now, look, zack.
You're a really nice guy and everything, okay,
But i can't.
Oh, god.
Oh, god, get away!
You have to go.
What did i do?
Don't touch me.
You're hurt.
Please.
I'm not leaving you.
I'm in love with you.
Don't touch me.
No!
I told you.
What's happening?
[gasping]
[tense music]
¶ ¶
(juliette) hi, you've reached juliette.
Leave a message.
Juliette, it's me.
Call me.
I don't know what else to say.
You order yet?
No.
You going to order?
Nah.
Something going on?
Juliette walked out.
What, you guys have a fight?
[chuckles] a fight, i could deal with.
This...
Not so much.
What happened?
You know what we had to go through
To undo what adalind did?
Yeah.
Well, there was a side effect.
You all right?
Yeah, it's--
It's not what happened to me.
I don't like where this is going.
It doesn't get any better.
Juliette's a hexenbiest.
Run that past me again.
I knew something was wrong.
I just didn't know what.
And she was trying to figure out a way to tell me,
But she just--she couldn't.
So how'd you find out?
(juliette) there's something i have to show you.
How is this possible?
I don't know.
If i knew, i would never have put her through this.
All right, so what are you going to do?
I don't know.
I--
I don't even know what i'm dealing with.
Neither does she.
I don't have a lot of luck with hexenbiests.
And she might be afraid of what you might do to her.
Oh, man, this is really messed up.
Yeah.
Can you undo it?
Not from what i'm told.
[chuckles]
Man, no wonder you're not hungry.
If there's anything i can do to help...
Right now, she's not even talking to me.
[phone rings]
Burkhardt.
Where?
All right.
Got a dead body at mount tabor park.
[sighs]
(wu) cyclist discovered a bike on the trail up there
And a helmet,
Then saw the body down here.
Looks like some kind of allergic reaction,
But it doubt it's to the flora or fauna.
It doesn't look like acid.
Face isn't burned.
My guess is, it happened up there.
He was either overcome by something that happened earlier,
Like maybe he ate something that didn't agree with him
In a big way.
Zack blumenthal, 26 years old.
Lives over on thurman.
Organ donor, but i think that ship has sailed.
Do we think this is a homicide or an accident?
Or neither?
I figure we should wait for the m.E. Report.
Why don't we check out his place?
Hopefully, one of these keys will open it up.
[knocking at door]
Police!
Anybody home?
Police!
Coming in!
Drawing pictures of shoes.
Must be some kind of designer.
Well, it looks like he lives alone.
Not that that's a bad thing.
Yeah.
Do monroe and rosalee know about juliette?
Nope, just you.
You know you got to tell them.
Maybe she already has.
Got a photo.
A woman.
Pretty.
Got his laptop.
And drawings of a woman.
She looks the same.
Sister?
Girlfriend?
Definitely not his mother.
Well, he's paying this much attention to her,
We better figure out who she is.
[tearfully] mom?
(woman) what's wrong?
It happened.
I couldn't stop it.
(woman) where are you?
I'm at home.
The body there?
No.
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
Stay there.
I'm on my way.
Prince viktor's been sent back to vienna.
What?
I just found out myself.
My father must have grown impatient with him.
Is viktor dead?
[sighs] don't know.
What about adalind?
Haven't heard anything about her.
Who's replacing viktor?
I don't think anybody knows.
At least they're not telling me.
They didn't get rid of viktor because he's moving too fast.
They want kelly burkhardt and that child.
If you want me to go back there,
You got to give me something to show them.
I've got it ready.
[sighs]
You give them this.
It'll look like you're making progress.
Any of it true?
Enough to make it plausible.
All right.
(bella) i didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't even know he liked me.
(woman) you're a beautiful girl, bella.
I didn't do anything to encourage him, mom.
I swear.
What do i do?
You just go on with your life
As though nothing has happened.
How can i?
What happened is not your fault.
And what if somebody finds out?
No one can prove you did anything.
I still killed him, mom.
You do nothing.
You say nothing.
You understand?
Or do you want your life ruined the way mine was?
Looked through the vic's laptop.
Emails are pretty innocuous.
Nothing noteworthy in his search history.
He played a lot of cs:
Go.
Counter strike:
Global offensive.
Online tactical first-person shooter game.
Awesome in every way.
So i heard.
And then...
There were these.
Same woman he had a photo of on his fridge.
Looks like she wasn't aware anyone was taking her photo.
There is more of our mystery girl on zack's page.
(hank) she definitely meant something to this guy.
Do any of these photos link to her page?
No, they're not tagged,
And she doesn't seem to have her own page,
But...
She's on their main page photo.
They're tagged to river city riders.
They meet up for group rides several times a week.
Looks like they were both members.
Next ride is scheduled for today,
Starting at harvey scott memorial
At mount tabor park.
That's pretty close to where zack's body was found.
Well, let's see if she shows.
Excuse me.
Is there a problem?
Do you know a zack blumenthal?
Yeah, i know him.
If you're looking for him, he hasn't shown up yet.
Well, i'm sorry, but zack's dead.
What?
Oh, my god.
What do you mean, zack's dead?
His body was found yesterday morning
Off one of the trails.
(ricky) did he crash?
What happened?
We're still trying to figure that out.
And we're hoping to talk to whoever saw him last.
He was here for yesterday's ride.
We all saw him.
Anyone see him leave?
Yeah, i saw him leave.
He went after bella.
Is she here?
No, haven't seen her today.
Is this bella?
- Yes.
- Yeah, that's her.
Bella turner.
What was zack's relationship with bella?
I don't think he had one.
Nobody does with her.
What do you mean?
She's nice, but she...
Kind of keeps to herself.
She likes to ride more than she likes to hang out.
She never hangs out.
Any reason why zack would have a bunch of pictures of her
At his house?
Yeah, i think he's in love with her.
She never paid any attention to him.
You know where she lives?
No.
I mean, she never really talks.
She's a real pedal masher.
Nobody knows where she lives, only where she works.
City bikes on ankeny?
[phone rings]
I'm gonna need to get you guys' names.
Will, what do you got?
Prelim tox report from the m.E.
Anything in zach's medical records
About lethal allergies?
(wu) no, zack blumenthal was killed by a toxin
That caused acute systolic heart failure.
Basically, this guy's heart broke.
However, this toxin doesn't really exist.
And by "doesn't really exist," you mean what?
(wu) it's most closely related
To phyllobates terribilis,
A frog from the colombian jungles,
But not exactly.
It's a batrachotoxin, which is only found
In three poisonous frogs from colombia
And three poisonous birds from papua new guinea.
And i'm not even gonna try to pronounce the name
Of said frogs and birds.
And let me just add one ounce of this poison
Kills 10,000 mice, 10 to 20 humans,
And 2 african bull elephants.
How do i know this?
I looked it up.
So where did the poison that killed zack come from?
I think it's got to be wesen.
How did the m.E. Explain it?
She couldn't.
All right, we got a name for the woman in the photos.
It's bella turner.
Got it.
I'll run a background.
(adalind) why hasn't viktor called?
Is he still alive?
You shouldn't worry about viktor anymore.
Well, you're awfully loyal.
I'm loyal to the family,
Not to any particular member.
Am i a member of that family?
Your child is.
I thought that's why we came here.
Is anybody doing anything about finding her?
Believe me, the family knows how important she is.
The king is doing everything he can to-- [phone rings]
Excuse me.
Yes?
When?
No.
We'll be ready.
Ready for what?
[sighs]
Take care of this.
You might want to change into something more appropriate.
Why?
Well, i wouldn't want to meet prince kenneth in a robe.
Prince kenneth?
Do you know him?
By reputation.
Well, what's he like?
Results.
(hank) if zack went after bella, caught up with her,
Are we thinking she's a witness to what happened
Or involved?
(nick) might be either.
What's the motive?
They supposedly had no relationship.
Maybe zack thought they did.
All right, before we go in,
Are we thinking bella's wesen?
Well, could be.
If she is, we don't know what we're dealing with.
Only way we'll know is if i get her to woge.
If she is, let me know?
If i pull my gun, that'll be a good indication.
[bell rings]
I'm calling for bella turner.
Bella turner.
Yeah.
You know zack blumenthal?
Yeah, we're in the same cycling club.
Why?
Well, his body was found yesterday
Off of one of the biking trails.
Oh, my god.
Zack's dead?
What happened?
We were hoping you could help us figure that out.
Me?
We talked to some of your cycling club.
They said zack followed you.
We were wondering if you saw him again
After yesterday's ride.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, he caught up to me on the trail.
Did you two talk?
A little.
What about?
Look, um,
Zack was interested in going out, and i wasn't,
So i told him, and, you know, just got on my bike and left.
That was the last i saw him.
So you two weren't having a relationship.
No.
But he wanted to.
Yes, and i told him i wasn't interested.
How did he respond to that?
Was he upset?
I don't know!
Maybe, a little.
But that's not my fault.
[breathing heavily]
Look, zack didn't do anything, okay?
I just left.
Did he take his helmet off?
What?
When you were with him on the trail,
Did he take his helmet off?
Yeah, i guess.
(hank) we found his helmet and his bicycle on the trail
And his body in the ravine.
So you had to have been with him
At the same place that he died.
Come on, bella.
You were with him.
Have you ever heard of batrachotoxin?
No.
It's a poison that stops the heart
And makes you look like this.
What does this have to do with me?
How would i even do something like that?
You're free to check my gear.
If you guys think i have whatever that poison is,
Then go ahead.
Take a look.
That's my bike right there.
Well, that won't be necessary.
If you think of anything, give us a call.
She didn't woge.
Nope.
Well, she seemed pretty upset.
Is she wesen or not?
Well, if she is,
She's good at hiding it.
If she is, we better find out
What kind of wesen we're dealing with.
[door opens] [gasps] excuse me.
Aren't you supposed to knock before entering?
- He's here.
- In the hotel?
Closer.
Okay, well, just--
Kenneth, may i present adalind schade?
I...
So you're the hexenbiest mother of the child
Everyone's so obsessed with.
Yes.
I'm here for one reason,
And that's to get your child back to the family.
I understand you made contact with mr.
Burkhardt's girlfriend.
Juliette.
I did.
And how did that go?
Nick is a grimm again.
I was told you took care of that.
I did,
But he figured out a way to undo it.
That's possible?
I didn't think so.
But it does explain why juliette is now a hexenbiest.
I want that bitch dead.
Any other surprises for me?
Oh.
You're full of surprises.
Whose child is this?
Viktor's.
(rosalee) if it's secreting batrachotoxins
Through its skin, then touching is deadly.
And you're saying she didn't woge.
No.
See, i was thinking it was a peau de la mort,
But those rascals, you sneeze and they woge.
I think you're dealing with folterseele.
What is that?
Well, they're kind of classically tragic.
Always beautiful, always deadly.
Really?
You think a folterseele.
They're kind of rare, thank god,
And they don't woge like any other wesen.
Then how do they woge?
Well, it's not an emotional response.
It's more of a physical sexual one.
So, like, when they're aroused?
It's not them; it's whoever's turned on by them.
It's a defense mechanism.
Yeah, an extremely offensive defense mechanism.
Well, no wonder they're rare.
That sounds like the old frog prince story.
Yeah, but you kiss this frog,
Your face blows up and you die.
(nick) wait, let me see if i can get this straight.
The only way you can get a folterseele to woge
Is if you're sexually attracted to her?
Yeah, basically.
(hank) so we can't tie her to the crime
And we can't make her woge.
Interrogation room's not gonna work on this one.
(monroe) unless you guys get in there
And one of you is, like, totally into her, and then...
Really?
Well, why not?
(nick) so we can't make the arrest 'cause we don't have any evidence,
And i won't know if she's a folterseele 'cause i can't get her to woge.
Look, if you are dealing with the folterseele,
She's not doing this on purpose.
She's probably trying to avoid it.
A lot of men can't control themselves
Around the female folterseele.
Well, that's probably why she keeps to herself.
(monroe) exactly.
So many you guys need to just let this one go, you know,
Let the sleeping folterseele lie.
It could happen again.
[sighs]
What if we, i don't know,
Neutralize what's happening to her,
Like of like we did with that toad-eating lawyer?
Is that possible?
Won't know till we try.
Try.
Okay, i'll let you know what i find out.
Have you told viktor the blessed news?
Not yet.
Uh...
I was about to.
Right.
Well, i'm sure he'll be thrilled.
Damerov is here, sir.
Bring him in.
Hopefully, he has good news about the whereabouts
Of your...
Other child.
You were expecting prince viktor?
Yes.
He's been recalled.
I'm kenneth.
I've heard a lot about you, sam.
Have you found kelly burkhardt or adalind's child?
Not yet, but i've made progress.
Progress?
Is that what's in the briefcase?
Yes.
We know that she sold the truck in spokane.
We believe she's still in the area with the child.
You know, the problem with being a double agent, sam,
Is that you never really know where your loyalties lie.
I work for the family, sir.
Not anymore.
I'm a little more hands on than viktor,
Who, i'm sorry to say, is sterile.
So you might want to rethink who the father is.
Hey, bella.
Sorry, ricky, we're closing.
I didn't come about my bike.
You heard about zack?
I can't believe it.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
Thanks.
You know, zack was pretty stupid about you.
What are you talking about?
[laughs] you're telling me
You didn't know he was in love with you.
Look, i just want to be left alone, okay?
[clicking tongue]
But he was never good enough for you, was he?
You got to go.
I got to lock up.
(ricky) it's too bad about zack.
He was always watching your back.
And such a nice back.
Get out.
You're a stuck up bitch
Who thinks she's too good for anybody.
Ricky, what are you doing?
Zack was an okay guy, and now he's dead,
And i think it's because of you,
So i came to get what you never gave him.
[snarls] [breathing heavily]
No, no, no!
You don't know what's gonna happen.
Yeah, i do.
What the hell?
[gasping]
What are you?
(man) 911.
What's your emergency?
Hurry!
If you don't get here fast...
He's dying, and i don't know what to do!
Juliette, where the hell are you?
Just answer your damn phone.
[computer bleeps]
(juliette) nick?
Juliette.
I need to get some of my stuff.
What, so you're just...
Moving out.
I was hoping you wouldn't be home.
Look, can we talk about this?
There's really nothing you or anybody else can say
Or do.
This is who i am.
Juliette, this is my fault, and if there's anything
I could do to change it, i would.
I know that.
I haven't given up yet.
Why not?
Because i love you.
[laughs]
That's-- that's great.
That's really great.
Juliette-- [phone rings]
Answer it.
Come on, nick.
There's a lot of big, scary wesen on the loose in portland.
That's what you're good at.
Go get 'em, grimm.
[ringing continues]
Hank.
Where?
(hank) this is rick thornton,
One of the guys from the cycling club.
Wouldn't be able to tell from looking at him.
Who called 911?
Came from the shop phone, woman's voice.
No identity was given.
Call ended eight seconds after it was made.
We think that was bella?
That's what i'm thinking.
You run a background on her?
I did.
She was clean.
Not even a traffic ticket.
Anyone else on the premises?
(wu) no, not when we got here.
Shop was unlocked.
Alarm had not been set.
We contacted the owner.
He was at home.
Got here about five minutes ago.
All right, let's talk to him.
(hank) what time did you close up tonight?
I didn't.
I left early.
Bella stayed late.
She was supposed to close up.
Those are her keys on the floor over there.
Is that guy really dead?
(nick) i'm afraid so.
Bella's not back there, is she?
No.
[sighs] i tried to get a hold of her
As soon as i heard.
She's--she's not answering.
I'm really worried about her.
Do you have bella's home address?
Yeah, yeah,
I got it on my phone.
Bella, it's the police.
We need you to open up.
Bella.
Clear.
Bedroom clear.
I got some photos.
(wu) that's a nasty scar.
Looks like some kind of burn.
(hank) could that be her mother?
I think we ought to find out.
[phone buzzes]
It's about time.
How'd it go?
(damerov) i gave them the information.
Did they replace viktor?
They did.
Prince kenneth is now in charge.
Kenneth.
I know of him.
I just don't know much about his branch of the family.
(damerov) we shouldn't underestimate him.
I got the impression he doesn't have much patience.
He wants kelly burkhardt and the child.
I'm gonna need to deliver something real soon.
Well, i'll come up with something.
(damerov) no, we can't keep stalling.
If he finds out i'm working for you...
I'm dead.
I'm not sure we should even be talking
About this on the phone.
Well, then come to my office.
No, it's too dangerous now.
I don't trust them.
And they probably don't trust me.
All right, then where?
(damerov) i told them i was going back to spokane tonight.
Meet me at the...
Willamette paper mill.
At 9:00.
You got to have something i can give them by then.
It's my life on the line here.
Don't screw with me.
You'll regret it.
Bravo.
I think we're good here.
[sniffles]
Got something interesting here on bella's mom.
Police report from 1989.
Cindy turner was victim of a rape.
That's her?
No scarring.
Well, the picture was taken 24 years ago.
Same night she was attacked.
"suspect william ashford
"attacked victim cindy turner outside spackle's bar and grill
But died at the scene."
No charges filed against turner.
All right, well, let's find out how he died.
Whoa.
That looks familiar.
He died the same way our vics died.
And bella and her mom have got to be the same.
Ashford's death was ruled accidental.
Cause of death:
Severe allergic reaction
To something unknown.
[phone rings] rosalee.
I think we've got something that might work,
But no guarantees.
It's never been tried.
What i think we have to do is depolarize her membranes
By either using a tetrodotoxin or a saxitoxin,
Both of which should have antagonistic effects
To the poison she secretes.
This would allow us to block her
From creating the poison in the first place.
Any side effects?
Yeah, these are some hardcore toxins
We're dealing with here.
I can't imagine there wouldn't be--
And probably not very good ones.
But it's better than her being out there killing people.
(rosalee) it's not as if she has a choice here.
Do it.
Got to go.
Got a dmv
On bella's mom, cindy turner.
The address on her license is in gresham.
Let's go.
(cindy) bella?
I saw your bike.
What are you doing here?
[tearfully] mom.
What's wrong, honey?
It happened again,
But it wasn't my fault.
He attacked me, and i told him to leave me alone.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's not okay, mom.
The police are gonna think that i did it.
It doesn't matter what the police think.
I can't go back there.
You don't have to.
Look, i'm gonna go back to the house,
Get you something to eat.
You just rest, hmm?
I'll take care of everything.
No.
No, you don't!
What happened?
Nothing.
Don't lie to me.
It's not her fault, mom.
It doesn't matter.
It has to be done.
No.
It's for her own good.
I will not do this to my daughter.
You won't have to.
I will.
[tense music]
¶ ¶
[knocking at door]
Hey, forget knocking.
There's a woman on the floor.
She's not moving.
She's got blood in the back of her head.
All right, she's got a pulse.
I'm calling an ambulance.
[bella screams]
Bella.
It's okay.
Police.
You don't understand.
My mother's with her.
[bella screaming]
Do you want to keep on killing?
No!
(sheila) do you want to be raped like your mother and me?
No!
You have to do what we all have to do.
It's for your own good.
[screaming]
(nick) police!
No.
No!
Thank god.
You think you saved her?
Oh, you haven't saved her from anything.
Well, maybe we have.
You need to come with us.
It's not her fault.
You can't arrest her.
We know.
(nick) there might be another way.
(rosalee) if you drink this,
We believe it will keep your touch from killing anyone.
And you're sure it'll work?
No.
It's never been tried.
Of if it has been, there's no record.
Usually, that means not such a good outcome.
It may affect you in ways we have no way of predicting.
Not exactly, um, fda approved, you know?
(nick) look.
I know a thing or two about side effects.
You really want to think about this.
You don't know what it's like
To never be able to experience love.
Never feel the touch of another person
Or be able to touch them.
[sighs]
I don't care about the side effects.
[exhales]
It can't be worse than what happens now.
Sam.
Sam?
Sean renard.
We haven't met.
I'm kenneth.
Did you kill him?
I did.
But he sort of had it coming,
Trying to trick the family into believing
He knew where kelly burkhardt and the child were.
Well, i should arrest you.
Well, my confession is just between the two of us.
The king is extremely annoyed with how things have progressed.
He desperately wants his granddaughter.
And i've been tasked with the responsibility
Of making that happen.
There's no need for guns.
Nobody's going to shoot anybody.
If i wanted you dead, you'd be dead.
So...
This is when you tell me
How important i am to the family
And that we should join forces.
No.
[chuckles]
Going there, are we?
Oh!
[coughing]
This is where i tell you
How important i am to the family.
And unless you join forces with me,
You'll end up like your friend damerov.
And the king will mourn the loss
Of another son.
Think about it.
[soft jazz music playing]
(man) ¶ who will never, ever let you down ¶
¶ just the kind of man ¶
¶ who will always stick around ¶
¶ ¶
I always think that these first dates
Are so awkward.
You never know what to say or what not to say,
What someone's gonna like or not like.
And i guess i'm just trying really hard
Not to sound like an idiot.
I really like you.
I really like you too.
So are you sure you're not bothered by the way i look?
I think you're a knockout.
[laughs]
(woman) Previously on Grimm...
What's the problem?
(Sean) It appears to be related to what my mother did to save my life.
Residual effect from my visit to the other side.
I see the way you're looking at me.
- Juliette...
- It's not the same.
It'll never be the same.
(Juliette) Hi, you've reached Juliette.
Leave a message.
We need to talk.
Please, please call me back.
I need a place to stay.
I can't go home until I figure out what I am.
I need you to open a book.
It's the book that Adalind used to do what she did to you and Nick.
This, I want to read.
You are going to have another baby.
That's impossible.
I haven't been with anyone.
(Henrietta) Well, you must have been with someone.
You're just gonna have to have a different father, maybe a royal one.
It shouldn't be that hard to get him into bed.
Will I get a chance to say good-bye to Victor?
No, another member of the family will be joining you soon.
__
There's nothing in here.
- What?
- For me or for you.
No, where is your mother?
She did this to me.
Juliette, she said there was a possibility of some side effects.
She didn't know this would happen to you.
Now, please.
You need to calm down.
No, I'm done calming down, okay?
You and Nick and Adalind and all of this Wesen insanity,
I am so sick of it.
Okay, I was normal before I met all of you.

(Juliette) Hi, you've reached Juliette.
Leave a message.
Juliette, it's me.
Call me.
I don't know what else to say.
You order yet?
No.
You going to order?
Nah.
Something going on?
Juliette walked out.
What, you guys have a fight?
[chuckles] A fight, I could deal with.
This... not so much.
What happened?
You know what we had to go through to undo what Adalind did?
Yeah.
Well, there was a side effect.
You all right?
Yeah, it's...
It's not what happened to me.
I don't like where this is going.
It doesn't get any better.
Juliette's a Hexenbiest.
Run that past me again.
I knew something was wrong.
I just didn't know what.
And she was trying to figure out a way to tell me, but she just... she couldn't.
So how'd you find out?
(Juliette) There's something I have to show you.
How is this possible?
I don't know.
If I knew, I would never have put her through this.
All right, so what are you going to do?
I don't know.
I...
I don't even know what I'm dealing with.
Neither does she.
I don't have a lot of luck with Hexenbiests.
And she might be afraid of what you might do to her.
Oh, man, this is really messed up.
Yeah.
Can you undo it?
Not from what I'm told.

Man, no wonder you're not hungry.
If there's anything I can do to help...
Right now, she's not even talking to me.
[phone rings]
Burkhardt.
Where?
All right.
Got a dead body at Mount Tabor Park.
[sighs]
(Wu) Cyclist discovered a bike on the trail up there and a helmet, then saw the body down here.
Looks like some kind of allergic reaction, but it doubt it's to the flora or fauna.
It doesn't look like acid.
Face isn't burned.
My guess is, it happened up there.
He was either overcome by something that happened earlier, like maybe he ate something that didn't agree with him in a big way.
Zack Blumenthal, 26 years old.
Lives over on Thurman.
Organ donor, but I think that ship has sailed.
Do we think this is a homicide or an accident?
Or neither?
I figure we should wait for the M.E. report.
Why don't we check out his place?
Hopefully, one of these keys will open it up.
[knocking at door]
Police!
Anybody home?
Police!
Coming in!
Drawing pictures of shoes.
Must be some kind of designer.
Well, it looks like he lives alone.
Not that that's a bad thing.
Yeah.
Do Monroe and Rosalee know about Juliette?
Nope, just you.
You know you got to tell them.
Maybe she already has.
Got a photo.
A woman.
Pretty.
Got his laptop.
And drawings of a woman.
She looks the same.
Sister?
Girlfriend?
Definitely not his mother.
Well, he's paying this much attention to her, we better figure out who she is.
[tearfully] Mom?
(woman) What's wrong?
It happened.
I couldn't stop it.
(woman) Where are you?
I'm at home.
The body there?
No.
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
Stay there.
I'm on my way.
Prince Viktor's been sent back to Vienna.
What?
I just found out myself.
My father must have grown impatient with him.
Is Viktor dead?
[sighs] Don't know.
What about Adalind?
Haven't heard anything about her.
Who's replacing Viktor?
I don't think anybody knows.
At least they're not telling me.
They didn't get rid of Viktor because he's moving too fast.
They want Kelly Burkhardt and that child.
If you want me to go back there, you got to give me something to show them.
I've got it ready.
[sighs]
You give them this.
It'll look like you're making progress.
Any of it true?
Enough to make it plausible.
All right.
(Bella) I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't even know he liked me.
(woman) You're a beautiful girl, Bella.
I didn't do anything to encourage him, Mom.
I swear.
What do I do?
You just go on with your life as though nothing has happened.
How can I?
What happened is not your fault.
And what if somebody finds out?
No one can prove you did anything.
I still killed him, Mom.
You do nothing.
You say nothing.
You understand?
Or do you want your life ruined the way mine was?
Looked through the vic's laptop.
Emails are pretty innocuous.
Nothing noteworthy in his search history.
He played a lot of CS:
GO.
Counter Strike:
Global Offensive.
Online tactical first-person shooter game.
Awesome in every way.
So I heard.
And then... there were these.
Same woman he had a photo of on his fridge.
Looks like she wasn't aware anyone was taking her photo.
There is more of our mystery girl on Zack's page.
(Hank) She definitely meant something to this guy.
Do any of these photos link to her page?
No, they're not tagged, and she doesn't seem to have her own page, but, check this out...
I've clicked on the photos.
They're tagged to River City Riders.
They meet up for group rides a few times a week.
Looks like they were both members.
Next ride is scheduled for today, starting at Harvey Scott Memorial at Mount Tabor Park.
That's pretty close to where Zack's body was found.
Well, let's see if she shows.
Excuse me.
Is there a problem?
Do you know a Zack Blumenthal?
Yeah, I know him.
If you're looking for him, he hasn't shown up yet.
Well, I'm sorry, but Zack's dead.
What?
Oh, my god.
What do you mean, Zack's dead?
His body was found yesterday morning off one of the trails.
(Ricky) Did he crash?
What happened?
We're still trying to figure that out.
And we're hoping to talk to whoever saw him last.
He was here for yesterday's ride.
We all saw him.
Anyone see him leave?
Yeah, I saw him leave.
He went after Bella.
Is she here?
No, haven't seen her today.
Is this Bella?
- Yes.
- Yeah, that's her.
Bella Turner.
What was Zack's relationship with Bella?
I don't think he had one.
Nobody does with her.
What do you mean?
She's nice, but she... kind of keeps to herself.
She likes to ride more than she likes to hang out.
She never hangs out.
Any reason why Zack would have a bunch of pictures of her at his house?
Yeah, I think he's in love with her.
She never paid any attention to him.
You know where she lives?
No.
I mean, she never really talks.
She's a real pedal masher.
Nobody knows where she lives, only where she works.
City Bikes on Ankeny?
[phone rings]
I'm gonna need to get you guys' names.
Will, what do you got?
Prelim tox report from the M.E.
Anything in Zach's medical records about lethal allergies?
(Wu) No, Zack Blumenthal was killed by a toxin that caused acute systolic heart failure.
Basically, this guy's heart broke.
However, this toxin doesn't really exist.
And by "doesn't really exist," you mean what?
(Wu) It's most closely related to Phyllobates terribilis, a frog from the Colombian jungles, but not exactly.
It's a batrachotoxin, which is only found in three poisonous frogs from Colombia and three poisonous birds from Papua New Guinea.
And I'm not even gonna try to pronounce the name of said frogs and birds.
And let me just add one ounce of this poison kills 10,000 mice, 10 to 20 humans, and 2 African bull elephants.
How do I know this?
I looked it up.
So where did the poison that killed Zack come from?
I think it's got to be Wesen.
How did the M.E. explain it?
She couldn't.
All right, we got a name for the woman in the photos.
It's Bella Turner.
Got it.
I'll run a background.
(Adalind) Why hasn't Viktor called?
Is he still alive?
You shouldn't worry about Viktor anymore.
Well, you're awfully loyal.
I'm loyal to the family, not to any particular member.
Am I a member of that family?
Your child is.
I thought that's why we came here.
Is anybody doing anything about finding her?
Believe me, the family knows how important she is.
The king is doing everything he can to... [phone rings]
Excuse me.
Yes?
When?
No.
We'll be ready.
Ready for what?
[sighs]
Take care of this.
You might want to change into something more appropriate.
Why?
Well, I wouldn't want to meet Prince Kenneth in a robe.
Prince Kenneth?
Do you know him?
By reputation.
Well, what's he like?
Results.
(Hank) If Zack went after Bella, caught up with her, are we thinking she's a witness to what happened or involved?
(Nick) Might be either.
What's the motive?
They supposedly had no relationship.
Maybe Zack thought they did.
All right, before we go in, are we thinking Bella's Wesen?
Well, could be.
If she is, we don't know what we're dealing with.
Only way we'll know is if I get her to woge.
If she is, let me know?
If I pull my gun, that'll be a good indication.
[bell rings]
I'm calling for Bella Turner.
Bella Turner.
Yeah.
You know Zack Blumenthal?
Yeah, we're in the same cycling club.
Why?
Well, his body was found yesterday off of one of the biking trails.
Oh, my god.
Zack's dead?
What happened?
We were hoping you could help us figure that out.
Me?
We talked to some of your cycling club.
They said Zack followed you.
We were wondering if you saw him again after yesterday's ride.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, he caught up to me on the trail.
Did you two talk?
A little.
What about?
Look, um,
Zack was interested in going out, and I wasn't, so I told him, and, you know, just got on my bike and left.
That was the last I saw him.
So you two weren't having a relationship.
No.
But he wanted to.
Yes, and I told him I wasn't interested.
How did he respond to that?
Was he upset?
I don't know!
Maybe, a little.
But that's not my fault.
[breathing heavily]
Look, Zack didn't do anything, okay?
I just left.
Did he take his helmet off?
What?
When you were with him on the trail, did he take his helmet off?
Yeah, I guess.
(Hank) We found his helmet and his bicycle on the trail and his body in the ravine.
So you had to have been with him at the same place that he died.
Come on, Bella.
You were with him.
Have you ever heard of batrachotoxin?
No.
It's a poison that stops the heart and makes you look like this.
What does this have to do with me?
How would I even do something like that?
You're free to check my gear.
If you guys think I have whatever that poison is, then go ahead.
Take a look.
That's my bike right there.
Well, that won't be necessary.
If you think of anything, give us a call.
She didn't woge.
Nope.
Well, she seemed pretty upset.
Is she Wesen or not?
Well, if she is, she's good at hiding it.
If she is, we better find out what kind of Wesen we're dealing with.
[door opens] [gasps] Excuse me.
Aren't you supposed to knock before entering?
- He's here.
- In the hotel?
Closer.
Okay, well, just...
Kenneth, may I present Adalind Schade?
I...
So you're the Hexenbiest mother of the child everyone's so obsessed with.
Yes.
I'm here for one reason, and that's to get your child back to the family.
I understand you made contact with Mr. Burkhardt's girlfriend.
Juliette.
I did.
And how did that go?
Nick is a Grimm again.
I was told you took care of that.
I did, but he figured out a way to undo it.
That's possible?
I didn't think so.
But it does explain why Juliette is now a Hexenbiest.
I want that bitch dead.
Any other surprises for me?
Oh.
You're full of surprises.
Whose child is this?
Viktor's.
(Rosalee) If it's secreting batrachotoxins through its skin, then touching is deadly.
And you're saying she didn't woge.
No.
See, I was thinking it was a Peau de la Mort, but those rascals, you sneeze and they woge.
I think you're dealing with Folterseele.
What is that?
Well, they're kind of classically tragic.
Always beautiful, always deadly.
Really?
You think a Folterseele.
They're kind of rare, thank God, and they don't woge like any other Wesen.
Then how do they woge?
Well, it's not an emotional response.
It's more of a physical sexual one.
So, like, when they're aroused?
It's not them; it's whoever's turned on by them.
It's a defense mechanism.
Yeah, an extremely offensive defense mechanism.
Well, no wonder they're rare.
That sounds like the old Frog Prince story.
Yeah, but you kiss this frog, your face blows up and you die.
(Nick) Wait, let me see if I can get this straight.
The only way you can get a Folterseele to woge is if you're sexually attracted to her?
Yeah, basically.
(Hank) So we can't tie her to the crime and we can't make her woge.
Interrogation room's not gonna work on this one.
(Monroe) Unless you guys get in there and one of you is, like, totally into her, and then...
Really?
Well, why not?
(Nick) So we can't make the arrest 'cause we don't have any evidence, and I won't know if she's a Folterseele 'cause I can't get her to woge.
Look, if you are dealing with the Folterseele, she's not doing this on purpose.
She's probably trying to avoid it.
A lot of men can't control themselves around the female Folterseele.
Well, that's probably why she keeps to herself.
(Monroe) Exactly.
So many you guys need to just let this one go, you know, let the sleeping Folterseele lie.
It could happen again.
[sighs]
What if we, I don't know, neutralize what's happening to her, like of like we did with that toad-eating lawyer?
Is that possible?
Won't know till we try.
Try.
Okay, I'll let you know what I find out.
Have you told Viktor the blessed news?
Not yet.
Uh...
I was about to.
Right.
Well, I'm sure he'll be thrilled.
Damerov is here, sir.
Bring him in.
Hopefully, he has good news about the whereabouts of your... other child.
You were expecting Prince Viktor?
Yes.
He's been recalled.
I'm Kenneth.
I've heard a lot about you, Sam.
Have you found Kelly Burkhardt or Adalind's child?
Not yet, but I've made progress.
Progress?
Is that what's in the briefcase?
Yes.
We know that she sold the truck in Spokane.
We believe she's still in the area with the child.
You know, the problem with being a double agent, Sam, is that you never really know where your loyalties lie.
I work for the family, sir.
Not anymore.
I'm a little more hands on than Viktor, who, I'm sorry to say, is sterile.
So you might want to rethink who the father is.
Hey, Bella.
Sorry, Ricky, we're closing.
I didn't come about my bike.
You heard about Zack?
I can't believe it.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
Thanks.
You know, Zack was pretty stupid about you.
What are you talking about?
[laughs] You're telling me you didn't know he was in love with you.
Look, I just want to be left alone, okay?
[clicking tongue]
But he was never good enough for you, was he?
You got to go.
I got to lock up.
(Ricky) It's too bad about Zack.
He was always watching your back.
And such a nice back.
Get out.
You're a stuck up bitch who thinks she's too good for anybody.
Ricky, what are you doing?
Zack was an okay guy, and now he's dead, and I think it's because of you, so I came to get what you never gave him.
[snarls] [breathing heavily]
No, no, no!
You don't know what's gonna happen.
Yeah, I do.
What the hell?
[gasping]
What are you?
(man) 911.
What's your emergency?
Hurry!
If you don't get here fast...
He's dying, and I don't know what to do!
Juliette, where the hell are you?
Just answer your damn phone.
[computer bleeps]
(Juliette) Nick?
Juliette.
I need to get some of my stuff.
What, so you're just...
moving out.
I was hoping you wouldn't be home.
Look, can we talk about this?
There's really nothing you or anybody else can say or do.
This is who I am.
Juliette, this is my fault, and if there's anything
I could do to change it, I would.
I know that.
I haven't given up yet.
Why not?
Because I love you.
[laughs]
That's...
That's great.
That's really great.
Juliette... [phone rings]
Answer it.
Come on, Nick.
There's a lot of big, scary Wesen on the loose in Portland.
That's what you're good at.
Go get 'em, Grimm.
[ringing continues]
Hank.
Where?
(Hank) This is Rick Thornton, one of the guys from the cycling club.
Wouldn't be able to tell from looking at him.
Who called 911?
Came from the shop phone, woman's voice.
No identity was given.
Call ended eight seconds after it was made.
We think that was Bella?
That's what I'm thinking.
You run a background on her?
I did.
She was clean.
Not even a traffic ticket.
Anyone else on the premises?
(Wu) No, not when we got here.
Shop was unlocked.
Alarm had not been set.
We contacted the owner.
He was at home.
Got here about five minutes ago.
All right, let's talk to him.
(Hank) What time did you close up tonight?
I didn't.
I left early.
Bella stayed late.
She was supposed to close up.
Those are her keys on the floor over there.
Is that guy really dead?
(Nick) I'm afraid so.
Bella's not back there, is she?
No.
[sighs] I tried to get a hold of her as soon as I heard.
She's... she's not answering.
I'm really worried about her.
Do you have Bella's home address?
Yeah, yeah,
I got it on my phone.
Bella, it's the police.
We need you to open up.
Bella.
Clear.
Bedroom clear.
I got some photos.
(Wu) That's a nasty scar.
Looks like some kind of burn.
(Hank) Could that be her mother?
I think we ought to find out.
[phone buzzes]
It's about time.
How'd it go?
(Damerov) I gave them the information.
Did they replace Viktor?
They did.
Prince Kenneth is now in charge.
Kenneth.
I know of him.
I just don't know much about his branch of the family.
(Damerov) We shouldn't underestimate him.
I got the impression he doesn't have much patience.
He wants Kelly Burkhardt and the child.
I'm gonna need to deliver something real soon.
Well, I'll come up with something.
(Damerov) No, we can't keep stalling.
If he finds out I'm working for you...
I'm dead.
I'm not sure we should even be talking about this on the phone.
Well, then come to my office.
No, it's too dangerous now.
I don't trust them.
And they probably don't trust me.
All right, then where?
(Damerov) I told them I was going back to Spokane tonight.
Meet me at the...
Willamette paper mill.
At 9:00.
You got to have something I can give them by then.
It's my life on the line here.
Don't screw with me.
You'll regret it.
Bravo.
I think we're good here.
[sniffles]
Got something interesting here on Bella's mom.
Police report from 1989.
Cindy Turner was victim of a rape.
That's her?
No scarring.
Well, the picture was taken 24 years ago.
Same night she was attacked.
"Suspect William Ashford
"attacked victim Cindy Turner outside Spackle's Bar and Grill but died at the scene."
No charges filed against Turner.
All right, well, let's find out how he died.
Whoa.
That looks familiar.
He died the same way our vics died.
And Bella and her mom have got to be the same.
Ashford's death was ruled accidental.
Cause of death:
severe allergic reaction to something unknown.
[phone rings] Rosalee.
I think we've got something that might work, but no guarantees.
It's never been tried.
What I think we have to do is depolarize her membranes by either using a tetrodotoxin or a saxitoxin, both of which should have antagonistic effects to the poison she secretes.
This would allow us to block her from creating the poison in the first place.
Any side effects?
Yeah, these are some hardcore toxins we're dealing with here.
I can't imagine there wouldn't be...
And probably not very good ones.
But it's better than her being out there killing people.
(Rosalee) It's not as if she has a choice here.
Do it.
Got to go.
Got a DMV on Bella's mom, Cindy Turner.
The address on her license is in Gresham.
Let's go.
(Cindy) Bella?
I saw your bike.
What are you doing here?
[tearfully] Mom.
What's wrong, honey?
It happened again, but it wasn't my fault.
He attacked me, and I told him to leave me alone.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's not okay, Mom.
The police are gonna think that I did it.
It doesn't matter what the police think.
I can't go back there.
You don't have to.
Look, I'm gonna go back to the house, get you something to eat.
You just rest, hmm?
I'll take care of everything.
No.
No, you don't!
What happened?
Nothing.
Don't lie to me.
It's not her fault, Mom.
It doesn't matter.
It has to be done.
No.
It's for her own good.
I will not do this to my daughter.
You won't have to.
I will.
[tense music]
[knocking at door]
Hey, forget knocking.
There's a woman on the floor.
She's not moving.
She's got blood in the back of her head.
All right, she's got a pulse.
I'm calling an ambulance.
[Bella screams]
Bella.
It's okay.
Police.
You don't understand.
My mother's with her.
[Bella screaming]
Do you want to keep on killing?
No!
(Sheila) Do you want to be raped like your mother and me?
No!
You have to do what we all have to do.
It's for your own good.
[screaming]
(Nick) Police!
No.
No!
Thank God.
You think you saved her?
Oh, you haven't saved her from anything.
Well, maybe we have.
You need to come with us.
It's not her fault.
You can't arrest her.
We know.
(Nick) There might be another way.
(Rosalee) If you drink this, we believe it will keep your touch from killing anyone.
And you're sure it'll work?
No.
It's never been tried.
Of if it has been, there's no record.
Usually, that means not such a good outcome.
It may affect you in ways we have no way of predicting.
Not exactly, um, FDA approved, you know?
(Nick) Look.
I know a thing or two about side effects.
You really want to think about this.
You don't know what it's like to never be able to experience love.
Never feel the touch of another person or be able to touch them.
[sighs]
I don't care about the side effects.
[exhales]
It can't be worse than what happens now.
Sam.
Sam?
Sean Renard.
We haven't met.
I'm Kenneth.
Did you kill him?
I did.
But he sort of had it coming, trying to trick the family into believing he knew where Kelly Burkhardt and the child were.
Well, I should arrest you.
Well, my confession is just between the two of us.
The king is extremely annoyed with how things have progressed.
He desperately wants his granddaughter.
And I've been tasked with the responsibility of making that happen.
There's no need for guns.
Nobody's going to shoot anybody.
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.
So... this is when you tell me how important I am to the family and that we should join forces.
No.
[chuckles]
Going there, are we?
Oh!
[coughing]
This is where I tell you how important I am to the family.
And unless you join forces with me, you'll end up like your friend Damerov.
And the king will mourn the loss of another son.
Think about it.

What's the problem?
It appears to be related to what my mother did to save my life.

It'll never be the same.
Hi, you've reached Juliette.

That's impossible.
I haven't been with anyone.
Well, you must have been with someone.
You're just gonna have to have a different father, maybe a royal one.
It shouldn't be that hard to get him into bed.
Will I get a chance to say good-bye to Victor?
No, another member of the family will be joining you soon.

There's nothing in here.
- What?
- For me or for you.
No, where is your mother?
She did this to me.
Juliette, she said there was a possibility of some side effects.
She didn't know this would happen to you.
Now, please.
You need to calm down.
No, I'm done calming down, okay?
You and Nick and Adalind and all of this Wesen insanity,
I am so sick of it.
Okay, I was normal before I met all of you.
I want my life back.
And if I don't get it...
What?
You better watch out.

Hey, Bella.

Great ride, huh?
Of course, I had the best view.
I was right behind you.
My view was better.
You weren't in it.
When are we gonna go for a ride together, just the two of us?
Bikes optional.
Knock it off, Ricky.

Oh, oh, you're her bodyguard now.

Good thing I was following you.

I'm sorry about what happened.
Oh, it's okay.
Rick's a jerk.
You can't change that.
Look, I got to go.
Just hold on.
You're... you're always in such a hurry.
Zack, I really got to go.
No, look, you're bleeding.
- Don't.
- I'm not making this up.
I'm okay.
Look, Bella.
I like you.
I think you're really great, if you'd just slow down long enough to have a conversation...
No.
Now, look, Zack.
You're a really nice guy and everything, okay, but I can't.
Oh, god.
Oh, god, get away!
You have to go.

Hi, you've reached Juliette.
Leave a message.
Juliette, it's me.
Call me.
I don't know what else to say.
You order yet?
No.
You going to order?
Nah.
Something going on?
Juliette walked out.
What, you guys have a fight?
A fight, I could deal with.
This... not so much.
What happened?
You know what we had to go through to undo what Adalind did?
Yeah.
Well, there was a side effect.
You all right?
Yeah, it's...
It's not what happened to me.
I don't like where this is going.
It doesn't get any better.
Juliette's a Hexenbiest.
Run that past me again.
I knew something was wrong.
I just didn't know what.
And she was trying to figure out a way to tell me, but she just... she couldn't.
So how'd you find out?
There's something I have to show you.
How is this possible?
I don't know.
If I knew, I would never have put her through this.
All right, so what are you going to do?
I don't know.
I...
I don't even know what I'm dealing with.
Neither does she.
I don't have a lot of luck with Hexenbiests.
And she might be afraid of what you might do to her.
Oh, man, this is really messed up.
Yeah.
Can you undo it?
Not from what I'm told.
Man, no wonder you're not hungry.
If there's anything I can do to help...
Right now, she's not even talking to me.
Burkhardt.
Where?
All right.
Got a dead body at Mount Tabor Park.
Cyclist discovered a bike on the trail up there and a helmet, then saw the body down here.
Looks like some kind of allergic reaction, but it doubt it's to the flora or fauna.
It doesn't look like acid.
Face isn't burned.
My guess is, it happened up there.
He was either overcome by something that happened earlier, like maybe he ate something that didn't agree with him in a big way.
Zack Blumenthal, 26 years old.
Lives over on Thurman.
Organ donor, but I think that ship has sailed.
Do we think this is a homicide or an accident?
Or neither?
I figure we should wait for the M.E. report.
Why don't we check out his place?
Hopefully, one of these keys will open it up.
Police!
Anybody home?
Police!
Coming in!
Drawing pictures of shoes.
Must be some kind of designer.
Well, it looks like he lives alone.
Not that that's a bad thing.
Yeah.
Do Monroe and Rosalee know about Juliette?
Nope, just you.
You know you got to tell them.
Maybe she already has.
Got a photo.
A woman.
Pretty.
Got his laptop.
And drawings of a woman.
She looks the same.
Sister?
Girlfriend?
Definitely not his mother.
Well, he's paying this much attention to her, we better figure out who she is.
Mom?
What's wrong?
It happened.
I couldn't stop it.
Where are you?
I'm at home.
The body there?
No.
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
Stay there.
I'm on my way.
Prince Viktor's been sent back to Vienna.
What?
I just found out myself.
My father must have grown impatient with him.
Is Viktor dead?
Don't know.
What about Adalind?
Haven't heard anything about her.
Who's replacing Viktor?
I don't think anybody knows.
At least they're not telling me.
They didn't get rid of Viktor because he's moving too fast.
They want Kelly Burkhardt and that child.
If you want me to go back there, you got to give me something to show them.
I've got it ready.
You give them this.
It'll look like you're making progress.
Any of it true?
Enough to make it plausible.
All right.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't even know he liked me.
You're a beautiful girl, Bella.
I didn't do anything to encourage him, Mom.
I swear.
What do I do?
You just go on with your life as though nothing has happened.
How can I?
What happened is not your fault.
And what if somebody finds out?
No one can prove you did anything.
I still killed him, Mom.
You do nothing.
You say nothing.
You understand?
Or do you want your life ruined the way mine was?
Looked through the vic's laptop.
Emails are pretty innocuous.
Nothing noteworthy in his search history.
He played a lot of CS:
GO.
Counter Strike:
Global Offensive.
Online tactical first-person shooter game.
Awesome in every way.
So I heard.
And then... there were these.
Same woman he had a photo of on his fridge.
Looks like she wasn't aware anyone was taking her photo.
There is more of our mystery girl on Zack's page.
She definitely meant something to this guy.
Do any of these photos link to her page?
No, they're not tagged, and she doesn't seem to have her own page, but, check this out...
I've clicked on the photos.
They're tagged to River City Riders.
They meet up for group rides a few times a week.
Looks like they were both members.
Next ride is scheduled for today, starting at Harvey Scott Memorial at Mount Tabor Park.
That's pretty close to where Zack's body was found.
Well, let's see if she shows.
Excuse me.
Is there a problem?
Do you know a Zack Blumenthal?
Yeah, I know him.
If you're looking for him, he hasn't shown up yet.
Well, I'm sorry, but Zack's dead.
What?
Oh, my god.
What do you mean, Zack's dead?
His body was found yesterday morning off one of the trails.
Did he crash?
What happened?
We're still trying to figure that out.
And we're hoping to talk to whoever saw him last.
He was here for yesterday's ride.
We all saw him.
Anyone see him leave?
Yeah, I saw him leave.
He went after Bella.
Is she here?
No, haven't seen her today.
Is this Bella?
- Yes.
- Yeah, that's her.
Bella Turner.
What was Zack's relationship with Bella?
I don't think he had one.
Nobody does with her.
What do you mean?
She's nice, but she... kind of keeps to herself.
She likes to ride more than she likes to hang out.
She never hangs out.
Any reason why Zack would have a bunch of pictures of her at his house?
Yeah, I think he's in love with her.
She never paid any attention to him.
You know where she lives?
No.
I mean, she never really talks.
She's a real pedal masher.
Nobody knows where she lives, only where she works.
City Bikes on Ankeny?
I'm gonna need to get you guys' names.
Will, what do you got?
Prelim tox report from the M.E.
Anything in Zach's medical records about lethal allergies?
No, Zack Blumenthal was killed by a toxin that caused acute systolic heart failure.
Basically, this guy's heart broke.
However, this toxin doesn't really exist.
And by "doesn't really exist," you mean what?
It's most closely related to Phyllobates terribilis, a frog from the Colombian jungles, but not exactly.
It's a batrachotoxin, which is only found in three poisonous frogs from Colombia and three poisonous birds from Papua New Guinea.
And I'm not even gonna try to pronounce the name of said frogs and birds.
And let me just add one ounce of this poison kills 10,000 mice, 10 to 20 humans, and 2 African bull elephants.
How do I know this?
I looked it up.
So where did the poison that killed Zack come from?
I think it's got to be Wesen.
How did the M.E. explain it?
She couldn't.
All right, we got a name for the woman in the photos.
It's Bella Turner.
Got it.
I'll run a background.
Why hasn't Viktor called?
Is he still alive?
You shouldn't worry about Viktor anymore.
Well, you're awfully loyal.
I'm loyal to the family, not to any particular member.
Am I a member of that family?
Your child is.
I thought that's why we came here.
Is anybody doing anything about finding her?
Believe me, the family knows how important she is.
The king is doing everything he can to...
Excuse me.
Yes?
When?
No.
We'll be ready.
Ready for what?
Take care of this.
You might want to change into something more appropriate.
Why?
Well, I wouldn't want to meet Prince Kenneth in a robe.
Prince Kenneth?
Do you know him?
By reputation.
Well, what's he like?
Results.
If Zack went after Bella, caught up with her, are we thinking she's a witness to what happened or involved?
Might be either.
What's the motive?
They supposedly had no relationship.
Maybe Zack thought they did.
All right, before we go in, are we thinking Bella's Wesen?
Well, could be.
If she is, we don't know what we're dealing with.
Only way we'll know is if I get her to woge.
If she is, let me know?
If I pull my gun, that'll be a good indication.
I'm calling for Bella Turner.
Bella Turner.
Yeah.
You know Zack Blumenthal?
Yeah, we're in the same cycling club.
Why?
Well, his body was found yesterday off of one of the biking trails.
Oh, my god.
Zack's dead?
What happened?
We were hoping you could help us figure that out.
Me?
We talked to some of your cycling club.
They said Zack followed you.
We were wondering if you saw him again after yesterday's ride.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, he caught up to me on the trail.
Did you two talk?
A little.
What about?
Look, um,
Zack was interested in going out, and I wasn't, so I told him, and, you know, just got on my bike and left.
That was the last I saw him.
So you two weren't having a relationship.
No.
But he wanted to.
Yes, and I told him I wasn't interested.
How did he respond to that?
Was he upset?
I don't know!
Maybe, a little.
But that's not my fault.
Look, Zack didn't do anything, okay?
I just left.
Did he take his helmet off?
What?
When you were with him on the trail, did he take his helmet off?
Yeah, I guess.
We found his helmet and his bicycle on the trail and his body in the ravine.
So you had to have been with him at the same place that he died.
Come on, Bella.
You were with him.
Have you ever heard of batrachotoxin?
No.
It's a poison that stops the heart and makes you look like this.
What does this have to do with me?
How would I even do something like that?
You're free to check my gear.
If you guys think I have whatever that poison is, then go ahead.
Take a look.
That's my bike right there.
Well, that won't be necessary.
If you think of anything, give us a call.
She didn't woge.
Nope.
Well, she seemed pretty upset.
Is she Wesen or not?
Well, if she is, she's good at hiding it.
If she is, we better find out what kind of Wesen we're dealing with.
Excuse me.
Aren't you supposed to knock before entering?
- He's here.
- In the hotel?
Closer.
Okay, well, just...
Kenneth, may I present Adalind Schade?
I...
So you're the Hexenbiest mother of the child everyone's so obsessed with.
Yes.
I'm here for one reason, and that's to get your child back to the family.
I understand you made contact with Mr. Burkhardt's girlfriend.
Juliette.
I did.
And how did that go?
Nick is a Grimm again.
I was told you took care of that.
I did, but he figured out a way to undo it.
That's possible?
I didn't think so.
But it does explain why Juliette is now a Hexenbiest.
I want that bitch dead.
Any other surprises for me?
Oh.
You're full of surprises.
Whose child is this?
Viktor's.
If it's secreting batrachotoxins through its skin, then touching is deadly.
And you're saying she didn't woge.
No.
See, I was thinking it was a Peau de la Mort, but those rascals, you sneeze and they woge.
I think you're dealing with Folterseele.
What is that?
Well, they're kind of classically tragic.
Always beautiful, always deadly.
Really?
You think a Folterseele.
They're kind of rare, thank God, and they don't woge like any other Wesen.
Then how do they woge?
Well, it's not an emotional response.
It's more of a physical sexual one.
So, like, when they're aroused?
It's not them; it's whoever's turned on by them.
It's a defense mechanism.
Yeah, an extremely offensive defense mechanism.
Well, no wonder they're rare.
That sounds like the old Frog Prince story.
Yeah, but you kiss this frog, your face blows up and you die.
Wait, let me see if I can get this straight.
The only way you can get a Folterseele to woge is if you're sexually attracted to her?
Yeah, basically.
So we can't tie her to the crime and we can't make her woge.
Interrogation room's not gonna work on this one.
Unless you guys get in there and one of you is, like, totally into her, and then...
Really?
Well, why not?
So we can't make the arrest 'cause we don't have any evidence, and I won't know if she's a Folterseele 'cause I can't get her to woge.
Look, if you are dealing with the Folterseele, she's not doing this on purpose.
She's probably trying to avoid it.
A lot of men can't control themselves around the female Folterseele.
Well, that's probably why she keeps to herself.
Exactly.
So many you guys need to just let this one go, you know, let the sleeping Folterseele lie.
It could happen again.
What if we, I don't know, neutralize what's happening to her, like of like we did with that toad-eating lawyer?
Is that possible?
Won't know till we try.
Try.
Okay, I'll let you know what I find out.
Have you told Viktor the blessed news?
Not yet.
Uh...
I was about to.
Right.
Well, I'm sure he'll be thrilled.
Damerov is here, sir.
Bring him in.
Hopefully, he has good news about the whereabouts of your... other child.
You were expecting Prince Viktor?
Yes.
He's been recalled.
I'm Kenneth.
I've heard a lot about you, Sam.
Have you found Kelly Burkhardt or Adalind's child?
Not yet, but I've made progress.
Progress?
Is that what's in the briefcase?
Yes.
We know that she sold the truck in Spokane.
We believe she's still in the area with the child.
You know, the problem with being a double agent, Sam, is that you never really know where your loyalties lie.
I work for the family, sir.
Not anymore.
I'm a little more hands on than Viktor, who, I'm sorry to say, is sterile.
So you might want to rethink who the father is.
Hey, Bella.
Sorry, Ricky, we're closing.
I didn't come about my bike.
You heard about Zack?
I can't believe it.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
Thanks.
You know, Zack was pretty stupid about you.
What are you talking about?
You're telling me you didn't know he was in love with you.
Look, I just want to be left alone, okay?
But he was never good enough for you, was he?
You got to go.
I got to lock up.
It's too bad about Zack.
He was always watching your back.
And such a nice back.
Get out.
You're a stuck up bitch who thinks she's too good for anybody.
Ricky, what are you doing?
Zack was an okay guy, and now he's dead, and I think it's because of you, so I came to get what you never gave him.
No, no, no!
You don't know what's gonna happen.
Yeah, I do.
What the hell?
What are you?
911.
What's your emergency?
Hurry!
If you don't get here fast...
He's dying, and I don't know what to do!
Juliette, where the hell are you?
Just answer your damn phone.
Nick?
Juliette.
I need to get some of my stuff.
What, so you're just...
moving out.
I was hoping you wouldn't be home.
Look, can we talk about this?
There's really nothing you or anybody else can say or do.
This is who I am.
Juliette, this is my fault, and if there's anything
I could do to change it, I would.
I know that.
I haven't given up yet.
Why not?
Because I love you.
That's...
That's great.
That's really great.
Juliette...
Answer it.
Come on, Nick.
There's a lot of big, scary Wesen on the loose in Portland.
That's what you're good at.
Go get 'em, Grimm.
Hank.
Where?
This is Rick Thornton, one of the guys from the cycling club.
Wouldn't be able to tell from looking at him.
Who called 911?
Came from the shop phone, woman's voice.
No identity was given.
Call ended eight seconds after it was made.
We think that was Bella?
That's what I'm thinking.
You run a background on her?
I did.
She was clean.
Not even a traffic ticket.
Anyone else on the premises?
No, not when we got here.
Shop was unlocked.
Alarm had not been set.
We contacted the owner.
He was at home.
Got here about five minutes ago.
All right, let's talk to him.
What time did you close up tonight?
I didn't.
I left early.
Bella stayed late.
She was supposed to close up.
Those are her keys on the floor over there.
Is that guy really dead?
I'm afraid so.
Bella's not back there, is she?
No.
I tried to get a hold of her as soon as I heard.
She's... she's not answering.
I'm really worried about her.
Do you have Bella's home address?
Yeah, yeah,
I got it on my phone.
Bella, it's the police.
We need you to open up.
Bella.
Clear.
Bedroom clear.
I got some photos.
That's a nasty scar.
Looks like some kind of burn.
Could that be her mother?
I think we ought to find out.
It's about time.
How'd it go?
I gave them the information.
Did they replace Viktor?
They did.
Prince Kenneth is now in charge.
Kenneth.
I know of him.
I just don't know much about his branch of the family.
We shouldn't underestimate him.
I got the impression he doesn't have much patience.
He wants Kelly Burkhardt and the child.
I'm gonna need to deliver something real soon.
Well, I'll come up with something.
No, we can't keep stalling.
If he finds out I'm working for you...
I'm dead.
I'm not sure we should even be talking about this on the phone.
Well, then come to my office.
No, it's too dangerous now.
I don't trust them.
And they probably don't trust me.
All right, then where?
I told them I was going back to Spokane tonight.
Meet me at the...
Willamette paper mill.
At 9:00.
You got to have something I can give them by then.
It's my life on the line here.
Don't screw with me.
You'll regret it.
Bravo.
I think we're good here.
Got something interesting here on Bella's mom.
Police report from 1989.
Cindy Turner was victim of a rape.
That's her?
No scarring.
Well, the picture was taken 24 years ago.
Same night she was attacked.
"Suspect William Ashford
"attacked victim Cindy Turner outside Spackle's Bar and Grill but died at the scene."
No charges filed against Turner.
All right, well, let's find out how he died.
Whoa.
That looks familiar.
He died the same way our vics died.
And Bella and her mom have got to be the same.
Ashford's death was ruled accidental.
Cause of death:
severe allergic reaction to something unknown.
Rosalee.
I think we've got something that might work, but no guarantees.
It's never been tried.
What I think we have to do is depolarize her membranes by either using a tetrodotoxin or a saxitoxin, both of which should have antagonistic effects to the poison she secretes.
This would allow us to block her from creating the poison in the first place.
Any side effects?
Yeah, these are some hardcore toxins we're dealing with here.
I can't imagine there wouldn't be...
And probably not very good ones.
But it's better than her being out there killing people.
It's not as if she has a choice here.
Do it.
Got to go.
Got a DMV on Bella's mom, Cindy Turner.
The address on her license is in Gresham.
Let's go.
Bella?
I saw your bike.
What are you doing here?
Mom.
What's wrong, honey?
It happened again, but it wasn't my fault.
He attacked me, and I told him to leave me alone.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's not okay, Mom.
The police are gonna think that I did it.
It doesn't matter what the police think.
I can't go back there.
You don't have to.
Look, I'm gonna go back to the house, get you something to eat.
You just rest, hmm?
I'll take care of everything.
No.
No, you don't!
What happened?
Nothing.
Don't lie to me.
It's not her fault, Mom.
It doesn't matter.
It has to be done.
No.
It's for her own good.
I will not do this to my daughter.
You won't have to.
I will.
Hey, forget knocking.
There's a woman on the floor.
She's not moving.
She's got blood in the back of her head.
All right, she's got a pulse.
I'm calling an ambulance.
Bella.
It's okay.
Police.
You don't understand.
My mother's with her.
Do you want to keep on killing?
No!
Do you want to be raped like your mother and me?
No!
You have to do what we all have to do.
It's for your own good.
Police!
No.
No!
Thank God.
You think you saved her?
Oh, you haven't saved her from anything.
Well, maybe we have.
You need to come with us.
It's not her fault.
You can't arrest her.
We know.
There might be another way.
If you drink this, we believe it will keep your touch from killing anyone.
And you're sure it'll work?
No.
It's never been tried.
Of if it has been, there's no record.
Usually, that means not such a good outcome.
It may affect you in ways we have no way of predicting.
Not exactly, um, FDA approved, you know?
Look.
I know a thing or two about side effects.
You really want to think about this.
You don't know what it's like to never be able to experience love.
Never feel the touch of another person or be able to touch them.
I don't care about the side effects.
It can't be worse than what happens now.
Sam.
Sam?
Sean Renard.
We haven't met.
I'm Kenneth.
Did you kill him?
I did.
But he sort of had it coming, trying to trick the family into believing he knew where Kelly Burkhardt and the child were.
Well, I should arrest you.
Well, my confession is just between the two of us.
The king is extremely annoyed with how things have progressed.
He desperately wants his granddaughter.
And I've been tasked with the responsibility of making that happen.
There's no need for guns.
Nobody's going to shoot anybody.
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.
So... this is when you tell me how important I am to the family and that we should join forces.
No.
Going there, are we?
Oh!
This is where I tell you how important I am to the family.
And unless you join forces with me, you'll end up like your friend Damerov.
And the king will mourn the loss of another son.

Let's talk about your next foundation challenge, which takes us back to some of the best science fiction shows of the '60s and '70s, including Lost in Space, Buck Rogers, and of course,
Star Trek.
Now the backdrops behind me are inspired by the painted landscapes commonly seen on shows of this era, so for this foundation challenge, you'll choose one, and use it as inspiration for a retro alien like you might have seen on one of these series.
- [pleased murmurs]
- That's awesome!
(Evan voice-over) This sounds like it's gonna be a blast, retro aliens.
They're so silly, but they're iconic.
Now we'll need a guest to judge, and I just so happen to know someone more qualified than anyone else in the world.
He spent 18 years working on Star Trek The Next Generation,
Deep Space Nine, Voyager, Enterprise, and four of the franchise's feature films.
Please give a warm welcome to your mentor, and my dad, Michael Westmore.
[cheers and applause]
(Ricky voice-over) Papa Westmore!
Who knows aliens better than Mr. Westmore?
Nobody, that's who.
So what sort of advice can you give these guys to help them channel that retro, campy vibe?
(Michael) In television, in the '60s, they didn't have time to do a lot of appliance work, so on Star Trek, they used patterns, they used stencils, anything that could speed up the time in application.
So, be imaginative, but paint in broad strokes.
All right, guys, it's time to pick your backdrops to inspire your aliens.
Jordan, you get first pick.
All right, the winner of this foundation challenge will earn immunity in this week's spotlight challenge.
After being on the bottom for the last two challenges, immunity would be such a boost to just get myself where I need to be.
On my go, I want you to grab a workstation and a model, and get started.
You have two hours for this challenge.
(both) Go!
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hey!
All right, this is our landscape.
[mouths words]
I'm going to try to recreate some of the mountain forms in the landscape
Kind of make them part of your anatomy.
Such a fan of the old retro science fiction,
Star Trek, and of course, Mr. Westmore.
You're geeking out right now.
I am!
I have the orange sun background, and my alien travels through the galaxy to bring about peace.
I'm using Kryolan's Tuplast, which is a liquid plastic, to create dots, just as extra eye candy.
Dries so quick, it's drying on the tube.
My character is going to be a space bandit.
I found a forehead piece that'll read "alien but still humanistic,"
almost like a lot of the Star Trek aliens were.
I chose the purple and green background.
I'm adding some oranges to complement and pink patternings to put a little more contrast into it.
(Jasmine voice-over) My retro alien is humanoid android, and I want to incorporate the glacier-like peaks from my backdrop.
I find these oversized playing cards, and I cut them up and airbrush them...
It's just geometric shapes, that I'm gonna give on to your face.
And they stick beautifully to the skin.
Awesome.
(Evan voice-over) For this challenge,
I want to do a beauty makeup, because I haven't really done one.
I'm thinking Avatarian space mistress.
I find this stencil that looks like the background of the mountains.
I decide I'm going to stencil this down her face.
Spacy!
[rock music]
♪ ♪
(Ben voice-over) The cracked earth pattern in my landscape inspired me to use this hexagon stencil, as just another design element.
But I don't really like it.
It's really busy.
At this point I'm pretty sure that I'm not going to win immunity.
At least I can wash my hands of the makeup and move forward.
10 minutes, guys.
- You got 10 minutes left.
- Yeeks!
Oh, God!
[electronic music]
♪ ♪
That's it, guys!
Time's up, brushes down!
Whoo!
(man) Oh, man.
Thank you.
Hey, Jordan.
Tell us about your retro alien.
She's kind of a sassy space bandit.
I think you coordinated her well, from head to toe, and the way you applied your appliance, very well done.
I could see you out with Kirk.
Cool. [Laughs]
I went with the idea of
"the person who runs the bar, runs the town."
Someone the captain might have to really deal with.
(Michael) I like these and what you did with them.
It does stand out.
I think the shading could've been a little bit more subtle.
Okay.
He actually kind of had Kirk-like hair, so I went with a doppelganger from a simian universe.
There's so much character that's going on in the face, but I would've liked to have seen it with no design, because you've used such an intricate type of face.
So this is my space mistress.
I like the way the mountains look in the background...
- Oh, yeah.
- So I kind of used that for the stenciling.
I like that you stepped out and did a whole color number, and it's a nice, clean application.
Thank you.
- Stevie, how are you?
- Hi!
(Stevie voice-over) Once I look around the room, it's awesome to see how amazing everyone's makeups are.
I don't know if I have a shot at immunity, but I'm happy with the way he came out.
All right, Dad, so who created your favorite makeups today?
One of my favorites is Evan.
You created a total package from head to toe, in a very clean manner.
- Thank you.
- And Jordan,
You tied green and orange together well and it's something we would have actually seen in that era.
Okay, Dad, who is the winner of this challenge?
The winner is...
Evan.
Thank you.
(Michael) Your makeup is so clean, it's ready to go on camera right now.
- Thank you.
- Evan, congratulations.
As the winner of today's foundation challenge, you have earned immunity, and cannot be eliminated in this week's final challenge.
Sweet.
Thank you very much.
(Evan voice-over) To hear Mr. Westmore, the master of sci-fi makeup, say that mine was the best is an awesome feeling.
All right, are you ready to hear about your next spotlight challenge?
(all) Yeah!
Movie makeups have come a long way, evolving with every generation.
And one of the most obvious ways to see that evolution is with the Klingons in Star Trek.
And we're lucky enough to have three of the people with us today who've been responsible for those Klingons... one of them standing right here next to me... but two of our judges have also worked on Star Trek films.
Ve and Neville?
Come on out, guys.
- [cheers and applause]
- Welcome, guys.
Thanks for being here!
So Ve was involved in creating the Klingons in Star Trek, The Motion Picture.
My dad designed Worf and the Klingons for Star Trek The Next Generation, and then Neville evolved them into their current iteration in JJ Abram's Star Trek Into Darkness.
Now this evolution of the Klingons is very relevant to what you'll be doing this week, because your spotlight challenge is to take the retro aliens you just made for the foundation challenge, and evolve their design into a more modern aesthetic
that you might see in one of today's sci-fi film franchises.
- Oh, my God.
- This is cool, right?
It's so cool.
We get to do a reboot.
I am so excited.
(Ben voice-over) Oh, my God.
I didn't like the makeup that I did.
Had I known that this was going to be something else,
I would've made a lot of different choices.
Okay, so what advice do you have for these guys?
(Neville) Along with design, suspension of disbelief is also evolving.
Audiences are much more savvy than ever before, so I suggest really turning up the volume on the realism.
All right, these guys will be coming around to consult with each of you while you're working on your designs.
Having their input is going to be incredibly beneficial to our concepts.
You will all be using the same models from the foundation challenge, so go ahead and get started on your designs.
Good luck, guys.
Hello!
I'm actually pretty excited that I don't have to stop working on the character.
I feel like there's a lot of potential for improvement.
- Hi, Meg.
- Hi.
So how are you going to translate the first makeup into the future?
- I want her to be more badass...
- Okay.
So instead of veins, I'm going to give her dreads of, like, hair.
Great.
And painting?
I definitely want to carry the color through to the hands.
I would go up the whole body, to tie it all together.
- Yeah, definitely.
- Good.
I wanted to repeat some of these plateaus.
- Mm-hmm.
- But now that I have more time,
I want to get more creative with some forms.
I love the shape, but you have to have justification as to the shapes that you're gonna create.
This could be a utility for digging, but whatever it is, it's gotta be purposeful.
Okay.
I put these pieces on him, but since this is very mechanical of a texture,
I'd like to make it more organic.
- Uh huh.
- And then,
I'd love to bring his brow back just a little farther.
Make sure that you have a hairdo that's gonna come down and cover the brow piece.
You don't want to have it just glued on top of his hair.
I had a lot of trouble with the foundation challenge, really, justifying a lot of things,
- Mm-hmm.
- Taking shapes similar to the environment and transposing onto him.
Be careful with that, 'cause we, as humans, don't look like dirt, so when you start making it look like the planet surface, it could feel forced.
Most artists would want a chance to redo their makeup, and this is it, but I feel like I have to polish a turd.
It's just hard to get motivated over a makeup that I hate.
I'm worried because, for the first time,
I'm stuck.
It's a tough one to make work.
(Ben voice-over) I'm worried because, for the first time, I'm stuck.
I feel like I have to polish a turd.
(Neville) Looking at the photograph for inspiration, that's good to do, but I wouldn't make that a rule for yourself, that this has to be like its planet because it's been on it for so long.
- Okay.
- And it might free you up.
Absolutely.
(Ben voice-over) Talking to Neville helps me to see that there's a lot of possibilities if I don't go too literal with it.
So, let's see how shiny this turd can get.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
I really like all these shapes in the nose.
I'm thinking of incorporating those wrinkles all over.
Be careful when you get around in here.
We've seen a lot of this lately, when it gets really wide and kind of crazy-looking?
- Yeah.
- Might really help, too, just to get more height in his head?
Okay.
I'm going to take what I did with the hair, and actually make it into something that's more of an icicle look?
(Michael) Okay.
And forehead-wise, are you going to be changing structure in here?
- I kind of want to keep this.
- This is a design.
You want to make it more like skull structure underneath.
- Oh, absolutely.
- Good luck!
- Thank you very much.
- You've got some work to do.
Yeah, I do.
I think it would be really cool if I integrated some of the paint work that I did on her arms and on her face into the sculpture and actually make it three-dimensional, so I'm going to try and sculpt that into the forehead piece,
and then I'll fabricate for the rest of the body.
(Scott voice-over) The new inspiration for my character is this is an underground race, that live in underground water collectives.
So I want to give her an aquatic look.
I'm going to eliminate the nose, and give a little bit more of a projection in profile that's going to make her look much more feminine and beautiful.
[rock music]
One of the things that I noticed from my first makeup is her silhouette in profile, so I immediately think I want to do this cowl that slopes up.
The stencil that I used looked like vents, so I'm actually going to sculpt the pattern in.
There's going to be this line of these vents that follow it, and I think that's a really cool idea.
♪ ♪
(Jason voice-over) While I want to keep her very similar, these little horns that I had, I want there to be more of them, and the more spikes, the longer they are.
It reads into not only their age, but also their class system.
That's great.
Yeah, I'm trying not to look at this too much.
- That's probably a good idea.
- Yeah.
(Ben voice-over) The day started out rocky, but now, I'm looking at it as an opportunity.
This green business that I did didn't make any sense, so I think it would be really cool to design that as a membrane that has evolved to filter out greenhouse gasses.
And then I also can use a sheet of plastic and a metal rake, and it allows me to get a large number of these pores in a single stroke.

I know exactly what I want the outcome to look like,
Mm-hmm.
I'm with you.

I know that I want to take these 2D paper elements and turn them 3D.
I feel good about that, but I don't know what to sculpt on his face.
Oh, I give up right now.
I'm overwhelmed.
30 minutes, everyone!
I just want to punch clay right now.
That's time, everybody!
I have my face piece started, but I really need to get this in a good place.

I'm ready to start bulking out my cowl.
I want to take the styled hair that I did from my original design, and turn it into a cowl piece with an asymmetrical, icicle-y, tentacle look.
In my head, I really like how it looks, so I'm going for it.
I decided with my face piece that I'm not changing things too much, but I'm adding a little bit more clay to his lips, and I still need to do a cowl.
I'm thinking, "All right, I'll stick with it."
I really do like it.
I mean, once it's on the cowl, it's gonna look awesome.
[electronic music]
Hi, everybody.
[all calling out greetings]
I have a big surprise for you.
(all) Oh...
I have a very dear friend that's with me today.
He's been a big influence in the Star Trek world.
He was an actor, director.
I have with me Commander Riker, Jonathan Frakes.
- Jonathan!
- What?
Stop!
[applause]
- Yay!
- Yay!
(Scott voice-over) It's one thing to go to a Star Trek convention.
It's another thing when they're coming to your table to give advice.
That's a lot for a sci-fi nerd to digest.
Hello, Scott.
Hi, Mr. Frakes.
(both) Nice to meet you.
- How are you?
- Very, very huge honor.
- Sorry, Mr. Westmore.
- You a Trekker?
Little bit.
[laughs]
(Michael) So tell us.
I went through quite an evolution, bringing it into the next generation.
Oh, you were dying to say that!
- This is what you've drawn?
- So this is our same character.
- Yes.
- That's fabulous.
But those look like glam lips, instead of, like, alien lips.
Yeah, I would go in with, like, something on the brown side.
That's what I was going to say.
Something at the darkest end of this palette.
(Michael) You're on the way.
- Good luck.
- Great to meet you.
(Scott voice-over) Getting Jonathan Frakes' input was a dream come true for me.
- This is beautiful sculpting.
- Interesting.
(Michael) If we were still shooting Star Trek,
I'd take this.
- I would take this one.
- I'd take this with me.
Well, that's an honor.
I'm glad to hear that.
This was Jason's original makeup, the other day.
She's beautiful and creepy.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
(Jonathan) Is this going to be a challenge, 'cause they're two separate pieces?
(Michael) It's a challenge, but it can be done.
- Good luck.
- Yeah. [Laughs]
This was Stevie's makeup the other day.
I took that concept and put it into my sculpt, having this very organic lines going back.
I think you've gotta go something here to extend this.
(Michael) Oh, definitely.
I'm glad you haven't run this yet.
This is not good.
What really bothers me is your cute little nose.
(Jonathan) Doesn't feel like it goes with this face.
It just feels as if the wrinkles have been stretched off the nose in a way that has left us with this very pretty, feminine type nose.
There's a lot of little changes that they want.
Now I'd have to redo all of this detail, so I've basically thrown out like three or four hours of work.
I'm so frustrated.
I'm glad you haven't run this yet.
(Stevie voice-over) I have a lot of changes to do.
I've basically thrown out like three or four hours of work.
(Michael) Do away with those nostrils.
You could even take this cute little tip here, and add some clay.
Ooh, yeah, that always helps the alien look.
You weren't planning on sleeping, right?
[laughs] I can do it.
I'm nervous, but I know all these adjustments will be beneficial to me.
Is this your face over here?
Yeah, this is my face.
You've already sculpted that up?
So this is the stencil.
Now I sculpted it in.
I'm just going to continue it in this cowl.
I'm actually sculpting those in, and those are going to be the vent holes.
Oh, so these are vents, these slices here.
- Yeah.
- These are very hard to see.
You'll never be that close, if you're back here shooting it.
You want to make sure it's intentionally a vent.
I've radically changed my character.
So this is an older, more evolved version of him.
Maybe do a little something more in the neck, here, to take away from this total humanoid look, here.
So this was my original character.
The idea was that these are membranes, so this is my new design to accent that.
I like the membrane idea.
What do you think about extending the head out a little bit?
Because this feels like a hat.
- Little bit more mask.
- That's what I'm saying.
- You like that idea?
- Very much.
I wish you all luck.
I'm very impressed.
- Thank you!
- Thank you, bye!

You were the best and the worst this week.
The rest of you are safe and can head back to the makeup room.
All right, the judges would like to speak with each of you to learn more about your work.
So Stevie, you're up first.
I'd like to hear the story of this character's transition.
Well, in the foundation challenge, I used mechanical tubing pieces, so I wanted to transform them into a more organic skin texture.
It's gorgeous.
It's one of the best paint jobs in terms of the technique of the application that I've ever seen on this show.
Thank you.
I think you've done a really amazing job in a lot of areas.
The sculptural forms feel alien and authentic.
It is pretty fantastic.
It's a beautiful makeup job.
I'm also very happy that you brought the makeup down in the neck area, that was a good choice.
Thank you.
Stevie, please step back.
Scott, please step forward.
So I gotta hear the story.
How did that become this?
Her planet is fairly arid.
It's been destroyed by war.
But she is actually in an underground water cavern.
That was where the fish look came from.
This is a stunning makeup job.
The treatment on the chest and the color combination is amazing.
Thank you, Ve.
There's so many things you've done with this
I think are exquisite.
The sculptural definition around the cheekbones is so beautiful and symmetrical.
You've got a really good eye, my friend.
Thank you.
Scott, you can step back.
Jasmine, please come forward.
Tell us about your concept, please.
Originally, I did these cut outs.
I wanted to take those and give them more of a 3-D effect and carry that throughout the rest of his head.
The fundamental forms of the sculpture are flawed.
I think the mistake is all in the design of the sculpt, really.
There's certain artistic rules.
You can bend them, but they cannot be ignored.
From the top of his head to just before it gets to his nose,
I love, and then the nose and the lip... it kind of goes away for me.
Jasmine, could you please head back.
Thanks.
Ben, you're up.
Tell us about how you arrived at this guy.
(Ben) This humanoid has evolved to adapt stuff like this.

You're welcome.
You're given him fantastic bone structure.
I love the fact that his head isn't perfectly bald.
It's got a lot of texture and you've got your membrane going on.
- Nice makeup job.
- Thank you so much.
Very successful this week.
The skin texture feels real.
This feels like makeups that we're seeing now on the big screen.
- Great work, man.
- Thank you very much.
Ben, you can step back.
[laughing]
Jason, please step up.
Please tell us about the transition of your character.
The original prosthetics that I used were small spirals coming off of her face.
I wanted to make a point for them, so I actually had them growing out.
They denote age and also help with the class definition.
There's a massive collaboration of technical errors.
Unfortunately, I think it is an absolutely catastrophic sculptural fail, in that her upper lip is so far out over her lower lip.
You put a bald cap on her and lifted that wig up, so now you have this big, gaping mess back there.
I'm pleased with what you've achieved going from your previous design to this.
Have you achieved the level that it needs to be... that's a different story.
Jason, you can step down.
Jordan, you're up.
[mimics gun shots]
Would you please tell us about your concept?
I tried to take a lot of the detailing that was in the paint work and make it sculptural in the forehead.
I'm really disappointed, I was really expecting something very cool.
At least before what you had on her body was also on her face.
None of this goes together now.
You're supposed to be doing a makeup, not building armor pieces.
The uniform has its merits, if you have the time, but we lose so much of the eyes.
This should be your foundation, and that should be the transition.
Just because you did great armor last week that helped you succeed, that is death on this show and in your professional career.
To take something that worked last week and go,
"I'm just gonna keep repeating that and that'll get me somewhere..." It will not.
Jordan, could you please head back.
All right, could you please head back to the makeup room while the judges deliberate.
All right, judges, so let's talk about the looks that worked for you tonight.
Why don't we start with Stevie?
(Ve) That was by the far the best painting that we have on the set today.
- Amazing technical skill.
- Yeah.
That was one of my favorites.
All right, let's move on to Scott.
(Neville) The sculpture is gorgeous.
Just the precision on the chest piece, the face were pretty incredible.
He painted her whole body.
It's a beautiful makeup, no doubt about it, but I'm not sure that it's what we asked him to do in this challenge.
All right, judges, let's move on to Ben.
(Glenn) I love the sculpture.
It's a technically very sound makeup.
(Ve) Yeah, it was really well done.
He still had those green stripes, but now they made sense, they were membranes.
This makeup feels like it is a today design.
(Michael) He accentuated the face in a very slight way, and I love that.
Okay judges, why don't we move on to the makeups that didn't quite work so well this week.
Let's start with Jasmine.
(Neville) I think it's terrible in regard to its form language.
That's a big concern for me.
It was like she got down to the nose and went,
"I...
I don't have any," you know?
Right.
Just like, "What do I do now?"
All right, let's move on to Jason.
(Ve) He was so unsuccessful in everything he did.
There was no beauty makeup with that buck tooth with the red lipstick that just made it worse.
When you bring someone's face out like that and create an overbite, it becomes cartoon-y.
All right, let's move on to Jordan.
(Ve) It was exactly the same thing, only he just took the wig off and used her blond hair.
(Michael) There seemed to be more thought going into the original than into this makeup.
If you can't fulfill the challenges as they're set forth, you're not gonna get very far here.
All right, so judges, have you made your decisions?
Yeah.
All right, well Michael, thank you so much for joining us tonight.
Thank you very much, and hopefully I can join you guys again.
- We hope so.
- That would be awesome.
- Oh, yeah.
- We hope so.
Thank you.
All right, let's bring them back out.
All right, Glenn, tell us about the top looks.
Stevie, you did such a fantastic job with both your sculptural forms and an exquisite paint job.
Scott, the beauty and the symmetry that you were able to maintain throughout your entire character is beyond impressive.
Ben, you gave us a very believable, minimal makeup.
It definitely felt like something that we might see today on the big screen.
So who's the winner of this challenge?
The winner of tonight's challenge is...
So who is the winner of this challenge?
The winner of tonight's challenge is...
Ben.
You gave us a very convincing transformation and a realistic character.
- Great job.
- Thank you guys very much.
Starting this challenge at the lowest point yet for me, to be the winner of the challenge just blew my mind, and it means a lot.
- Ben, congratulations.
- Thank you.
You, Stevie, and Scott are all safe and can head back to the makeup room.
- Thank you guys.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- Good job, guys.
All right, guys.
That means one of you will be going home tonight.
Please step forward.
Glenn, tell us about the bottom looks.
Jasmine, on the plus side, we did see a taste of your original character, but there was some unfortunate forms that ruined the appeal of your makeup.
Jason, the evolution of your makeup was pretty strong, but up close, there were a myriad of technical errors and poor aesthetic choices.
Jordan, the head to toe character was successful, but the evolution component was nearly absent in your final creation.
So who is going home tonight?
The person going home tonight is...
Jason.
Despite the fact that you improved on your original makeup, there were just too many things wrong for us to overlook.
That's fine.
Jason, I am so sorry, but you have been eliminated.
That means Jordan and Jasmine, you are safe this week and can head back to the makeup room.
Thank you.
Jason, you're an intelligent guy, you make great decisions, and it's such a shame to see you go based on some technical stuff.
'Cause you've got it, and I hope to see what you've got in the future.
Thank you so much for this opportunity.
Jason, it's been so great having you here with us.
Could you please head back to the makeup room and pack up your kit.
(both) Good luck.
Leaving on a look where I can see the problems sort of takes the sting out of it a little bit.
- It's me.
- Oh, Jason.
I know that inside of me, there's the ability to really create amazing things.
You're the best.
I made a good choice in following this weird career path.
And I'm not gonna quit any time soon.

MAN:
Dispatch called me at my house.
It was after hours.
They told me that a young kid had found what they thought was a torso.
No head.
No arms.
No legs.
Just, just the torso.
_
MAN:
What's this area here?
This is Channel View here... and it was right down here... in this corner, was where the torso was at.
- Right here?
- Right here.
This is probably the one time
I can honestly say that I've actually reached down somebody's throat.
Because in order to get the torso out,
I had to take my hand down the throat and put my fingers around the breastbone, and then pull him up out of the water.
- Is that with your hand?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
How else am I going to get him out?
JONES:
And then we started our kind of a general survey of the rest of the area.
In doing so, that's when we found a bunch of the black plastic trash bags that were floating in the water.
Well, trying to figure out what we had inside the bags, we simply palpated the bags.
We just felt them.
We had what felt like arms and hands, fingers.
A leg, where you could feel the knee, the ankle, and the actual foot itself... and one of the bags containing the legs, there was like small holes that had gotten torn into the bag where we could actually look in,
and I recall seeing a toe.
MAN:
Dismemberment started with the right leg and went to the left leg, to the left arm, to the neck, and then to the right arm.
The right arm, being the last, was cut but it was only sawn halfway through, and then it apparently broke, either by stepping on it or something, to break the bone.
Getting tired, running out of time...
Whatever it was.
MAN:
I'd never had a dismembered headless torso to investigate.
You know, I've investigated my fair share of shootings, homicides...
A whole array of investigations...
Thousands!
But I never had one of these.
So, I knew it was going to be interesting.
I had no idea of what I was fixin' to step into.
If I had of, I'm, I'm not so sure
I would have stepped in so willingly.

MAN:
A teenage boy fishing in the shallow waters off Galveston, Texas, stumbled on the gruesome remains of a murder.
SECOND MAN:
Pretty much everything had washed up, with the exception of the head.
That was the focus of several days of searching.
That's the only body part that was never recovered.
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
One of the most important things that we found initially was a newspaper.
We were able to read an address of 2213 Avenue K.
And the blood that we found on the stair rail, it actually started kind of a trail that came right out here.
And it went in right out to the, to the road.
JONES:
We found out who owned the building.
It was a guy by the name of Klaus Dillman.
Was able to ascertain that the tenant downstairs was an older man named Morris Black that lived in Apartment Number 1.
And then Apartment Number 2, he said, was rented by a little old lady named Dorothy Ciner, who was a mute female.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
We were able to roll one of the fingerprints from the hand that was in the trash bag.
From that, we were able to identify the victim as Morris Black.
[Camera shutter clicks]
BENNETT:
It appeared that in the common hallway, someone had wiped up blood which led into Apartment 2, which helped me to gain a search warrant into Apartment 2.
JONES:
What we observed then was a pretty pristine apartment.
Very neat.
What was unusual was on the floor of the kitchen were drop cloths.
Once we got the drop cloths pulled up from the floor, we found some real small cuts.
What I wound up doing was to actually take and cut that entire area out.
That's when I found a bloodstain.
We were actually able to match the blood back to Morris Black, so we knew that that's the location where he had been dismembered.
CAZALAS:
When we first talked to the landlord, he said,
"Well, there's a lady that rents Apartment Number 2, but she's never there because she travels all the time."
And I'm thinking to myself...
"Well, if she's got the money to travel all the time,
"and she's gone for months on end, what's she doing living in this dump?"
_
_
_
_
_
_
Ha!
In fact, it was kind of described as a real ugly deaf mute woman.
[Chuckles]
CAZALAS:
There was very little personal items in the apartment.
There was nothing to suggest a woman lived there.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
CAZALAS:
Red flags started coming up.
A mute female that travels a lot.
But a guy will be coming around every now and then.
Well, I'm thinking, "Well, there's no Dorothy Ciner,
"that's just a cover.
This guy is renting this place for whatever reason."
[Birds cooing]
JONES:
The next step was to go through the trash can in the alley behind the house.
Every piece of trash was taken out, photographed, labeled, catalogued.
_
_
JONES:
It was an appointment receipt, and on that contained information that gave us a date and time in which some eyeglasses were to be picked up.
CAZALAS:
Now I'm thinking, "Who's Robert Durst?"
Still a bunch of question marks.
I take the receipt to the eye clinic.
Ask them if they know who Robert Durst is.
The lady up front said, "Yeah, he was supposed to pick those glasses up on Friday."
I'm thinking, "Vegas wouldn't touch these odds this guy's going to show up."
But I said, "If he shows up, here's my card.
Here's my pager number." And I left.
JONES:
In the trash bags, we also found a price tag from Chalmers Hardware, which was two blocks away from where Morris Black lived.
BENNETT:
Among the things that were bought from Chalmers were a 4-inch paring knife and drop cloths with the Chalmers tags on it.
CAZALAS:
Also bought at Chalmers was a bow saw.
Lo and behold, my pager goes off.
And I'm like...
and I recognized that number.
But I, I haven't, in my mind I didn't connect the dots yet.
And then they had put in "911." I'm thinking, "Who is that?"
Then, bam!
"That's the eye clinic."
I jump in my car and I'm coming up 21st Street.
And he pulls out of the alleyway parking lot right in front of me, and pulls up to the red light, and I'm right behind him.
[Siren wailing]
CAZALAS:
Our Motor Division pulls him over, and we detain him.
JONES:
I recall pulling up to that, and I walked up and glanced down through the back windshield.
And the first thing I saw was a bow saw.
Kind of got that grin.
Saying, "Yeah, we got him."
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Camera shutter clicks]
BURROWS:
Initial impressions when I saw him being brought in was like, "Really?
This guy?
Did that?
Didn't fit."
[Camera shutter clicks]
CAZALAS:
God, the guy looks like a librarian!
He doesn't look like a person that would dismember a human being.
I explained to him he'd been arrested for, you know, homicide.
"Your bond has been set at $250,000."
And he asked me, he said, "Well, what should I do?"
And I said, "I don't know.
Do you have $250,000?"
And he just calmly looked at me and he goes, "Well, not on me."
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
Who the hell is this guy to give you that type of an answer?
Which is not the type of answer you would normally hear.
CAZALAS:
I get a call from the desk sergeant at the jail.
He goes, "Cody, this Durst guy,
"he made a phone call to somebody named
"Debrah in New York.
"Told them he was in Galveston, Texas,
"under arrest for murder, and he needed $250,000.
And she said, "No problem, it will be there in the morning."
And I'm thinking, "What's going on here?"
[Buzzer]
MAN:
Are you the wife of Robert Durst?
Yes.
When did you marry him?
_
December 2000.
Would that have been December 11, 2000?
- Yes.
- OK.
When did you first hear that Mr. Durst had rented an apartment in Galveston, Texas?
Um, I heard that he rented an apartment in Galveston, Texas certainly after October 9, 2001.
OK.
And why are you so definite about that date?
Because that was the day he called me, after he was arrested.
And I never even heard of Galveston, Texas.
When he called you, where was he calling from?
Jail.
How long was it from the time that he was arrested until he got out of jail on bail?
- 24 hours.
- OK.
When he got out, where did he go?
[Laughs] I'm in New York.
He's in Galveston.
He probably went to the bail bondsman's office first.
And then he probably went home.
Do I know?
Was I there?
I wasn't there.
CAZALAS:
I'm back at work the next morning about 7:30.
I get to my office.
Usually on my phone there may be one or two messages.
I get to, I get my cup of coffee,
I sit down, my light's blinking.
21 messages.
That's when the information about who Robert Durst really was started coming into play.
_
We get this tip that a Bob Durst has been arrested in Galveston and he's murdered his, his neighbor or something.
And it was like, "Holy shit!
Can this be our Bob Durst?"
The fact that Morris Black had been murdered in Galveston was not something that would have garnered any attention at our end.
It was only when they made the connection to Robert Durst.
_
CAZALAS:
You find out that he belongs to one of the richest families in New York City.
But that's not strange enough, the guy's also suspected in his wife's disappearance in New York.
_
MAN:
Robert Durst first made headlines after he reported his wife missing in 1982.
And to this day, the case remains unsolved.
_
The family of Kathleen Durst, from the beginning, had said they believed Robert Durst was responsible.
He had always maintained his innocence.
Family sources tell News Channel 4
Robert Durst relocated to Galveston, Texas, but they were unsure what he was doing there.
WOMAN:
How many office buildings does the Durst Organization currently own?
Nine.
And can you tell me what those office buildings are?
655 Third Avenue, 675 Third Avenue, 205 East 42nd Street, 733 Avenue of the Americas,
825 Avenue of the Americas, Four Times Square, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, 1155 Avenue of the Americas, and 114 West 47th Street.
_
_
_
Most defendants charged with murder show up at their arraignment, OK?
Did I expect him to be there?
Of course I did.
I wanted to eyeball this guy.
I wanted to size him up.
CAZALAS:
Robert was due to be in court at 10:00 a.m.
And he was a no-show.
He decided to run.
_
In the search for Robert Durst, a lawyer is asking him to surrender.
Attorney Michael Kennedy made an appeal to him to turn himself in.
KENNEDY:
Robert, if you see this or hear this, please come home.
You have loved ones who care about you here in New York.
Your family is solidly, unifiedly behind you.
The Trust has the wherewithal to pay for your legal defense.
WOMAN:
The press reported that you had hired a bodyguard to protect yourself against Robert Durst.
Is that true?
- That is true, yes.
- MAN:
Objection.
WOMAN:
Did you believe your life was threatened by Robert Durst?
At that point in time...
Robert's actions were bizarre, and while I wasn't sure,
I felt that, to protect my family was a reasonable action to take.
WOMAN:
And when did you hire the, the bodyguard?
In, uh, after Robert jumped bail in Texas.
JONES:
All the wheels started turning.
How do we find this guy?
Everything from state and local agency notifications to notifications to Interpol.
There's no telling where this guy could have gone.
MAN:
A private investigator told a Galveston newspaper that Durst has used false names in the past.
He had disguised himself as a woman.
His alias, Dorothy Ciner, is even listed on the FBI's 10 most wanted list.
CAZALAS:
Dorothy Ciner was somebody he went to
Scarsdale High School with.
_
We found a bank account that he had set up as Emilio Vignoni.
He had rented a car from a place in Mobile, Alabama, saying he was Morris Black.
And we know there were probably more.
He's not crazy.
He's diabolical.
BAGLI:
When Bob didn't show up at his hearing and we realize he's on the run,
I was as curious as anyone else about where he was.
And so, I was calling places where he had lived.
_
"When Robert A. Durst returned to
"South Salem in Westchester County,
"a neighbor noticed him seemingly lost in thought
"on a dock at Lake Truesdale,
"behind the tree-shrouded stone cottage he once shared with his wife Kathleen."
"It was his birthday and their wedding anniversary,
"though she had vanished 19 years earlier.
"The State Police and the Westchester District Attorney
"had been seeking him for a year
"to go over his account of his last night with his wife...
"The night she vanished.
"Mr. Durst's reverie on the dock
"suddenly ended when a neighbor strolled down to the lakefront."
That neighbor, of course, was the woman that moved into the house that Bob had lived in, and that Kathie had disappeared from.
It was always piecing together these shreds of information.
It was hazy, but it began to tell a story about this guy who, of course, was an enigma.
WOMAN: 58-year-old Robert Durst was arrested here at Wegmans Grocery Store in Hanover Township after allegedly trying to steal a hoagie.
JONES:
I think we were kind of in the same boat as everybody else that had any knowledge of this case whatsoever.
How in the hell could he have been that stupid?
MAN:
He just kind of got cold look.
All the color ran out of his face, and he just stared at me, and he said, "I'm not saying another word until I speak to an attorney."
MAN:
Police searched his rental car outside...
[Camera shutter clicks]
MAN:
And found two loaded guns, [Camera shutter clicks] some marijuana, [Camera shutter clicks]
$38,000 in cash, and an I.D. for one "Morris Black."
BAGLI:
Why would a guy with $520 in his pocket and $37,000 in the trunk walk into a Wegmans and steal a sandwich?
The guy is crying out to be arrested, isn't he?
On the other hand, he's also a guy that sort of walks through life and thinks he can do whatever he wants to do.
And most of the time, he could.
WOMAN:
In shackles and under heavy guard, 58-year-old Robert Durst is led into the courtroom.
SECOND WOMAN:
Mr. Durst, are you going to fight extradition?
MAN:
He has no comment at this time.
Are you competent to stand trial?
He has no comment.
WOMAN:
Where is your wife?
MAN:
How long was he in jail in Pennsylvania?
DEBRAH:
About two months.
Did you speak to him while he was in jail?
Sure.
Did you call him?
It doesn't work that way.
OK.
He called you from jail in Pennsylvania?
- Yes.
- OK.
During that time, did he call you regularly?
Yes.
And in any of those conversations, did he indicate what his plans were in the future?
Since I'm sure that you know that those conversations were taped, and they probably are public, you could read for yourself, because I don't really remember what conversations we had.
_
DURST ON TAPE:
It's very cold in this prison.
DEBRAH ON TAPE:
Yeah, cold out.
DURST:
Well, it's cold out, but I feel like it's cold in this prison.
I'm sitting here all covered with a sweatshirt.
Some guys were quote unquote "in paper."
DEBRAH:
I know that.
You told me.
Honey, now when you're now sitting in your room, do you wear that thing or not?
DURST:
Sometimes I do.
Sometimes I don't.
It's very warm.
It is comfy.
I never wore a jumpsuit until I got here.
It's a very comfy thing.
It's easy to take on and off.
Right now, I'm out here in the thing and I have it on o-o-over my l-l-long johns.
And a sweatshirt.
And it's still cold.
MAN:
The time now is approximately 10:34 a.m.
We're on record.
WOMAN:
I'm going to swear you in, sir, if you raise your right hand, please.
Do you solemnly swear or affirm the testimony you are about to give to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Yes, ma'am.
MAN:
Will you state your full name for the record, please?
Robert Durst.
Am I correct that from the 1970s until 1994, you worked in the Durst Family business?
Sort of, yes.
What were your positions there?
- My titles?
- Yes.
I had various important-sounding titles, but I didn't really go there very much.
WOMAN:
Can you tell me under what circumstances
Robert left the Durst Organization in the mid Nineties?
At some point, Robert stopped showing up for, stopped showing up to the office.
And did you ever make any inquiries why he stopped showing up at the office?
I, I did, yes.
And what did you find out?
At that time, he would not talk to me.
MAN:
Did you quit the family business in 1994 after Douglas Durst was picked to run the family businesses?
Well, he was pretty much picked in 1989-90, I remember.
Who picked him?
Uh, the senior generation...
Seymour Durst, David Durst, Roy Durst.
And Seymour Durst was your father?
Yes.
MAN:
In fact, Mr. Durst, you've threatened to kill your brother, haven't you?
- No, sir.
- OK.
DEBRAH:
He screwed you out of everything.
Your birthright.
The entire Durst Organization.
And you forgot?
DURST:
Right.
He took over the family business.
No doubt about it.
DEBRAH:
OK.
He took it from you.
He could have done it with you.
There were a lot of choices he could have done, but no.
He took it from you and his plan was to destroy you and embarrass you.
And he did it.
MAN:
Quote, "The level of enmity is so great that Douglas Durst
"even went so far as to hire a bodyguard to protect himself from Robert Durst."
Close quote.
Do you remember that allegation?
DURST:
I remember that that occurred.
Do you know why Douglas Durst hired a bodyguard?
Because he's a pussy.
Did he hire the bodyguard because he was scared of you?
I have knowledge that he'd hired a bodyguard.
Why he would be scared of me, I have no idea.
MAN:
New York real estate heir Robert Durst will be turned over to Texas authorities this week.
He faces charges in the dismemberment murder of a 71-year-old neighbor.
Yesterday in Pennsylvania, the 58-year-old waived his right to contest his extradition to Texas.
WOMAN ON RECORDING:
It's going to be a media circus there.
DURST ON RECORDING:
I know it is.
I'm trying not to think about it, and I'm trying not to, to plan, what kind of look I should have on my face.
- WOMAN:
I know.
- DURST:
Am I supposed to be smiling?
Or am I supposed to be grim?
WOMAN:
If you're thinking of expression,
I would just have like as close to no expression as you can possibly have...
DURST:
Yeah.
That's what I keep... _
The defendant in this case was one who's wanted for a serious crime... murder...
in the state of Texas.
There was a nationwide manhunt for this individual, and it's thanks to the Pennsylvania authorities that he was picked up, arrested, and kept here.
And so we thank the D.A. Morganelli for this.
And with respect to the New York case and in response to your question, let me just say that the disappearance of Kathleen Durst 20 years ago is a case that we are actively investigating.
We continue to seek the public's cooperation.
And as time goes on, we're finding that more and more people are cooperating with us.
And we will get to the bottom of what happened to Kathleen Durst, one way or the other.
DURST ON RECORDING:
Now Jeanine Pirro can go to the grand jury and say, "This person is going to be tried for murder in Galveston."
That's going to make it much more likely that they're going to want to indict me for Kathie.
DEBRAH ON RECORDING:
Bob, she hasn't arrested you because she doesn't have anything.
You're going to be all right.
I promise.
- DURST:
OK.
- DEBRAH:
All right.
You got to chin up.
You'll be OK.
- DURST:
Thank you.
- DEBRAH:
I love you, honey.
DURST:
I love you.
- DEBRAH:
Bye.
- DURST:
Bye.
Have your investigators been able to talk to Robert Durst?
No, they have not.
He's represented by an attorney.
As D.A. Morganelli has said, it's the attorneys that we speak to.
MAN:
Do you have any comment on what happened today with your client?
Well, it's very straightforward.
Mr. Durst is anxious to get to Texas to defend himself on the charges pending there.
He has a viable defense, and he wants to raise it.
Therefore, he chose to voluntarily waive extradition and not seek to fight extradition.
And we expect that he'll be moved forthwith to Texas where, with two of my colleagues down there, we'll begin further to prepare his defense.
And that defense would be an insanity defense?
No.
I'm not going to comment on the defense.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
MAN:
Did you at any time tell Mr. Durst that you'd divorce him if he retained Michael Kennedy?
Yes.
Why did you say that to him?
Because I didn't trust Michael Kennedy.
I didn't like Michael Kennedy.

MAN:
I'm quoting again from the tapes.
Do you recall your wife threatening
"I won't stand by you anymore," close quote, if Michael Kennedy wasn't fired as your lawyer?
Yes.
Michael Kennedy was the one who was hired by Douglas to represent me.
And I had no intention of hiring Michael Kennedy anyway.
WOMAN:
Robert Durst returned to Texas tonight.
The heir to a Manhattan skyscraper fortune is charged with murdering and dismembering his Galveston neighbor.
Well, I'm Dick DeGuerin.
I've been practicing law since 1965.
_
Almost all of that time in criminal law.
Either as a prosecutor, where I started, or as a criminal defense lawyer once I saw the light.

MAN:
And then she says, "I will fight for what I want and I will fight you hard," close quote.
[Chuckles] Well, that's Debbie.
MAN:
Do you remember that conversation?
I don't remember that one specifically, but the big argument then was that I wanted to hire
Dick DeGuerin to represent me, and she wanted me to hire Mike Ramsey.
Durst couldn't decide between Ramsey and me, so, he hired both of us.

MAN:
All Good Things, a new feature film, premiered at the SVA Cinema in Chelsea.
The film was inspired by one of the most notorious missing persons cases in New York City history.
MAN:
Andrew, what brought you to this film?
Well, I'm always interested in, interested in these sort of monster stories.
You know, you find out that somebody is described as a maniac or a crazy person or a, a serial killer, and I always think that those people started out somewhere.
You know, they started out as people, and they had hopes and dreams.
He was an unusual person.
So, he did unusual things.
Stranger than fiction, in a lot of ways.
I remember this case because it's based on one of the great murder mysteries.
There was a man named Robert Durst who came from a very wealthy real estate family.
He married a beautiful woman named Kathie.
Played by you, and then in 1982, khht, she was gone.
Nobody has ever found the body.
He was never charged with the murder.
He's still alive.
I remember saying to my partner,
"I would like to make a movie
"that Robert Durst himself could
"sit and watch, and have an emotional reaction to."
A call comes through.
And I pick it up.
And a sort of smaller voice on the line says, "Hello.
I-I-Is this Eamonn Bowles?"
So I said, "Yes."
He goes, "Oh, this is Bob Durst."
[Laughs] My blood froze.
I went like, "Um, oh, hello, excuse me.
Who is this?
I thought this was someone else.
Who's calling?"
And he's like, "This is Bob Durst.
I'm looking for Andrew Jarecki." And I'm like, "Oh!"
[Telephone ringing]
DURST ON RECORDING:
Hello?
JARECKI ON RECORDING:
Hi.
Mr. Durst?
DURST:
Hi, Mr. Jarecki.
How are you?
JARECKI:
I'm good.
How are you?
DURST:
Good.
I just saw the movie.
So, I h-h-have an idea.
I've no idea if it makes any sense.
But, but you're the one to talk to about it.
- JARECKI:
Sure.
- DURST:
Would it make sense for as in some capacity there to be an interview with me related to what's in the movie?
JARECKI:
Yeah, I think that's a fascinating idea.
I'll be in touch soon.
I'm glad that we had a chance to talk.
DURST:
All righty.
Bye-bye.
JARECKI:
Nice to talk to you.
[Hangs up]
[Telephone ringing]
DURST ON RECORDING:
Mr. Jarecki.
- JARECKI ON RECORDING:
How are you?
- DURST:
Good.
How are you?
JARECKI:
Good.
I think you should feel free to call me "Andrew," by the way.
DURST:
Andrew, how are you?
I have over the years been approached by all the various interview shows.
And I'm not interested in doing a "True Crime" kind of stuff.
JARECKI:
Right.
DURST:
You know more about Robert Durst than any of those people do.
JARECKI:
I guess the question is, you know, has anybody really done a piece on you where they didn't walk into it with a very strong assumption?
One possibility is to have me interview you after having made this film.
DURST:
I would tend to cooperate with you with whatever it was you're going to do.
You, you've got all my phone numbers.
I look forward to hearing from you.
JARECKI:
Sounds good.
Talk to you soon.
DURST:
Bye-bye.
[Static]
DeGUERIN:
As a criminal defense lawyer, you don't always get the truth.
I'm not naive enough to think that you do.
But you try to make a judgment of whether you're getting the truth.
CAZALAS:
When you only have a murderer's word for what happened, why believe anything that comes out of the man's mouth?
DeGUERIN:
What I need to say to you is that I believe Bob, and I believed him from the very beginning.
CAZALAS:
I don't think Bob Durst is the kind of man that kills for the thrill of the kill.
I don't think he takes any particular pleasure in killing.
But if you back him in a corner, if you threaten his freedom, he'll kill ya.
Dispatch called me at my house.
It was after hours.
They told me that a young kid had found what they thought was a torso.
No head.
No arms.
No legs.
Just, just the torso.
What's this area here?
This is Channel View here... and it was right down here... in this corner, was where the torso was at.
- Right here?
- Right here.
This is probably the one time
I can honestly say that I've actually reached down somebody's throat.
Because in order to get the torso out,
I had to take my hand down the throat and put my fingers around the breastbone, and then pull him up out of the water.
- Is that with your hand?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
How else am I going to get him out?
And then we started our kind of a general survey of the rest of the area.
In doing so, that's when we found a bunch of the black plastic trash bags that were floating in the water.
Well, trying to figure out what we had inside the bags, we simply palpated the bags.
We just felt them.
We had what felt like arms and hands, fingers.
A leg, where you could feel the knee, the ankle, and the actual foot itself... and one of the bags containing the legs, there was like small holes that had gotten torn into the bag where we could actually look in,
and I recall seeing a toe.
Dismemberment started with the right leg and went to the left leg, to the left arm, to the neck, and then to the right arm.
The right arm, being the last, was cut but it was only sawn halfway through, and then it apparently broke, either by stepping on it or something, to break the bone.
Getting tired, running out of time...
Whatever it was.
I'd never had a dismembered headless torso to investigate.
You know, I've investigated my fair share of shootings, homicides...
A whole array of investigations...
Thousands!
But I never had one of these.
So, I knew it was going to be interesting.
I had no idea of what I was fixin' to step into.
If I had of, I'm, I'm not so sure
I would have stepped in so willingly.
A teenage boy fishing in the shallow waters off Galveston, Texas, stumbled on the gruesome remains of a murder.
Pretty much everything had washed up, with the exception of the head.
That was the focus of several days of searching.
That's the only body part that was never recovered.
One of the most important things that we found initially was a newspaper.
We were able to read an address of 2213 Avenue K.
And the blood that we found on the stair rail, it actually started kind of a trail that came right out here.
And it went in right out to the, to the road.
We found out who owned the building.
It was a guy by the name of Klaus Dillman.
Was able to ascertain that the tenant downstairs was an older man named Morris Black that lived in Apartment Number 1.
And then Apartment Number 2, he said, was rented by a little old lady named Dorothy Ciner, who was a mute female.
Mr. Dillman, did I understand you to say that you were pleased with Mrs. Ciner as a tenant?
Very much so.
One, you didn't see her very much, and that's one good criteria of a tenant, as you say?
Yes.
That's what I would consider a good criteria.
Ms. Ciner is paying you in advance for the rent?
She wanted to pay me for a whole year.
We were able to roll one of the fingerprints from the hand that was in the trash bag.
From that, we were able to identify the victim as Morris Black.
It appeared that in the common hallway, someone had wiped up blood which led into Apartment 2, which helped me to gain a search warrant into Apartment 2.
What we observed then was a pretty pristine apartment.
Very neat.
What was unusual was on the floor of the kitchen were drop cloths.
Once we got the drop cloths pulled up from the floor, we found some real small cuts.
What I wound up doing was to actually take and cut that entire area out.
That's when I found a bloodstain.
We were actually able to match the blood back to Morris Black, so we knew that that's the location where he had been dismembered.
When we first talked to the landlord, he said,
"Well, there's a lady that rents Apartment Number 2, but she's never there because she travels all the time."
And I'm thinking to myself...
"Well, if she's got the money to travel all the time,
"and she's gone for months on end, what's she doing living in this dump?"
Did you think that Mrs. Ciner was attractive?
If you're asking me, was it in general terms being an attractive woman,
I would say looked like a middle-aged woman with a flat bust.
Wouldn't be my type.
Ha!
In fact, it was kind of described as a real ugly deaf mute woman.
There was very little personal items in the apartment.
There was nothing to suggest a woman lived there.
But you did see a man who you believed to be Dorothy Ciner's brother-in-law a couple of times, didn't you?
On the porch from far.
We never stand close together.
I mean eye contact, or anything like this.
It was always from a distance.
Red flags started coming up.
A mute female that travels a lot.
But a guy will be coming around every now and then.
Well, I'm thinking, "Well, there's no Dorothy Ciner,
"that's just a cover.
This guy is renting this place for whatever reason."
The next step was to go through the trash can in the alley behind the house.
Every piece of trash was taken out, photographed, labeled, catalogued.
What was the first piece of evidence where you poked your partner... and you said, "Ah, we just found something."
It was an appointment receipt, and on that contained information that gave us a date and time in which some eyeglasses were to be picked up.
Now I'm thinking, "Who's Robert Durst?"
Still a bunch of question marks.
I take the receipt to the eye clinic.
Ask them if they know who Robert Durst is.
The lady up front said, "Yeah, he was supposed to pick those glasses up on Friday."
I'm thinking, "Vegas wouldn't touch these odds this guy's going to show up."
But I said, "If he shows up, here's my card.
Here's my pager number." And I left.
In the trash bags, we also found a price tag from Chalmers Hardware, which was two blocks away from where Morris Black lived.
Among the things that were bought from Chalmers were a 4-inch paring knife and drop cloths with the Chalmers tags on it.
Also bought at Chalmers was a bow saw.
Lo and behold, my pager goes off.
And I'm like...
and I recognized that number.
But I, I haven't, in my mind I didn't connect the dots yet.
And then they had put in "911." I'm thinking, "Who is that?"
Then, bam!
"That's the eye clinic."
I jump in my car and I'm coming up 21st Street.
And he pulls out of the alleyway parking lot right in front of me, and pulls up to the red light, and I'm right behind him.
Our Motor Division pulls him over, and we detain him.
I recall pulling up to that, and I walked up and glanced down through the back windshield.
And the first thing I saw was a bow saw.
Kind of got that grin.
Saying, "Yeah, we got him."
Initial impressions when I saw him being brought in was like, "Really?
This guy?
Did that?
Didn't fit."
God, the guy looks like a librarian!
He doesn't look like a person that would dismember a human being.
I explained to him he'd been arrested for, you know, homicide.
"Your bond has been set at $250,000."
And he asked me, he said, "Well, what should I do?"
And I said, "I don't know.
Do you have $250,000?"
And he just calmly looked at me and he goes, "Well, not on me."
Who the hell is this guy to give you that type of an answer?
Which is not the type of answer you would normally hear.
I get a call from the desk sergeant at the jail.
He goes, "Cody, this Durst guy,
"he made a phone call to somebody named
"Debrah in New York.
"Told them he was in Galveston, Texas,
"under arrest for murder, and he needed $250,000.
And she said, "No problem, it will be there in the morning."
And I'm thinking, "What's going on here?"
Are you the wife of Robert Durst?
Yes.
When did you marry him?
December 2000.
Would that have been December 11, 2000?
- Yes.
- OK.
When did you first hear that Mr. Durst had rented an apartment in Galveston, Texas?
Um, I heard that he rented an apartment in Galveston, Texas certainly after October 9, 2001.
OK.
And why are you so definite about that date?
Because that was the day he called me, after he was arrested.
And I never even heard of Galveston, Texas.
When he called you, where was he calling from?
Jail.
How long was it from the time that he was arrested until he got out of jail on bail?
- 24 hours.
- OK.
When he got out, where did he go?
I'm in New York.
He's in Galveston.
He probably went to the bail bondsman's office first.
And then he probably went home.
Do I know?
Was I there?
I wasn't there.
I'm back at work the next morning about 7:30.
I get to my office.
Usually on my phone there may be one or two messages.
I get to, I get my cup of coffee,
I sit down, my light's blinking.
21 messages.
That's when the information about who Robert Durst really was started coming into play.
We get this tip that a Bob Durst has been arrested in Galveston and he's murdered his, his neighbor or something.
And it was like, "Holy shit!
Can this be our Bob Durst?"
The fact that Morris Black had been murdered in Galveston was not something that would have garnered any attention at our end.
It was only when they made the connection to Robert Durst.
You find out that he belongs to one of the richest families in New York City.
But that's not strange enough, the guy's also suspected in his wife's disappearance in New York.
Robert Durst first made headlines after he reported his wife missing in 1982.
And to this day, the case remains unsolved.
The family of Kathleen Durst, from the beginning, had said they believed Robert Durst was responsible.
He had always maintained his innocence.
Family sources tell News Channel 4
Robert Durst relocated to Galveston, Texas, but they were unsure what he was doing there.
How many office buildings does the Durst Organization currently own?
Nine.
And can you tell me what those office buildings are?
655 Third Avenue, 675 Third Avenue, 205 East 42nd Street, 733 Avenue of the Americas,
825 Avenue of the Americas, Four Times Square, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, 1155 Avenue of the Americas, and 114 West 47th Street.
But you went there around the time of his arraignment.
Did you expect him to be there?
Most defendants charged with murder show up at their arraignment, OK?
Did I expect him to be there?
Of course I did.
I wanted to eyeball this guy.
I wanted to size him up.
Robert was due to be in court at 10:00 a.m.
And he was a no-show.
He decided to run.
In the search for Robert Durst, a lawyer is asking him to surrender.
Attorney Michael Kennedy made an appeal to him to turn himself in.
Robert, if you see this or hear this, please come home.
You have loved ones who care about you here in New York.
Your family is solidly, unifiedly behind you.
The Trust has the wherewithal to pay for your legal defense.
The press reported that you had hired a bodyguard to protect yourself against Robert Durst.
Is that true?
- That is true, yes.
- Objection.
Did you believe your life was threatened by Robert Durst?
At that point in time...
Robert's actions were bizarre, and while I wasn't sure,
I felt that, to protect my family was a reasonable action to take.
And when did you hire the, the bodyguard?
In, uh, after Robert jumped bail in Texas.
All the wheels started turning.
How do we find this guy?
Everything from state and local agency notifications to notifications to Interpol.
There's no telling where this guy could have gone.
A private investigator told a Galveston newspaper that Durst has used false names in the past.
He had disguised himself as a woman.
His alias, Dorothy Ciner, is even listed on the FBI's 10 most wanted list.
Dorothy Ciner was somebody he went to
Scarsdale High School with.
We found a bank account that he had set up as Emilio Vignoni.
He had rented a car from a place in Mobile, Alabama, saying he was Morris Black.
And we know there were probably more.
He's not crazy.
He's diabolical.
When Bob didn't show up at his hearing and we realize he's on the run,
I was as curious as anyone else about where he was.
And so, I was calling places where he had lived.
"When Robert A. Durst returned to
"South Salem in Westchester County,
"a neighbor noticed him seemingly lost in thought
"on a dock at Lake Truesdale,
"behind the tree-shrouded stone cottage he once shared with his wife Kathleen."
"It was his birthday and their wedding anniversary,
"though she had vanished 19 years earlier.
"The State Police and the Westchester District Attorney
"had been seeking him for a year
"to go over his account of his last night with his wife...
"The night she vanished.
"Mr. Durst's reverie on the dock
"suddenly ended when a neighbor strolled down to the lakefront."
That neighbor, of course, was the woman that moved into the house that Bob had lived in, and that Kathie had disappeared from.
It was always piecing together these shreds of information.
It was hazy, but it began to tell a story about this guy who, of course, was an enigma.
58-year-old Robert Durst was arrested here at Wegmans Grocery Store in Hanover Township after allegedly trying to steal a hoagie.
I think we were kind of in the same boat as everybody else that had any knowledge of this case whatsoever.
How in the hell could he have been that stupid?
He just kind of got cold look.
All the color ran out of his face, and he just stared at me, and he said, "I'm not saying another word until I speak to an attorney."
Police searched his rental car outside...
And found two loaded guns, some marijuana,
$38,000 in cash, and an I.D. for one "Morris Black."
Why would a guy with $520 in his pocket and $37,000 in the trunk walk into a Wegmans and steal a sandwich?
The guy is crying out to be arrested, isn't he?
On the other hand, he's also a guy that sort of walks through life and thinks he can do whatever he wants to do.
And most of the time, he could.
In shackles and under heavy guard, 58-year-old Robert Durst is led into the courtroom.
Mr. Durst, are you going to fight extradition?
He has no comment at this time.
Are you competent to stand trial?
He has no comment.
Where is your wife?
How long was he in jail in Pennsylvania?
About two months.
Did you speak to him while he was in jail?
Sure.
Did you call him?
It doesn't work that way.
OK.
He called you from jail in Pennsylvania?
- Yes.
- OK.
During that time, did he call you regularly?
Yes.
And in any of those conversations, did he indicate what his plans were in the future?
Since I'm sure that you know that those conversations were taped, and they probably are public, you could read for yourself, because I don't really remember what conversations we had.
It's very cold in this prison.
Yeah, cold out.
Well, it's cold out, but I feel like it's cold in this prison.
I'm sitting here all covered with a sweatshirt.
Some guys were quote unquote "in paper."
I know that.
You told me.
Honey, now when you're now sitting in your room, do you wear that thing or not?
Sometimes I do.
Sometimes I don't.
It's very warm.
It is comfy.
I never wore a jumpsuit until I got here.
It's a very comfy thing.
It's easy to take on and off.
Right now, I'm out here in the thing and I have it on o-o-over my l-l-long johns.
And a sweatshirt.
And it's still cold.
The time now is approximately 10:34 a.m.
We're on record.
I'm going to swear you in, sir, if you raise your right hand, please.
Do you solemnly swear or affirm the testimony you are about to give to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Yes, ma'am.
Will you state your full name for the record, please?
Robert Durst.
Am I correct that from the 1970s until 1994, you worked in the Durst Family business?
Sort of, yes.
What were your positions there?
- My titles?
- Yes.
I had various important-sounding titles, but I didn't really go there very much.
Can you tell me under what circumstances
Robert left the Durst Organization in the mid Nineties?
At some point, Robert stopped showing up for, stopped showing up to the office.
And did you ever make any inquiries why he stopped showing up at the office?
I, I did, yes.
And what did you find out?
At that time, he would not talk to me.
Did you quit the family business in 1994 after Douglas Durst was picked to run the family businesses?
Well, he was pretty much picked in 1989-90, I remember.
Who picked him?
Uh, the senior generation...
Seymour Durst, David Durst, Roy Durst.
And Seymour Durst was your father?
Yes.
In fact, Mr. Durst, you've threatened to kill your brother, haven't you?
- No, sir.
- OK.
He screwed you out of everything.
Your birthright.
The entire Durst Organization.
And you forgot?
Right.
He took over the family business.
No doubt about it.
OK.
He took it from you.
He could have done it with you.
There were a lot of choices he could have done, but no.
He took it from you and his plan was to destroy you and embarrass you.
And he did it.
Quote, "The level of enmity is so great that Douglas Durst
"even went so far as to hire a bodyguard to protect himself from Robert Durst."
Close quote.
Do you remember that allegation?
I remember that that occurred.
Do you know why Douglas Durst hired a bodyguard?
Because he's a pussy.
Did he hire the bodyguard because he was scared of you?
I have knowledge that he'd hired a bodyguard.
Why he would be scared of me, I have no idea.
New York real estate heir Robert Durst will be turned over to Texas authorities this week.
He faces charges in the dismemberment murder of a 71-year-old neighbor.
Yesterday in Pennsylvania, the 58-year-old waived his right to contest his extradition to Texas.
It's going to be a media circus there.
I know it is.
I'm trying not to think about it, and I'm trying not to, to plan, what kind of look I should have on my face.
- I know.
- Am I supposed to be smiling?
Or am I supposed to be grim?
If you're thinking of expression,
I would just have like as close to no expression as you can possibly have...
Yeah.
That's what I keep...
Bobby, did you kill Kathie 20 years ago?
The defendant in this case was one who's wanted for a serious crime... murder...
in the state of Texas.
There was a nationwide manhunt for this individual, and it's thanks to the Pennsylvania authorities that he was picked up, arrested, and kept here.
And so we thank the D.A. Morganelli for this.
And with respect to the New York case and in response to your question, let me just say that the disappearance of Kathleen Durst 20 years ago is a case that we are actively investigating.
We continue to seek the public's cooperation.
And as time goes on, we're finding that more and more people are cooperating with us.
And we will get to the bottom of what happened to Kathleen Durst, one way or the other.
Now Jeanine Pirro can go to the grand jury and say, "This person is going to be tried for murder in Galveston."
That's going to make it much more likely that they're going to want to indict me for Kathie.
Bob, she hasn't arrested you because she doesn't have anything.
You're going to be all right.
I promise.
- OK.
- All right.
You got to chin up.
You'll be OK.
- Thank you.
- I love you, honey.
I love you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Have your investigators been able to talk to Robert Durst?
No, they have not.
He's represented by an attorney.
As D.A. Morganelli has said, it's the attorneys that we speak to.
Do you have any comment on what happened today with your client?
Well, it's very straightforward.
Mr. Durst is anxious to get to Texas to defend himself on the charges pending there.
He has a viable defense, and he wants to raise it.
Therefore, he chose to voluntarily waive extradition and not seek to fight extradition.
And we expect that he'll be moved forthwith to Texas where, with two of my colleagues down there, we'll begin further to prepare his defense.
And that defense would be an insanity defense?
No.
I'm not going to comment on the defense.
I have to tell you something.
I have a real problem.
You keep going deeper and deeper and deeper into Kennedy and I hate him!
And I don't think you get it.
I will give him...
Everything that comes from Kennedy is a cancer!
And you don't get it!
And I'm not going to stand here and watch this...
I can't handle it.
Did you at any time tell Mr. Durst that you'd divorce him if he retained Michael Kennedy?
Yes.
Why did you say that to him?
Because I didn't trust Michael Kennedy.
I didn't like Michael Kennedy.
Michael Kennedy's allegiance is to Douglas.
You must understand that.
First he was going to say you are incompetent.
Then he was going to say you are insane.
That would mean, okay, that your decisions, like giving me a power of attorney... if you were incompetent at the time, so that it's not good.
And wait, let me finish, no interrupt.
What he doesn't want is me to get any of the trust money later on.
Since I'm not your wife, because you were incompetent at the time... ok, means that they are the only ones who can make your decisions.
So they would take all of your money, and they would become the guardians of it.
It's too risky.
I'm quoting again from the tapes.
Do you recall your wife threatening
"I won't stand by you anymore," close quote, if Michael Kennedy wasn't fired as your lawyer?
Yes.
Michael Kennedy was the one who was hired by Douglas to represent me.
And I had no intention of hiring Michael Kennedy anyway.
Robert Durst returned to Texas tonight.
The heir to a Manhattan skyscraper fortune is charged with murdering and dismembering his Galveston neighbor.
Well, I'm Dick DeGuerin.
I've been practicing law since 1965.
Almost all of that time in criminal law.
Either as a prosecutor, where I started, or as a criminal defense lawyer once I saw the light.
DeGuerin is the top Texas guy.
No, he's not.
Ramsey is.
Well, now wait a minute.
DeGuerin is not, wait a minute.
And then she says, "I will fight for what I want and I will fight you hard," close quote.
Well, that's Debbie.
Do you remember that conversation?
I don't remember that one specifically, but the big argument then was that I wanted to hire
Dick DeGuerin to represent me, and she wanted me to hire Mike Ramsey.
Durst couldn't decide between Ramsey and me, so, he hired both of us.
In addition to the six hundred for each of DeGuerin and Ramsey, another three hundred.
Okay.
So that'll be $1,500,000, plus this three hundred is $1,800,000.
And God, I hope it gets me acquitted.
All Good Things, a new feature film, premiered at the SVA Cinema in Chelsea.
The film was inspired by one of the most notorious missing persons cases in New York City history.
Andrew, what brought you to this film?
Well, I'm always interested in, interested in these sort of monster stories.
You know, you find out that somebody is described as a maniac or a crazy person or a, a serial killer, and I always think that those people started out somewhere.
You know, they started out as people, and they had hopes and dreams.
He was an unusual person.
So, he did unusual things.
Stranger than fiction, in a lot of ways.
I remember this case because it's based on one of the great murder mysteries.
There was a man named Robert Durst who came from a very wealthy real estate family.
He married a beautiful woman named Kathie.
Played by you, and then in 1982, khht, she was gone.
Nobody has ever found the body.
He was never charged with the murder.
He's still alive.
I remember saying to my partner,
"I would like to make a movie
"that Robert Durst himself could
"sit and watch, and have an emotional reaction to."
A call comes through.
And I pick it up.
And a sort of smaller voice on the line says, "Hello.
I-I-Is this Eamonn Bowles?"
So I said, "Yes."
He goes, "Oh, this is Bob Durst."
My blood froze.
I went like, "Um, oh, hello, excuse me.
Who is this?
I thought this was someone else.
Who's calling?"
And he's like, "This is Bob Durst.
I'm looking for Andrew Jarecki." And I'm like, "Oh!"
Hello?
Hi.
Mr. Durst?
Hi, Mr. Jarecki.
How are you?
I'm good.
How are you?
Good.
I just saw the movie.
So, I h-h-have an idea.
I've no idea if it makes any sense.
But, but you're the one to talk to about it.
- Sure.
- Would it make sense for as in some capacity there to be an interview with me related to what's in the movie?
Yeah, I think that's a fascinating idea.
I'll be in touch soon.
I'm glad that we had a chance to talk.
All righty.
Bye-bye.
Nice to talk to you.
Mr. Jarecki.
- How are you?
- Good.
How are you?
Good.
I think you should feel free to call me "Andrew," by the way.
Andrew, how are you?
I have over the years been approached by all the various interview shows.
And I'm not interested in doing a "True Crime" kind of stuff.
Right.
You know more about Robert Durst than any of those people do.
I guess the question is, you know, has anybody really done a piece on you where they didn't walk into it with a very strong assumption?
One possibility is to have me interview you after having made this film.
I would tend to cooperate with you with whatever it was you're going to do.
You, you've got all my phone numbers.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Sounds good.
Talk to you soon.
Bye-bye.
As a criminal defense lawyer, you don't always get the truth.
I'm not naive enough to think that you do.
But you try to make a judgment of whether you're getting the truth.
When you only have a murderer's word for what happened, why believe anything that comes out of the man's mouth?
What I need to say to you is that I believe Bob, and I believed him from the very beginning.
I don't think Bob Durst is the kind of man that kills for the thrill of the kill.
I don't think he takes any particular pleasure in killing.
But if you back him in a corner, if you threaten his freedom, he'll kill ya.

MAN:
Dispatch called me at my house.
It was after hours.
They told me that a young kid had found what they thought was a torso.
No head.
No arms.
No legs.
Just, just the torso.
_
MAN:
What's this area here?
This is Channel View here... and it was right down here... in this corner, was where the torso was at.
- Right here?
- Right here.
This is probably the one time
I can honestly say that I've actually reached down somebody's throat.
Because in order to get the torso out,
I had to take my hand down the throat and put my fingers around the breastbone, and then pull him up out of the water.
- Is that with your hand?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
How else am I going to get him out?
JONES:
And then we started our kind of a general survey of the rest of the area.
In doing so, that's when we found a bunch of the black plastic trash bags that were floating in the water.
Well, trying to figure out what we had inside the bags, we simply palpated the bags.
We just felt them.
We had what felt like arms and hands, fingers.
A leg, where you could feel the knee, the ankle, and the actual foot itself... and one of the bags containing the legs, there was like small holes that had gotten torn into the bag where we could actually look in,
and I recall seeing a toe.
MAN:
Dismemberment started with the right leg and went to the left leg, to the left arm, to the neck, and then to the right arm.
The right arm, being the last, was cut but it was only sawn halfway through, and then it apparently broke, either by stepping on it or something, to break the bone.
Getting tired, running out of time...
Whatever it was.
MAN:
I'd never had a dismembered headless torso to investigate.
You know, I've investigated my fair share of shootings, homicides...
A whole array of investigations...
Thousands!
But I never had one of these.
So, I knew it was going to be interesting.
I had no idea of what I was fixin' to step into.
If I had of, I'm, I'm not so sure
I would have stepped in so willingly.

MAN:
A teenage boy fishing in the shallow waters off Galveston, Texas, stumbled on the gruesome remains of a murder.
SECOND MAN:
Pretty much everything had washed up, with the exception of the head.
That was the focus of several days of searching.
That's the only body part that was never recovered.
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
One of the most important things that we found initially was a newspaper.
We were able to read an address of 2213 Avenue K.
And the blood that we found on the stair rail, it actually started kind of a trail that came right out here.
And it went in right out to the, to the road.
JONES:
We found out who owned the building.
It was a guy by the name of Klaus Dillman.
Was able to ascertain that the tenant downstairs was an older man named Morris Black that lived in Apartment Number 1.
And then Apartment Number 2, he said, was rented by a little old lady named Dorothy Ciner, who was a mute female.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
We were able to roll one of the fingerprints from the hand that was in the trash bag.
From that, we were able to identify the victim as Morris Black.
[Camera shutter clicks]
BENNETT:
It appeared that in the common hallway, someone had wiped up blood which led into Apartment 2, which helped me to gain a search warrant into Apartment 2.
JONES:
What we observed then was a pretty pristine apartment.
Very neat.
What was unusual was on the floor of the kitchen were drop cloths.
Once we got the drop cloths pulled up from the floor, we found some real small cuts.
What I wound up doing was to actually take and cut that entire area out.
That's when I found a bloodstain.
We were actually able to match the blood back to Morris Black, so we knew that that's the location where he had been dismembered.
CAZALAS:
When we first talked to the landlord, he said,
"Well, there's a lady that rents Apartment Number 2, but she's never there because she travels all the time."
And I'm thinking to myself...
"Well, if she's got the money to travel all the time,
"and she's gone for months on end, what's she doing living in this dump?"
_
_
_
_
_
_
Ha!
In fact, it was kind of described as a real ugly deaf mute woman.
[Chuckles]
CAZALAS:
There was very little personal items in the apartment.
There was nothing to suggest a woman lived there.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
CAZALAS:
Red flags started coming up.
A mute female that travels a lot.
But a guy will be coming around every now and then.
Well, I'm thinking, "Well, there's no Dorothy Ciner,
"that's just a cover.
This guy is renting this place for whatever reason."
[Birds cooing]
JONES:
The next step was to go through the trash can in the alley behind the house.
Every piece of trash was taken out, photographed, labeled, catalogued.
_
_
JONES:
It was an appointment receipt, and on that contained information that gave us a date and time in which some eyeglasses were to be picked up.
CAZALAS:
Now I'm thinking, "Who's Robert Durst?"
Still a bunch of question marks.
I take the receipt to the eye clinic.
Ask them if they know who Robert Durst is.
The lady up front said, "Yeah, he was supposed to pick those glasses up on Friday."
I'm thinking, "Vegas wouldn't touch these odds this guy's going to show up."
But I said, "If he shows up, here's my card.
Here's my pager number." And I left.
JONES:
In the trash bags, we also found a price tag from Chalmers Hardware, which was two blocks away from where Morris Black lived.
BENNETT:
Among the things that were bought from Chalmers were a 4-inch paring knife and drop cloths with the Chalmers tags on it.
CAZALAS:
Also bought at Chalmers was a bow saw.
Lo and behold, my pager goes off.
And I'm like...
and I recognized that number.
But I, I haven't, in my mind I didn't connect the dots yet.
And then they had put in "911." I'm thinking, "Who is that?"
Then, bam!
"That's the eye clinic."
I jump in my car and I'm coming up 21st Street.
And he pulls out of the alleyway parking lot right in front of me, and pulls up to the red light, and I'm right behind him.
[Siren wailing]
CAZALAS:
Our Motor Division pulls him over, and we detain him.
JONES:
I recall pulling up to that, and I walked up and glanced down through the back windshield.
And the first thing I saw was a bow saw.
Kind of got that grin.
Saying, "Yeah, we got him."
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Camera shutter clicks]
BURROWS:
Initial impressions when I saw him being brought in was like, "Really?
This guy?
Did that?
Didn't fit."
[Camera shutter clicks]
CAZALAS:
God, the guy looks like a librarian!
He doesn't look like a person that would dismember a human being.
I explained to him he'd been arrested for, you know, homicide.
"Your bond has been set at $250,000."
And he asked me, he said, "Well, what should I do?"
And I said, "I don't know.
Do you have $250,000?"
And he just calmly looked at me and he goes, "Well, not on me."
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
Who the hell is this guy to give you that type of an answer?
Which is not the type of answer you would normally hear.
CAZALAS:
I get a call from the desk sergeant at the jail.
He goes, "Cody, this Durst guy,
"he made a phone call to somebody named
"Debrah in New York.
"Told them he was in Galveston, Texas,
"under arrest for murder, and he needed $250,000.
And she said, "No problem, it will be there in the morning."
And I'm thinking, "What's going on here?"
[Buzzer]
MAN:
Are you the wife of Robert Durst?
Yes.
When did you marry him?
_
December 2000.
Would that have been December 11, 2000?
- Yes.
- OK.
When did you first hear that Mr. Durst had rented an apartment in Galveston, Texas?
Um, I heard that he rented an apartment in Galveston, Texas certainly after October 9, 2001.
OK.
And why are you so definite about that date?
Because that was the day he called me, after he was arrested.
And I never even heard of Galveston, Texas.
When he called you, where was he calling from?
Jail.
How long was it from the time that he was arrested until he got out of jail on bail?
- 24 hours.
- OK.
When he got out, where did he go?
[Laughs] I'm in New York.
He's in Galveston.
He probably went to the bail bondsman's office first.
And then he probably went home.
Do I know?
Was I there?
I wasn't there.
CAZALAS:
I'm back at work the next morning about 7:30.
I get to my office.
Usually on my phone there may be one or two messages.
I get to, I get my cup of coffee,
I sit down, my light's blinking.
21 messages.
That's when the information about who Robert Durst really was started coming into play.
_
We get this tip that a Bob Durst has been arrested in Galveston and he's murdered his, his neighbor or something.
And it was like, "Holy shit!
Can this be our Bob Durst?"
The fact that Morris Black had been murdered in Galveston was not something that would have garnered any attention at our end.
It was only when they made the connection to Robert Durst.
_
CAZALAS:
You find out that he belongs to one of the richest families in New York City.
But that's not strange enough, the guy's also suspected in his wife's disappearance in New York.
_
MAN:
Robert Durst first made headlines after he reported his wife missing in 1982.
And to this day, the case remains unsolved.
_
The family of Kathleen Durst, from the beginning, had said they believed Robert Durst was responsible.
He had always maintained his innocence.
Family sources tell News Channel 4
Robert Durst relocated to Galveston, Texas, but they were unsure what he was doing there.
WOMAN:
How many office buildings does the Durst Organization currently own?
Nine.
And can you tell me what those office buildings are?
655 Third Avenue, 675 Third Avenue, 205 East 42nd Street, 733 Avenue of the Americas,
825 Avenue of the Americas, Four Times Square, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, 1155 Avenue of the Americas, and 114 West 47th Street.
_
_
_
Most defendants charged with murder show up at their arraignment, OK?
Did I expect him to be there?
Of course I did.
I wanted to eyeball this guy.
I wanted to size him up.
CAZALAS:
Robert was due to be in court at 10:00 a.m.
And he was a no-show.
He decided to run.
_
In the search for Robert Durst, a lawyer is asking him to surrender.
Attorney Michael Kennedy made an appeal to him to turn himself in.
KENNEDY:
Robert, if you see this or hear this, please come home.
You have loved ones who care about you here in New York.
Your family is solidly, unifiedly behind you.
The Trust has the wherewithal to pay for your legal defense.
WOMAN:
The press reported that you had hired a bodyguard to protect yourself against Robert Durst.
Is that true?
- That is true, yes.
- MAN:
Objection.
WOMAN:
Did you believe your life was threatened by Robert Durst?
At that point in time...
Robert's actions were bizarre, and while I wasn't sure,
I felt that, to protect my family was a reasonable action to take.
WOMAN:
And when did you hire the, the bodyguard?
In, uh, after Robert jumped bail in Texas.
JONES:
All the wheels started turning.
How do we find this guy?
Everything from state and local agency notifications to notifications to Interpol.
There's no telling where this guy could have gone.
MAN:
A private investigator told a Galveston newspaper that Durst has used false names in the past.
He had disguised himself as a woman.
His alias, Dorothy Ciner, is even listed on the FBI's 10 most wanted list.
CAZALAS:
Dorothy Ciner was somebody he went to
Scarsdale High School with.
_
We found a bank account that he had set up as Emilio Vignoni.
He had rented a car from a place in Mobile, Alabama, saying he was Morris Black.
And we know there were probably more.
He's not crazy.
He's diabolical.
BAGLI:
When Bob didn't show up at his hearing and we realize he's on the run,
I was as curious as anyone else about where he was.
And so, I was calling places where he had lived.
_
"When Robert A. Durst returned to
"South Salem in Westchester County,
"a neighbor noticed him seemingly lost in thought
"on a dock at Lake Truesdale,
"behind the tree-shrouded stone cottage he once shared with his wife Kathleen."
"It was his birthday and their wedding anniversary,
"though she had vanished 19 years earlier.
"The State Police and the Westchester District Attorney
"had been seeking him for a year
"to go over his account of his last night with his wife...
"The night she vanished.
"Mr. Durst's reverie on the dock
"suddenly ended when a neighbor strolled down to the lakefront."
That neighbor, of course, was the woman that moved into the house that Bob had lived in, and that Kathie had disappeared from.
It was always piecing together these shreds of information.
It was hazy, but it began to tell a story about this guy who, of course, was an enigma.
WOMAN: 58-year-old Robert Durst was arrested here at Wegmans Grocery Store in Hanover Township after allegedly trying to steal a hoagie.
JONES:
I think we were kind of in the same boat as everybody else that had any knowledge of this case whatsoever.
How in the hell could he have been that stupid?
MAN:
He just kind of got cold look.
All the color ran out of his face, and he just stared at me, and he said, "I'm not saying another word until I speak to an attorney."
MAN:
Police searched his rental car outside...
[Camera shutter clicks]
MAN:
And found two loaded guns, [Camera shutter clicks] some marijuana, [Camera shutter clicks]
$38,000 in cash, and an I.D. for one "Morris Black."
BAGLI:
Why would a guy with $520 in his pocket and $37,000 in the trunk walk into a Wegmans and steal a sandwich?
The guy is crying out to be arrested, isn't he?
On the other hand, he's also a guy that sort of walks through life and thinks he can do whatever he wants to do.
And most of the time, he could.
WOMAN:
In shackles and under heavy guard, 58-year-old Robert Durst is led into the courtroom.
SECOND WOMAN:
Mr. Durst, are you going to fight extradition?
MAN:
He has no comment at this time.
Are you competent to stand trial?
He has no comment.
WOMAN:
Where is your wife?
MAN:
How long was he in jail in Pennsylvania?
DEBRAH:
About two months.
Did you speak to him while he was in jail?
Sure.
Did you call him?
It doesn't work that way.
OK.
He called you from jail in Pennsylvania?
- Yes.
- OK.
During that time, did he call you regularly?
Yes.
And in any of those conversations, did he indicate what his plans were in the future?
Since I'm sure that you know that those conversations were taped, and they probably are public, you could read for yourself, because I don't really remember what conversations we had.
_
DURST ON TAPE:
It's very cold in this prison.
DEBRAH ON TAPE:
Yeah, cold out.
DURST:
Well, it's cold out, but I feel like it's cold in this prison.
I'm sitting here all covered with a sweatshirt.
Some guys were quote unquote "in paper."
DEBRAH:
I know that.
You told me.
Honey, now when you're now sitting in your room, do you wear that thing or not?
DURST:
Sometimes I do.
Sometimes I don't.
It's very warm.
It is comfy.
I never wore a jumpsuit until I got here.
It's a very comfy thing.
It's easy to take on and off.
Right now, I'm out here in the thing and I have it on o-o-over my l-l-long johns.
And a sweatshirt.
And it's still cold.
MAN:
The time now is approximately 10:34 a.m.
We're on record.
WOMAN:
I'm going to swear you in, sir, if you raise your right hand, please.
Do you solemnly swear or affirm the testimony you are about to give to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Yes, ma'am.
MAN:
Will you state your full name for the record, please?
Robert Durst.
Am I correct that from the 1970s until 1994, you worked in the Durst Family business?
Sort of, yes.
What were your positions there?
- My titles?
- Yes.
I had various important-sounding titles, but I didn't really go there very much.
WOMAN:
Can you tell me under what circumstances
Robert left the Durst Organization in the mid Nineties?
At some point, Robert stopped showing up for, stopped showing up to the office.
And did you ever make any inquiries why he stopped showing up at the office?
I, I did, yes.
And what did you find out?
At that time, he would not talk to me.
MAN:
Did you quit the family business in 1994 after Douglas Durst was picked to run the family businesses?
Well, he was pretty much picked in 1989-90, I remember.
Who picked him?
Uh, the senior generation...
Seymour Durst, David Durst, Roy Durst.
And Seymour Durst was your father?
Yes.
MAN:
In fact, Mr. Durst, you've threatened to kill your brother, haven't you?
- No, sir.
- OK.
DEBRAH:
He screwed you out of everything.
Your birthright.
The entire Durst Organization.
And you forgot?
DURST:
Right.
He took over the family business.
No doubt about it.
DEBRAH:
OK.
He took it from you.
He could have done it with you.
There were a lot of choices he could have done, but no.
He took it from you and his plan was to destroy you and embarrass you.
And he did it.
MAN:
Quote, "The level of enmity is so great that Douglas Durst
"even went so far as to hire a bodyguard to protect himself from Robert Durst."
Close quote.
Do you remember that allegation?
DURST:
I remember that that occurred.
Do you know why Douglas Durst hired a bodyguard?
Because he's a pussy.
Did he hire the bodyguard because he was scared of you?
I have knowledge that he'd hired a bodyguard.
Why he would be scared of me, I have no idea.
MAN:
New York real estate heir Robert Durst will be turned over to Texas authorities this week.
He faces charges in the dismemberment murder of a 71-year-old neighbor.
Yesterday in Pennsylvania, the 58-year-old waived his right to contest his extradition to Texas.
WOMAN ON RECORDING:
It's going to be a media circus there.
DURST ON RECORDING:
I know it is.
I'm trying not to think about it, and I'm trying not to, to plan, what kind of look I should have on my face.
- WOMAN:
I know.
- DURST:
Am I supposed to be smiling?
Or am I supposed to be grim?
WOMAN:
If you're thinking of expression,
I would just have like as close to no expression as you can possibly have...
DURST:
Yeah.
That's what I keep... _
The defendant in this case was one who's wanted for a serious crime... murder...
in the state of Texas.
There was a nationwide manhunt for this individual, and it's thanks to the Pennsylvania authorities that he was picked up, arrested, and kept here.
And so we thank the D.A. Morganelli for this.
And with respect to the New York case and in response to your question, let me just say that the disappearance of Kathleen Durst 20 years ago is a case that we are actively investigating.
We continue to seek the public's cooperation.
And as time goes on, we're finding that more and more people are cooperating with us.
And we will get to the bottom of what happened to Kathleen Durst, one way or the other.
DURST ON RECORDING:
Now Jeanine Pirro can go to the grand jury and say, "This person is going to be tried for murder in Galveston."
That's going to make it much more likely that they're going to want to indict me for Kathie.
DEBRAH ON RECORDING:
Bob, she hasn't arrested you because she doesn't have anything.
You're going to be all right.
I promise.
- DURST:
OK.
- DEBRAH:
All right.
You got to chin up.
You'll be OK.
- DURST:
Thank you.
- DEBRAH:
I love you, honey.
DURST:
I love you.
- DEBRAH:
Bye.
- DURST:
Bye.
Have your investigators been able to talk to Robert Durst?
No, they have not.
He's represented by an attorney.
As D.A. Morganelli has said, it's the attorneys that we speak to.
MAN:
Do you have any comment on what happened today with your client?
Well, it's very straightforward.
Mr. Durst is anxious to get to Texas to defend himself on the charges pending there.
He has a viable defense, and he wants to raise it.
Therefore, he chose to voluntarily waive extradition and not seek to fight extradition.
And we expect that he'll be moved forthwith to Texas where, with two of my colleagues down there, we'll begin further to prepare his defense.
And that defense would be an insanity defense?
No.
I'm not going to comment on the defense.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
MAN:
Did you at any time tell Mr. Durst that you'd divorce him if he retained Michael Kennedy?
Yes.
Why did you say that to him?
Because I didn't trust Michael Kennedy.
I didn't like Michael Kennedy.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
MAN:
I'm quoting again from the tapes.
Do you recall your wife threatening
"I won't stand by you anymore," close quote, if Michael Kennedy wasn't fired as your lawyer?
Yes.
Michael Kennedy was the one who was hired by Douglas to represent me.
And I had no intention of hiring Michael Kennedy anyway.
WOMAN:
Robert Durst returned to Texas tonight.
The heir to a Manhattan skyscraper fortune is charged with murdering and dismembering his Galveston neighbor.
Well, I'm Dick DeGuerin.
I've been practicing law since 1965.
_
Almost all of that time in criminal law.
Either as a prosecutor, where I started, or as a criminal defense lawyer once I saw the light.
_
_
_
MAN:
And then she says, "I will fight for what I want and I will fight you hard," close quote.
[Chuckles] Well, that's Debbie.
MAN:
Do you remember that conversation?
I don't remember that one specifically, but the big argument then was that I wanted to hire
Dick DeGuerin to represent me, and she wanted me to hire Mike Ramsey.
Durst couldn't decide between Ramsey and me, so, he hired both of us.
_
_
_
_
_

MAN:
All Good Things, a new feature film, premiered at the SVA Cinema in Chelsea.
The film was inspired by one of the most notorious missing persons cases in New York City history.
MAN:
Andrew, what brought you to this film?
Well, I'm always interested in, interested in these sort of monster stories.
You know, you find out that somebody is described as a maniac or a crazy person or a, a serial killer, and I always think that those people started out somewhere.
You know, they started out as people, and they had hopes and dreams.
He was an unusual person.
So, he did unusual things.
Stranger than fiction, in a lot of ways.
I remember this case because it's based on one of the great murder mysteries.
There was a man named Robert Durst who came from a very wealthy real estate family.
He married a beautiful woman named Kathie.
Played by you, and then in 1982, khht, she was gone.
Nobody has ever found the body.
He was never charged with the murder.
He's still alive.
I remember saying to my partner,
"I would like to make a movie
"that Robert Durst himself could
"sit and watch, and have an emotional reaction to."
A call comes through.
And I pick it up.
And a sort of smaller voice on the line says, "Hello.
I-I-Is this Eamonn Bowles?"
So I said, "Yes."
He goes, "Oh, this is Bob Durst."
[Laughs] My blood froze.
I went like, "Um, oh, hello, excuse me.
Who is this?
I thought this was someone else.
Who's calling?"
And he's like, "This is Bob Durst.
I'm looking for Andrew Jarecki." And I'm like, "Oh!"
[Telephone ringing]
DURST ON RECORDING:
Hello?
JARECKI ON RECORDING:
Hi.
Mr. Durst?
DURST:
Hi, Mr. Jarecki.
How are you?
JARECKI:
I'm good.
How are you?
DURST:
Good.
I just saw the movie.
So, I h-h-have an idea.
I've no idea if it makes any sense.
But, but you're the one to talk to about it.
- JARECKI:
Sure.
- DURST:
Would it make sense for as in some capacity there to be an interview with me related to what's in the movie?
JARECKI:
Yeah, I think that's a fascinating idea.
I'll be in touch soon.
I'm glad that we had a chance to talk.
DURST:
All righty.
Bye-bye.
JARECKI:
Nice to talk to you.
[Hangs up]
[Telephone ringing]
DURST ON RECORDING:
Mr. Jarecki.
- JARECKI ON RECORDING:
How are you?
- DURST:
Good.
How are you?
JARECKI:
Good.
I think you should feel free to call me "Andrew," by the way.
DURST:
Andrew, how are you?
I have over the years been approached by all the various interview shows.
And I'm not interested in doing a "True Crime" kind of stuff.
JARECKI:
Right.
DURST:
You know more about Robert Durst than any of those people do.
JARECKI:
I guess the question is, you know, has anybody really done a piece on you where they didn't walk into it with a very strong assumption?
One possibility is to have me interview you after having made this film.
DURST:
I would tend to cooperate with you with whatever it was you're going to do.
You, you've got all my phone numbers.
I look forward to hearing from you.
JARECKI:
Sounds good.
Talk to you soon.
DURST:
Bye-bye.
[Static]
DeGUERIN:
As a criminal defense lawyer, you don't always get the truth.
I'm not naive enough to think that you do.
But you try to make a judgment of whether you're getting the truth.
CAZALAS:
When you only have a murderer's word for what happened, why believe anything that comes out of the man's mouth?
DeGUERIN:
What I need to say to you is that I believe Bob, and I believed him from the very beginning.
CAZALAS:
I don't think Bob Durst is the kind of man that kills for the thrill of the kill.
I don't think he takes any particular pleasure in killing.
But if you back him in a corner, if you threaten his freedom, he'll kill ya.
_
MAN:
Dispatch called me at my house.
It was after hours.
They told me that a young kid had found what they thought was a torso.
No head.
No arms.
No legs.
Just, just the torso.
_
MAN:
What's this area here?
This is Channel View here... and it was right down here... in this corner, was where the torso was at.
- Right here?
- Right here.
This is probably the one time
I can honestly say that I've actually reached down somebody's throat.
Because in order to get the torso out,
I had to take my hand down the throat and put my fingers around the breastbone, and then pull him up out of the water.
- Is that with your hand?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
How else am I going to get him out?
JONES:
And then we started our kind of a general survey of the rest of the area.
In doing so, that's when we found a bunch of the black plastic trash bags that were floating in the water.
Well, trying to figure out what we had inside the bags, we simply palpated the bags.
We just felt them.
We had what felt like arms and hands, fingers.
A leg, where you could feel the knee, the ankle, and the actual foot itself... and one of the bags containing the legs, there was like small holes that had gotten torn into the bag where we could actually look in,
and I recall seeing a toe.
MAN:
Dismemberment started with the right leg and went to the left leg, to the left arm, to the neck, and then to the right arm.
The right arm, being the last, was cut but it was only sawn halfway through, and then it apparently broke, either by stepping on it or something, to break the bone.
Getting tired, running out of time...
Whatever it was.
MAN:
I'd never had a dismembered headless torso to investigate.
You know, I've investigated my fair share of shootings, homicides...
A whole array of investigations...
Thousands!
But I never had one of these.
So, I knew it was going to be interesting.
I had no idea of what I was fixin' to step into.
If I had of, I'm, I'm not so sure
I would have stepped in so willingly.

MAN:
A teenage boy fishing in the shallow waters off Galveston, Texas, stumbled on the gruesome remains of a murder.
SECOND MAN:
Pretty much everything had washed up, with the exception of the head.
That was the focus of several days of searching.
That's the only body part that was never recovered.
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
One of the most important things that we found initially was a newspaper.
We were able to read an address of 2213 Avenue K.
And the blood that we found on the stair rail, it actually started kind of a trail that came right out here.
And it went in right out to the, to the road.
JONES:
We found out who owned the building.
It was a guy by the name of Klaus Dillman.
Was able to ascertain that the tenant downstairs was an older man named Morris Black that lived in Apartment Number 1.
And then Apartment Number 2, he said, was rented by a little old lady named Dorothy Ciner, who was a mute female.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
We were able to roll one of the fingerprints from the hand that was in the trash bag.
From that, we were able to identify the victim as Morris Black.
[Camera shutter clicks]
BENNETT:
It appeared that in the common hallway, someone had wiped up blood which led into Apartment 2, which helped me to gain a search warrant into Apartment 2.
JONES:
What we observed then was a pretty pristine apartment.
Very neat.
What was unusual was on the floor of the kitchen were drop cloths.
Once we got the drop cloths pulled up from the floor, we found some real small cuts.
What I wound up doing was to actually take and cut that entire area out.
That's when I found a bloodstain.
We were actually able to match the blood back to Morris Black, so we knew that that's the location where he had been dismembered.
CAZALAS:
When we first talked to the landlord, he said,
"Well, there's a lady that rents Apartment Number 2, but she's never there because she travels all the time."
And I'm thinking to myself...
"Well, if she's got the money to travel all the time,
"and she's gone for months on end, what's she doing living in this dump?"
_
_
_
_
_
_
Ha!
In fact, it was kind of described as a real ugly deaf mute woman.
[Chuckles]
CAZALAS:
There was very little personal items in the apartment.
There was nothing to suggest a woman lived there.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
CAZALAS:
Red flags started coming up.
A mute female that travels a lot.
But a guy will be coming around every now and then.
Well, I'm thinking, "Well, there's no Dorothy Ciner,
"that's just a cover.
This guy is renting this place for whatever reason."
[Birds cooing]
JONES:
The next step was to go through the trash can in the alley behind the house.
Every piece of trash was taken out, photographed, labeled, catalogued.
_
_
JONES:
It was an appointment receipt, and on that contained information that gave us a date and time in which some eyeglasses were to be picked up.
CAZALAS:
Now I'm thinking, "Who's Robert Durst?"
Still a bunch of question marks.
I take the receipt to the eye clinic.
Ask them if they know who Robert Durst is.
The lady up front said, "Yeah, he was supposed to pick those glasses up on Friday."
I'm thinking, "Vegas wouldn't touch these odds this guy's going to show up."
But I said, "If he shows up, here's my card.
Here's my pager number." And I left.
JONES:
In the trash bags, we also found a price tag from Chalmers Hardware, which was two blocks away from where Morris Black lived.
BENNETT:
Among the things that were bought from Chalmers were a 4-inch paring knife and drop cloths with the Chalmers tags on it.
CAZALAS:
Also bought at Chalmers was a bow saw.
Lo and behold, my pager goes off.
And I'm like...
and I recognized that number.
But I, I haven't, in my mind I didn't connect the dots yet.
And then they had put in "911." I'm thinking, "Who is that?"
Then, bam!
"That's the eye clinic."
I jump in my car and I'm coming up 21st Street.
And he pulls out of the alleyway parking lot right in front of me, and pulls up to the red light, and I'm right behind him.
[Siren wailing]
CAZALAS:
Our Motor Division pulls him over, and we detain him.
JONES:
I recall pulling up to that, and I walked up and glanced down through the back windshield.
And the first thing I saw was a bow saw.
Kind of got that grin.
Saying, "Yeah, we got him."
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Camera shutter clicks]
BURROWS:
Initial impressions when I saw him being brought in was like, "Really?
This guy?
Did that?
Didn't fit."
[Camera shutter clicks]
CAZALAS:
God, the guy looks like a librarian!
He doesn't look like a person that would dismember a human being.
I explained to him he'd been arrested for, you know, homicide.
"Your bond has been set at $250,000."
And he asked me, he said, "Well, what should I do?"
And I said, "I don't know.
Do you have $250,000?"
And he just calmly looked at me and he goes, "Well, not on me."
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
Who the hell is this guy to give you that type of an answer?
Which is not the type of answer you would normally hear.
CAZALAS:
I get a call from the desk sergeant at the jail.
He goes, "Cody, this Durst guy,
"he made a phone call to somebody named
"Debrah in New York.
"Told them he was in Galveston, Texas,
"under arrest for murder, and he needed $250,000.
And she said, "No problem, it will be there in the morning."
And I'm thinking, "What's going on here?"
[Buzzer]
MAN:
Are you the wife of Robert Durst?
Yes.
When did you marry him?
_
December 2000.
Would that have been December 11, 2000?
- Yes.
- OK.
When did you first hear that Mr. Durst had rented an apartment in Galveston, Texas?
Um, I heard that he rented an apartment in Galveston, Texas certainly after October 9, 2001.
OK.
And why are you so definite about that date?
Because that was the day he called me, after he was arrested.
And I never even heard of Galveston, Texas.
When he called you, where was he calling from?
Jail.
How long was it from the time that he was arrested until he got out of jail on bail?
- 24 hours.
- OK.
When he got out, where did he go?
[Laughs] I'm in New York.
He's in Galveston.
He probably went to the bail bondsman's office first.
And then he probably went home.
Do I know?
Was I there?
I wasn't there.
CAZALAS:
I'm back at work the next morning about 7:30.
I get to my office.
Usually on my phone there may be one or two messages.
I get to, I get my cup of coffee,
I sit down, my light's blinking.
21 messages.
That's when the information about who Robert Durst really was started coming into play.
_
We get this tip that a Bob Durst has been arrested in Galveston and he's murdered his, his neighbor or something.
And it was like, "Holy shit!
Can this be our Bob Durst?"
The fact that Morris Black had been murdered in Galveston was not something that would have garnered any attention at our end.
It was only when they made the connection to Robert Durst.
_
CAZALAS:
You find out that he belongs to one of the richest families in New York City.
But that's not strange enough, the guy's also suspected in his wife's disappearance in New York.
_
MAN:
Robert Durst first made headlines after he reported his wife missing in 1982.
And to this day, the case remains unsolved.
_
The family of Kathleen Durst, from the beginning, had said they believed Robert Durst was responsible.
He had always maintained his innocence.
Family sources tell News Channel 4
Robert Durst relocated to Galveston, Texas, but they were unsure what he was doing there.
WOMAN:
How many office buildings does the Durst Organization currently own?
Nine.
And can you tell me what those office buildings are?
655 Third Avenue, 675 Third Avenue, 205 East 42nd Street, 733 Avenue of the Americas,
825 Avenue of the Americas, Four Times Square, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, 1155 Avenue of the Americas, and 114 West 47th Street.
_
_
_
Most defendants charged with murder show up at their arraignment, OK?
Did I expect him to be there?
Of course I did.
I wanted to eyeball this guy.
I wanted to size him up.
CAZALAS:
Robert was due to be in court at 10:00 a.m.
And he was a no-show.
He decided to run.
_
In the search for Robert Durst, a lawyer is asking him to surrender.
Attorney Michael Kennedy made an appeal to him to turn himself in.
KENNEDY:
Robert, if you see this or hear this, please come home.
You have loved ones who care about you here in New York.
Your family is solidly, unifiedly behind you.
The Trust has the wherewithal to pay for your legal defense.
WOMAN:
The press reported that you had hired a bodyguard to protect yourself against Robert Durst.
Is that true?
- That is true, yes.
- MAN:
Objection.
WOMAN:
Did you believe your life was threatened by Robert Durst?
At that point in time...
Robert's actions were bizarre, and while I wasn't sure,
I felt that, to protect my family was a reasonable action to take.
WOMAN:
And when did you hire the, the bodyguard?
In, uh, after Robert jumped bail in Texas.
JONES:
All the wheels started turning.
How do we find this guy?
Everything from state and local agency notifications to notifications to Interpol.
There's no telling where this guy could have gone.
MAN:
A private investigator told a Galveston newspaper that Durst has used false names in the past.
He had disguised himself as a woman.
His alias, Dorothy Ciner, is even listed on the FBI's 10 most wanted list.
CAZALAS:
Dorothy Ciner was somebody he went to
Scarsdale High School with.
_
We found a bank account that he had set up as Emilio Vignoni.
He had rented a car from a place in Mobile, Alabama, saying he was Morris Black.
And we know there were probably more.
He's not crazy.
He's diabolical.
BAGLI:
When Bob didn't show up at his hearing and we realize he's on the run,
I was as curious as anyone else about where he was.
And so, I was calling places where he had lived.
_
"When Robert A. Durst returned to
"South Salem in Westchester County,
"a neighbor noticed him seemingly lost in thought
"on a dock at Lake Truesdale,
"behind the tree-shrouded stone cottage he once shared with his wife Kathleen."
"It was his birthday and their wedding anniversary,
"though she had vanished 19 years earlier.
"The State Police and the Westchester District Attorney
"had been seeking him for a year
"to go over his account of his last night with his wife...
"The night she vanished.
"Mr. Durst's reverie on the dock
"suddenly ended when a neighbor strolled down to the lakefront."
That neighbor, of course, was the woman that moved into the house that Bob had lived in, and that Kathie had disappeared from.
It was always piecing together these shreds of information.
It was hazy, but it began to tell a story about this guy who, of course, was an enigma.
WOMAN: 58-year-old Robert Durst was arrested here at Wegmans Grocery Store in Hanover Township after allegedly trying to steal a hoagie.
JONES:
I think we were kind of in the same boat as everybody else that had any knowledge of this case whatsoever.
How in the hell could he have been that stupid?
MAN:
He just kind of got cold look.
All the color ran out of his face, and he just stared at me, and he said, "I'm not saying another word until I speak to an attorney."
MAN:
Police searched his rental car outside...
[Camera shutter clicks]
MAN:
And found two loaded guns, [Camera shutter clicks] some marijuana, [Camera shutter clicks]
$38,000 in cash, and an I.D. for one "Morris Black."
BAGLI:
Why would a guy with $520 in his pocket and $37,000 in the trunk walk into a Wegmans and steal a sandwich?
The guy is crying out to be arrested, isn't he?
On the other hand, he's also a guy that sort of walks through life and thinks he can do whatever he wants to do.
And most of the time, he could.
WOMAN:
In shackles and under heavy guard, 58-year-old Robert Durst is led into the courtroom.
SECOND WOMAN:
Mr. Durst, are you going to fight extradition?
MAN:
He has no comment at this time.
Are you competent to stand trial?
He has no comment.
WOMAN:
Where is your wife?
MAN:
How long was he in jail in Pennsylvania?
DEBRAH:
About two months.
Did you speak to him while he was in jail?
Sure.
Did you call him?
It doesn't work that way.
OK.
He called you from jail in Pennsylvania?
- Yes.
- OK.
During that time, did he call you regularly?
Yes.
And in any of those conversations, did he indicate what his plans were in the future?
Since I'm sure that you know that those conversations were taped, and they probably are public, you could read for yourself, because I don't really remember what conversations we had.
_
DURST ON TAPE:
It's very cold in this prison.
DEBRAH ON TAPE:
Yeah, cold out.
DURST:
Well, it's cold out, but I feel like it's cold in this prison.
I'm sitting here all covered with a sweatshirt.
Some guys were quote unquote "in paper."
DEBRAH:
I know that.
You told me.
Honey, now when you're now sitting in your room, do you wear that thing or not?
DURST:
Sometimes I do.
Sometimes I don't.
It's very warm.
It is comfy.
I never wore a jumpsuit until I got here.
It's a very comfy thing.
It's easy to take on and off.
Right now, I'm out here in the thing and I have it on o-o-over my l-l-long johns.
And a sweatshirt.
And it's still cold.
MAN:
The time now is approximately 10:34 a.m.
We're on record.
WOMAN:
I'm going to swear you in, sir, if you raise your right hand, please.
Do you solemnly swear or affirm the testimony you are about to give to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Yes, ma'am.
MAN:
Will you state your full name for the record, please?
Robert Durst.
Am I correct that from the 1970s until 1994, you worked in the Durst Family business?
Sort of, yes.
What were your positions there?
- My titles?
- Yes.
I had various important-sounding titles, but I didn't really go there very much.
WOMAN:
Can you tell me under what circumstances
Robert left the Durst Organization in the mid Nineties?
At some point, Robert stopped showing up for, stopped showing up to the office.
And did you ever make any inquiries why he stopped showing up at the office?
I, I did, yes.
And what did you find out?
At that time, he would not talk to me.
MAN:
Did you quit the family business in 1994 after Douglas Durst was picked to run the family businesses?
Well, he was pretty much picked in 1989-90, I remember.
Who picked him?
Uh, the senior generation...
Seymour Durst, David Durst, Roy Durst.
And Seymour Durst was your father?
Yes.
MAN:
In fact, Mr. Durst, you've threatened to kill your brother, haven't you?
- No, sir.
- OK.
DEBRAH:
He screwed you out of everything.
Your birthright.
The entire Durst Organization.
And you forgot?
DURST:
Right.
He took over the family business.
No doubt about it.
DEBRAH:
OK.
He took it from you.
He could have done it with you.
There were a lot of choices he could have done, but no.
He took it from you and his plan was to destroy you and embarrass you.
And he did it.
MAN:
Quote, "The level of enmity is so great that Douglas Durst
"even went so far as to hire a bodyguard to protect himself from Robert Durst."
Close quote.
Do you remember that allegation?
DURST:
I remember that that occurred.
Do you know why Douglas Durst hired a bodyguard?
Because he's a pussy.
Did he hire the bodyguard because he was scared of you?
I have knowledge that he'd hired a bodyguard.
Why he would be scared of me, I have no idea.
MAN:
New York real estate heir Robert Durst will be turned over to Texas authorities this week.
He faces charges in the dismemberment murder of a 71-year-old neighbor.
Yesterday in Pennsylvania, the 58-year-old waived his right to contest his extradition to Texas.
WOMAN ON RECORDING:
It's going to be a media circus there.
DURST ON RECORDING:
I know it is.
I'm trying not to think about it, and I'm trying not to, to plan, what kind of look I should have on my face.
- WOMAN:
I know.
- DURST:
Am I supposed to be smiling?
Or am I supposed to be grim?
WOMAN:
If you're thinking of expression,
I would just have like as close to no expression as you can possibly have...
DURST:
Yeah.
That's what I keep... _
The defendant in this case was one who's wanted for a serious crime... murder...
in the state of Texas.
There was a nationwide manhunt for this individual, and it's thanks to the Pennsylvania authorities that he was picked up, arrested, and kept here.
And so we thank the D.A. Morganelli for this.
And with respect to the New York case and in response to your question, let me just say that the disappearance of Kathleen Durst 20 years ago is a case that we are actively investigating.
We continue to seek the public's cooperation.
And as time goes on, we're finding that more and more people are cooperating with us.
And we will get to the bottom of what happened to Kathleen Durst, one way or the other.
DURST ON RECORDING:
Now Jeanine Pirro can go to the grand jury and say, "This person is going to be tried for murder in Galveston."
That's going to make it much more likely that they're going to want to indict me for Kathie.
DEBRAH ON RECORDING:
Bob, she hasn't arrested you because she doesn't have anything.
You're going to be all right.
I promise.
- DURST:
OK.
- DEBRAH:
All right.
You got to chin up.
You'll be OK.
- DURST:
Thank you.
- DEBRAH:
I love you, honey.
DURST:
I love you.
- DEBRAH:
Bye.
- DURST:
Bye.
Have your investigators been able to talk to Robert Durst?
No, they have not.
He's represented by an attorney.
As D.A. Morganelli has said, it's the attorneys that we speak to.
MAN:
Do you have any comment on what happened today with your client?
Well, it's very straightforward.
Mr. Durst is anxious to get to Texas to defend himself on the charges pending there.
He has a viable defense, and he wants to raise it.
Therefore, he chose to voluntarily waive extradition and not seek to fight extradition.
And we expect that he'll be moved forthwith to Texas where, with two of my colleagues down there, we'll begin further to prepare his defense.
And that defense would be an insanity defense?
No.
I'm not going to comment on the defense.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
MAN:
Did you at any time tell Mr. Durst that you'd divorce him if he retained Michael Kennedy?
Yes.
Why did you say that to him?
Because I didn't trust Michael Kennedy.
I didn't like Michael Kennedy.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
MAN:
I'm quoting again from the tapes.
Do you recall your wife threatening
"I won't stand by you anymore," close quote, if Michael Kennedy wasn't fired as your lawyer?
Yes.
Michael Kennedy was the one who was hired by Douglas to represent me.
And I had no intention of hiring Michael Kennedy anyway.
WOMAN:
Robert Durst returned to Texas tonight.
The heir to a Manhattan skyscraper fortune is charged with murdering and dismembering his Galveston neighbor.
Well, I'm Dick DeGuerin.
I've been practicing law since 1965.
_
Almost all of that time in criminal law.
Either as a prosecutor, where I started, or as a criminal defense lawyer once I saw the light.
_
_
_
MAN:
And then she says, "I will fight for what I want and I will fight you hard," close quote.
[Chuckles] Well, that's Debbie.
MAN:
Do you remember that conversation?
I don't remember that one specifically, but the big argument then was that I wanted to hire
Dick DeGuerin to represent me, and she wanted me to hire Mike Ramsey.
Durst couldn't decide between Ramsey and me, so, he hired both of us.
_
_
_
_
_
_

MAN:
All Good Things, a new feature film, premiered at the SVA Cinema in Chelsea.
The film was inspired by one of the most notorious missing persons cases in New York City history.
MAN:
Andrew, what brought you to this film?
Well, I'm always interested in, interested in these sort of monster stories.
You know, you find out that somebody is described as a maniac or a crazy person or a, a serial killer, and I always think that those people started out somewhere.
You know, they started out as people, and they had hopes and dreams.
He was an unusual person.
So, he did unusual things.
Stranger than fiction, in a lot of ways.
I remember this case because it's based on one of the great murder mysteries.
There was a man named Robert Durst who came from a very wealthy real estate family.
He married a beautiful woman named Kathie.
Played by you, and then in 1982, khht, she was gone.
Nobody has ever found the body.
He was never charged with the murder.
He's still alive.
I remember saying to my partner,
"I would like to make a movie
"that Robert Durst himself could
"sit and watch, and have an emotional reaction to."
A call comes through.
And I pick it up.
And a sort of smaller voice on the line says, "Hello.
I-I-Is this Eamonn Bowles?"
So I said, "Yes."
He goes, "Oh, this is Bob Durst."
[Laughs] My blood froze.
I went like, "Um, oh, hello, excuse me.
Who is this?
I thought this was someone else.
Who's calling?"
And he's like, "This is Bob Durst.
I'm looking for Andrew Jarecki." And I'm like, "Oh!"
[Telephone ringing]
DURST ON RECORDING:
Hello?
JARECKI ON RECORDING:
Hi.
Mr. Durst?
DURST:
Hi, Mr. Jarecki.
How are you?
JARECKI:
I'm good.
How are you?
DURST:
Good.
I just saw the movie.
So, I h-h-have an idea.
I've no idea if it makes any sense.
But, but you're the one to talk to about it.
- JARECKI:
Sure.
- DURST:
Would it make sense for as in some capacity there to be an interview with me related to what's in the movie?
JARECKI:
Yeah, I think that's a fascinating idea.
I'll be in touch soon.
I'm glad that we had a chance to talk.
DURST:
All righty.
Bye-bye.
JARECKI:
Nice to talk to you.
[Hangs up]
[Telephone ringing]
DURST ON RECORDING:
Mr. Jarecki.
- JARECKI ON RECORDING:
How are you?
- DURST:
Good.
How are you?
JARECKI:
Good.
I think you should feel free to call me "Andrew," by the way.
DURST:
Andrew, how are you?
I have over the years been approached by all the various interview shows.
And I'm not interested in doing a "True Crime" kind of stuff.
JARECKI:
Right.
DURST:
You know more about Robert Durst than any of those people do.
JARECKI:
I guess the question is, you know, has anybody really done a piece on you where they didn't walk into it with a very strong assumption?
One possibility is to have me interview you after having made this film.
DURST:
I would tend to cooperate with you with whatever it was you're going to do.
You, you've got all my phone numbers.
I look forward to hearing from you.
JARECKI:
Sounds good.
Talk to you soon.
DURST:
Bye-bye.
[Static]
DeGUERIN:
As a criminal defense lawyer, you don't always get the truth.
I'm not naive enough to think that you do.
But you try to make a judgment of whether you're getting the truth.
CAZALAS:
When you only have a murderer's word for what happened, why believe anything that comes out of the man's mouth?
DeGUERIN:
What I need to say to you is that I believe Bob, and I believed him from the very beginning.
CAZALAS:
I don't think Bob Durst is the kind of man that kills for the thrill of the kill.
I don't think he takes any particular pleasure in killing.
But if you back him in a corner, if you threaten his freedom, he'll kill ya.
MAN:
Dispatch called me at my house.
It was after hours.
They told me that a young kid had found what they thought was a torso.
No head.
No arms.
No legs.
Just, just the torso.
MAN:
What's this area here?
This is Channel View here... and it was right down here... in this corner, was where the torso was at.
- Right here?
- Right here.
This is probably the one time
I can honestly say that I've actually reached down somebody's throat.
Because in order to get the torso out,
I had to take my hand down the throat and put my fingers around the breastbone, and then pull him up out of the water.
- Is that with your hand?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
How else am I going to get him out?
JONES:
And then we started our kind of a general survey of the rest of the area.
In doing so, that's when we found a bunch of the black plastic trash bags that were floating in the water.
Well, trying to figure out what we had inside the bags, we simply palpated the bags.
We just felt them.
We had what felt like arms and hands, fingers.
A leg, where you could feel the knee, the ankle, and the actual foot itself... and one of the bags containing the legs, there was like small holes that had gotten torn into the bag where we could actually look in,
and I recall seeing a toe.
MAN:
Dismemberment started with the right leg and went to the left leg, to the left arm, to the neck, and then to the right arm.
The right arm, being the last, was cut but it was only sawn halfway through, and then it apparently broke, either by stepping on it or something, to break the bone.
Getting tired, running out of time...
Whatever it was.
MAN:
I'd never had a dismembered headless torso to investigate.
You know, I've investigated my fair share of shootings, homicides...
A whole array of investigations...
Thousands!
But I never had one of these.
So, I knew it was going to be interesting.
I had no idea of what I was fixin' to step into.
If I had of, I'm, I'm not so sure
I would have stepped in so willingly.

MAN:
A teenage boy fishing in the shallow waters off Galveston, Texas, stumbled on the gruesome remains of a murder.
SECOND MAN:
Pretty much everything had washed up, with the exception of the head.
That was the focus of several days of searching.
That's the only body part that was never recovered.
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
One of the most important things that we found initially was a newspaper.
We were able to read an address of 2213 Avenue K.
And the blood that we found on the stair rail, it actually started kind of a trail that came right out here.
And it went in right out to the, to the road.
JONES:
We found out who owned the building.
It was a guy by the name of Klaus Dillman.
Was able to ascertain that the tenant downstairs was an older man named Morris Black that lived in Apartment Number 1.
And then Apartment Number 2, he said, was rented by a little old lady named Dorothy Ciner, who was a mute female.
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
We were able to roll one of the fingerprints from the hand that was in the trash bag.
From that, we were able to identify the victim as Morris Black.
[Camera shutter clicks]
BENNETT:
It appeared that in the common hallway, someone had wiped up blood which led into Apartment 2, which helped me to gain a search warrant into Apartment 2.
JONES:
What we observed then was a pretty pristine apartment.
Very neat.
What was unusual was on the floor of the kitchen were drop cloths.
Once we got the drop cloths pulled up from the floor, we found some real small cuts.
What I wound up doing was to actually take and cut that entire area out.
That's when I found a bloodstain.
We were actually able to match the blood back to Morris Black, so we knew that that's the location where he had been dismembered.
CAZALAS:
When we first talked to the landlord, he said,
"Well, there's a lady that rents Apartment Number 2, but she's never there because she travels all the time."
And I'm thinking to myself...
"Well, if she's got the money to travel all the time,
"and she's gone for months on end, what's she doing living in this dump?"
Ha!
In fact, it was kind of described as a real ugly deaf mute woman.
[Chuckles]
CAZALAS:
There was very little personal items in the apartment.
There was nothing to suggest a woman lived there.
CAZALAS:
Red flags started coming up.
A mute female that travels a lot.
But a guy will be coming around every now and then.
Well, I'm thinking, "Well, there's no Dorothy Ciner,
"that's just a cover.
This guy is renting this place for whatever reason."
[Birds cooing]
JONES:
The next step was to go through the trash can in the alley behind the house.
Every piece of trash was taken out, photographed, labeled, catalogued.
JONES:
It was an appointment receipt, and on that contained information that gave us a date and time in which some eyeglasses were to be picked up.
CAZALAS:
Now I'm thinking, "Who's Robert Durst?"
Still a bunch of question marks.
I take the receipt to the eye clinic.
Ask them if they know who Robert Durst is.
The lady up front said, "Yeah, he was supposed to pick those glasses up on Friday."
I'm thinking, "Vegas wouldn't touch these odds this guy's going to show up."
But I said, "If he shows up, here's my card.
Here's my pager number." And I left.
JONES:
In the trash bags, we also found a price tag from Chalmers Hardware, which was two blocks away from where Morris Black lived.
BENNETT:
Among the things that were bought from Chalmers were a 4-inch paring knife and drop cloths with the Chalmers tags on it.
CAZALAS:
Also bought at Chalmers was a bow saw.
Lo and behold, my pager goes off.
And I'm like...
and I recognized that number.
But I, I haven't, in my mind I didn't connect the dots yet.
And then they had put in "911." I'm thinking, "Who is that?"
Then, bam!
"That's the eye clinic."
I jump in my car and I'm coming up 21st Street.
And he pulls out of the alleyway parking lot right in front of me, and pulls up to the red light, and I'm right behind him.
[Siren wailing]
CAZALAS:
Our Motor Division pulls him over, and we detain him.
JONES:
I recall pulling up to that, and I walked up and glanced down through the back windshield.
And the first thing I saw was a bow saw.
Kind of got that grin.
Saying, "Yeah, we got him."
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Camera shutter clicks]
BURROWS:
Initial impressions when I saw him being brought in was like, "Really?
This guy?
Did that?
Didn't fit."
[Camera shutter clicks]
CAZALAS:
God, the guy looks like a librarian!
He doesn't look like a person that would dismember a human being.
I explained to him he'd been arrested for, you know, homicide.
"Your bond has been set at $250,000."
And he asked me, he said, "Well, what should I do?"
And I said, "I don't know.
Do you have $250,000?"
And he just calmly looked at me and he goes, "Well, not on me."
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Camera shutter clicks]
JONES:
Who the hell is this guy to give you that type of an answer?
Which is not the type of answer you would normally hear.
CAZALAS:
I get a call from the desk sergeant at the jail.
He goes, "Cody, this Durst guy,
"he made a phone call to somebody named
"Debrah in New York.
"Told them he was in Galveston, Texas,
"under arrest for murder, and he needed $250,000.
And she said, "No problem, it will be there in the morning."
And I'm thinking, "What's going on here?"
[Buzzer]
MAN:
Are you the wife of Robert Durst?
Yes.
When did you marry him?
December 2000.
Would that have been December 11, 2000?
- Yes.
- OK.
When did you first hear that Mr. Durst had rented an apartment in Galveston, Texas?
Um, I heard that he rented an apartment in Galveston, Texas certainly after October 9, 2001.
OK.
And why are you so definite about that date?
Because that was the day he called me, after he was arrested.
And I never even heard of Galveston, Texas.
When he called you, where was he calling from?
Jail.
How long was it from the time that he was arrested until he got out of jail on bail?
- 24 hours.
- OK.
When he got out, where did he go?
[Laughs] I'm in New York.
He's in Galveston.
He probably went to the bail bondsman's office first.
And then he probably went home.
Do I know?
Was I there?
I wasn't there.
CAZALAS:
I'm back at work the next morning about 7:30.
I get to my office.
Usually on my phone there may be one or two messages.
I get to, I get my cup of coffee,
I sit down, my light's blinking.
21 messages.
That's when the information about who Robert Durst really was started coming into play.
We get this tip that a Bob Durst has been arrested in Galveston and he's murdered his, his neighbor or something.
And it was like, "Holy shit!
Can this be our Bob Durst?"
The fact that Morris Black had been murdered in Galveston was not something that would have garnered any attention at our end.
It was only when they made the connection to Robert Durst.
CAZALAS:
You find out that he belongs to one of the richest families in New York City.
But that's not strange enough, the guy's also suspected in his wife's disappearance in New York.
MAN:
Robert Durst first made headlines after he reported his wife missing in 1982.
And to this day, the case remains unsolved.
The family of Kathleen Durst, from the beginning, had said they believed Robert Durst was responsible.
He had always maintained his innocence.
Family sources tell News Channel 4
Robert Durst relocated to Galveston, Texas, but they were unsure what he was doing there.
WOMAN:
How many office buildings does the Durst Organization currently own?
Nine.
And can you tell me what those office buildings are?
655 Third Avenue, 675 Third Avenue, 205 East 42nd Street, 733 Avenue of the Americas,
825 Avenue of the Americas, Four Times Square, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, 1155 Avenue of the Americas, and 114 West 47th Street.
Most defendants charged with murder show up at their arraignment, OK?
Did I expect him to be there?
Of course I did.
I wanted to eyeball this guy.
I wanted to size him up.
CAZALAS:
Robert was due to be in court at 10:00 a.m.
And he was a no-show.
He decided to run.
In the search for Robert Durst, a lawyer is asking him to surrender.
Attorney Michael Kennedy made an appeal to him to turn himself in.
KENNEDY:
Robert, if you see this or hear this, please come home.
You have loved ones who care about you here in New York.
Your family is solidly, unifiedly behind you.
The Trust has the wherewithal to pay for your legal defense.
WOMAN:
The press reported that you had hired a bodyguard to protect yourself against Robert Durst.
Is that true?
- That is true, yes.
- MAN:
Objection.
WOMAN:
Did you believe your life was threatened by Robert Durst?
At that point in time...
Robert's actions were bizarre, and while I wasn't sure,
I felt that, to protect my family was a reasonable action to take.
WOMAN:
And when did you hire the, the bodyguard?
In, uh, after Robert jumped bail in Texas.
JONES:
All the wheels started turning.
How do we find this guy?
Everything from state and local agency notifications to notifications to Interpol.
There's no telling where this guy could have gone.
MAN:
A private investigator told a Galveston newspaper that Durst has used false names in the past.
He had disguised himself as a woman.
His alias, Dorothy Ciner, is even listed on the FBI's 10 most wanted list.
CAZALAS:
Dorothy Ciner was somebody he went to
Scarsdale High School with.
We found a bank account that he had set up as Emilio Vignoni.
He had rented a car from a place in Mobile, Alabama, saying he was Morris Black.
And we know there were probably more.
He's not crazy.
He's diabolical.
BAGLI:
When Bob didn't show up at his hearing and we realize he's on the run,
I was as curious as anyone else about where he was.
And so, I was calling places where he had lived.
"When Robert A. Durst returned to
"South Salem in Westchester County,
"a neighbor noticed him seemingly lost in thought
"on a dock at Lake Truesdale,
"behind the tree-shrouded stone cottage he once shared with his wife Kathleen."
"It was his birthday and their wedding anniversary,
"though she had vanished 19 years earlier.
"The State Police and the Westchester District Attorney
"had been seeking him for a year
"to go over his account of his last night with his wife...
"The night she vanished.
"Mr. Durst's reverie on the dock
"suddenly ended when a neighbor strolled down to the lakefront."
That neighbor, of course, was the woman that moved into the house that Bob had lived in, and that Kathie had disappeared from.
It was always piecing together these shreds of information.
It was hazy, but it began to tell a story about this guy who, of course, was an enigma.
WOMAN: 58-year-old Robert Durst was arrested here at Wegmans Grocery Store in Hanover Township after allegedly trying to steal a hoagie.
JONES:
I think we were kind of in the same boat as everybody else that had any knowledge of this case whatsoever.
How in the hell could he have been that stupid?
MAN:
He just kind of got cold look.
All the color ran out of his face, and he just stared at me, and he said, "I'm not saying another word until I speak to an attorney."
MAN:
Police searched his rental car outside...
[Camera shutter clicks]
MAN:
And found two loaded guns, [Camera shutter clicks] some marijuana, [Camera shutter clicks]
$38,000 in cash, and an I.D. for one "Morris Black."
BAGLI:
Why would a guy with $520 in his pocket and $37,000 in the trunk walk into a Wegmans and steal a sandwich?
The guy is crying out to be arrested, isn't he?
On the other hand, he's also a guy that sort of walks through life and thinks he can do whatever he wants to do.
And most of the time, he could.
WOMAN:
In shackles and under heavy guard, 58-year-old Robert Durst is led into the courtroom.
SECOND WOMAN:
Mr. Durst, are you going to fight extradition?
MAN:
He has no comment at this time.
Are you competent to stand trial?
He has no comment.
WOMAN:
Where is your wife?
MAN:
How long was he in jail in Pennsylvania?
DEBRAH:
About two months.
Did you speak to him while he was in jail?
Sure.
Did you call him?
It doesn't work that way.
OK.
He called you from jail in Pennsylvania?
- Yes.
- OK.
During that time, did he call you regularly?
Yes.
And in any of those conversations, did he indicate what his plans were in the future?
Since I'm sure that you know that those conversations were taped, and they probably are public, you could read for yourself, because I don't really remember what conversations we had.
DURST ON TAPE:
It's very cold in this prison.
DEBRAH ON TAPE:
Yeah, cold out.
DURST:
Well, it's cold out, but I feel like it's cold in this prison.
I'm sitting here all covered with a sweatshirt.
Some guys were quote unquote "in paper."
DEBRAH:
I know that.
You told me.
Honey, now when you're now sitting in your room, do you wear that thing or not?
DURST:
Sometimes I do.
Sometimes I don't.
It's very warm.
It is comfy.
I never wore a jumpsuit until I got here.
It's a very comfy thing.
It's easy to take on and off.
Right now, I'm out here in the thing and I have it on o-o-over my l-l-long johns.
And a sweatshirt.
And it's still cold.
MAN:
The time now is approximately 10:34 a.m.
We're on record.
WOMAN:
I'm going to swear you in, sir, if you raise your right hand, please.
Do you solemnly swear or affirm the testimony you are about to give to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Yes, ma'am.
MAN:
Will you state your full name for the record, please?
Robert Durst.
Am I correct that from the 1970s until 1994, you worked in the Durst Family business?
Sort of, yes.
What were your positions there?
- My titles?
- Yes.
I had various important-sounding titles, but I didn't really go there very much.
WOMAN:
Can you tell me under what circumstances
Robert left the Durst Organization in the mid Nineties?
At some point, Robert stopped showing up for, stopped showing up to the office.
And did you ever make any inquiries why he stopped showing up at the office?
I, I did, yes.
And what did you find out?
At that time, he would not talk to me.
MAN:
Did you quit the family business in 1994 after Douglas Durst was picked to run the family businesses?
Well, he was pretty much picked in 1989-90, I remember.
Who picked him?
Uh, the senior generation...
Seymour Durst, David Durst, Roy Durst.
And Seymour Durst was your father?
Yes.
MAN:
In fact, Mr. Durst, you've threatened to kill your brother, haven't you?
- No, sir.
- OK.
DEBRAH:
He screwed you out of everything.
Your birthright.
The entire Durst Organization.
And you forgot?
DURST:
Right.
He took over the family business.
No doubt about it.
DEBRAH:
OK.
He took it from you.
He could have done it with you.
There were a lot of choices he could have done, but no.
He took it from you and his plan was to destroy you and embarrass you.
And he did it.
MAN:
Quote, "The level of enmity is so great that Douglas Durst
"even went so far as to hire a bodyguard to protect himself from Robert Durst."
Close quote.
Do you remember that allegation?
DURST:
I remember that that occurred.
Do you know why Douglas Durst hired a bodyguard?
Because he's a pussy.
Did he hire the bodyguard because he was scared of you?
I have knowledge that he'd hired a bodyguard.
Why he would be scared of me, I have no idea.
MAN:
New York real estate heir Robert Durst will be turned over to Texas authorities this week.
He faces charges in the dismemberment murder of a 71-year-old neighbor.
Yesterday in Pennsylvania, the 58-year-old waived his right to contest his extradition to Texas.
WOMAN ON RECORDING:
It's going to be a media circus there.
DURST ON RECORDING:
I know it is.
I'm trying not to think about it, and I'm trying not to, to plan, what kind of look I should have on my face.
- WOMAN:
I know.
- DURST:
Am I supposed to be smiling?
Or am I supposed to be grim?
WOMAN:
If you're thinking of expression,
I would just have like as close to no expression as you can possibly have...
DURST:
Yeah.
That's what I keep...
The defendant in this case was one who's wanted for a serious crime... murder...
in the state of Texas.
There was a nationwide manhunt for this individual, and it's thanks to the Pennsylvania authorities that he was picked up, arrested, and kept here.
And so we thank the D.A. Morganelli for this.
And with respect to the New York case and in response to your question, let me just say that the disappearance of Kathleen Durst 20 years ago is a case that we are actively investigating.
We continue to seek the public's cooperation.
And as time goes on, we're finding that more and more people are cooperating with us.
And we will get to the bottom of what happened to Kathleen Durst, one way or the other.
DURST ON RECORDING:
Now Jeanine Pirro can go to the grand jury and say, "This person is going to be tried for murder in Galveston."
That's going to make it much more likely that they're going to want to indict me for Kathie.
DEBRAH ON RECORDING:
Bob, she hasn't arrested you because she doesn't have anything.
You're going to be all right.
I promise.
- DURST:
OK.
- DEBRAH:
All right.
You got to chin up.
You'll be OK.
- DURST:
Thank you.
- DEBRAH:
I love you, honey.
DURST:
I love you.
- DEBRAH:
Bye.
- DURST:
Bye.
Have your investigators been able to talk to Robert Durst?
No, they have not.
He's represented by an attorney.
As D.A. Morganelli has said, it's the attorneys that we speak to.
MAN:
Do you have any comment on what happened today with your client?
Well, it's very straightforward.
Mr. Durst is anxious to get to Texas to defend himself on the charges pending there.
He has a viable defense, and he wants to raise it.
Therefore, he chose to voluntarily waive extradition and not seek to fight extradition.
And we expect that he'll be moved forthwith to Texas where, with two of my colleagues down there, we'll begin further to prepare his defense.
And that defense would be an insanity defense?
No.
I'm not going to comment on the defense.
MAN:
Did you at any time tell Mr. Durst that you'd divorce him if he retained Michael Kennedy?
Yes.
Why did you say that to him?
Because I didn't trust Michael Kennedy.
I didn't like Michael Kennedy.
MAN:
I'm quoting again from the tapes.
Do you recall your wife threatening
"I won't stand by you anymore," close quote, if Michael Kennedy wasn't fired as your lawyer?
Yes.
Michael Kennedy was the one who was hired by Douglas to represent me.
And I had no intention of hiring Michael Kennedy anyway.
WOMAN:
Robert Durst returned to Texas tonight.
The heir to a Manhattan skyscraper fortune is charged with murdering and dismembering his Galveston neighbor.
Well, I'm Dick DeGuerin.
I've been practicing law since 1965.
Almost all of that time in criminal law.
Either as a prosecutor, where I started, or as a criminal defense lawyer once I saw the light.
MAN:
And then she says, "I will fight for what I want and I will fight you hard," close quote.
[Chuckles] Well, that's Debbie.
MAN:
Do you remember that conversation?
I don't remember that one specifically, but the big argument then was that I wanted to hire
Dick DeGuerin to represent me, and she wanted me to hire Mike Ramsey.
Durst couldn't decide between Ramsey and me, so, he hired both of us.
MAN:
All Good Things, a new feature film, premiered at the SVA Cinema in Chelsea.
The film was inspired by one of the most notorious missing persons cases in New York City history.
MAN:
Andrew, what brought you to this film?
Well, I'm always interested in, interested in these sort of monster stories.
You know, you find out that somebody is described as a maniac or a crazy person or a, a serial killer, and I always think that those people started out somewhere.
You know, they started out as people, and they had hopes and dreams.
He was an unusual person.
So, he did unusual things.
Stranger than fiction, in a lot of ways.
I remember this case because it's based on one of the great murder mysteries.
There was a man named Robert Durst who came from a very wealthy real estate family.
He married a beautiful woman named Kathie.
Played by you, and then in 1982, khht, she was gone.
Nobody has ever found the body.
He was never charged with the murder.
He's still alive.
I remember saying to my partner,
"I would like to make a movie
"that Robert Durst himself could
"sit and watch, and have an emotional reaction to."
A call comes through.
And I pick it up.
And a sort of smaller voice on the line says, "Hello.
I-I-Is this Eamonn Bowles?"
So I said, "Yes."
He goes, "Oh, this is Bob Durst."
[Laughs] My blood froze.
I went like, "Um, oh, hello, excuse me.
Who is this?
I thought this was someone else.
Who's calling?"
And he's like, "This is Bob Durst.
I'm looking for Andrew Jarecki." And I'm like, "Oh!"
[Telephone ringing]
DURST ON RECORDING:
Hello?
JARECKI ON RECORDING:
Hi.
Mr. Durst?
DURST:
Hi, Mr. Jarecki.
How are you?
JARECKI:
I'm good.
How are you?
DURST:
Good.
I just saw the movie.
So, I h-h-have an idea.
I've no idea if it makes any sense.
But, but you're the one to talk to about it.
- JARECKI:
Sure.
- DURST:
Would it make sense for as in some capacity there to be an interview with me related to what's in the movie?
JARECKI:
Yeah, I think that's a fascinating idea.
I'll be in touch soon.
I'm glad that we had a chance to talk.
DURST:
All righty.
Bye-bye.
JARECKI:
Nice to talk to you.
[Hangs up]
[Telephone ringing]
DURST ON RECORDING:
Mr. Jarecki.
- JARECKI ON RECORDING:
How are you?
- DURST:
Good.
How are you?
JARECKI:
Good.
I think you should feel free to call me "Andrew," by the way.
DURST:
Andrew, how are you?
I have over the years been approached by all the various interview shows.
And I'm not interested in doing a "True Crime" kind of stuff.
JARECKI:
Right.
DURST:
You know more about Robert Durst than any of those people do.
JARECKI:
I guess the question is, you know, has anybody really done a piece on you where they didn't walk into it with a very strong assumption?
One possibility is to have me interview you after having made this film.
DURST:
I would tend to cooperate with you with whatever it was you're going to do.
You, you've got all my phone numbers.
I look forward to hearing from you.
JARECKI:
Sounds good.
Talk to you soon.
DURST:
Bye-bye.
[Static]
DeGUERIN:
As a criminal defense lawyer, you don't always get the truth.
I'm not naive enough to think that you do.
But you try to make a judgment of whether you're getting the truth.
CAZALAS:
When you only have a murderer's word for what happened, why believe anything that comes out of the man's mouth?
DeGUERIN:
What I need to say to you is that I believe Bob, and I believed him from the very beginning.
CAZALAS:
I don't think Bob Durst is the kind of man that kills for the thrill of the kill.
I don't think he takes any particular pleasure in killing.
But if you back him in a corner, if you threaten his freedom, he'll kill ya.
I feel like there should be an app that analyzes your tum and tells you what you want to eat.
Yeah, but...
if the app could do that, you're basically saying it could read your mind.
Yeah, I guess.
But, dude, you think that's a good idea?
I mean, what if it gets in the wrong hands?
It could do some malicious shit.
Thinking about the military, some corporate espionage.
Do you really want to risk all that?
Yeah.
Think about all the pain and suffering it could end.
Like right now.
I want something to eat, but I don't know what.
Dude, I'm hungry too.
Let's eat.
I'm good with whatever.
Why do people always say that?

Please be honest with me.
I got really freaked out when we were at Larry and Andrea's wedding.
Just hearing the vows and thinking about marriage and all that stuff, it just-- It just freaked me out.
-Why?
-I don't know.
I feel like when you're younger, in your 20s, the road ahead in your life, it's not as clear.
You don't know where it's going.
There's turns you don't expect.
There's surprises.
And then as you get older, the road just becomes a little bit clearer, and you just know where you're gonna go, and there's less surprise and less excitement, and you see what's ahead.
So what are you saying?
That our relationship isn't exciting enough?
No, I'm just saying, at this age, it's really intense.
Whatever you're doing in your life, whoever you're with, that's maybe it, you know?
And it's a lot of pressure.
Okay, I get that.
But are you saying that you're not sure you want to be with me?
No, I'm not saying that.
Because it sounds like that's what you're saying.
It sounds like you're not sure you want to be with me and that you don't like the road and you don't fucking want to do this or something.
No, but even if I wasn't sure, does that make me a horrible person?
Or what, are you, like, 100% sure about everything?
You have no doubts, no fears?
No, I'm not 100% sure.
Well, what percentage sure are you?
Hey, why don't we just-- Why don't we just write it down?
It'll be an interesting experiment.
Really?
You want to write it down?
The percentage I think we're gonna be together?
That's a horrible idea.
Why don't we just have a conversation?
Because I tried to have a conversation, and you just started getting mad at me.
Okay, fine, yeah, let's write it down.
Eighty?
Seventy?
What?
Seventy is a high number.
It's not as high as 80, the number I wrote.
And I love that you wrote that down, but 70 is just as high.
No, if there's a movie on Rotten Tomatoes and it has a 70%, people say it has mixed reviews, and I definitely don't go see it.
So you're saying that if our relationship was a movie, you wouldn't go see it.
I was being conservative.
I didn't want to go super high and you go low.
What does it even matter?
Shouldn't we have both written 100 right away without even thinking about it?
Larry and Andrea were at 100.
That exists.
If we're not at 100, we're writing fucking 70 and 80, why are we even doing this?
Well, seems like you've really done the math on our relationship.
You know what?
I think I should go stay at Melinda's for a little bit.
Oh, wait, so now you're just leaving?
You're leaving the apartment?
Yeah, because I'm 100% sure
I don't want to be around you right now.
Oh, my God, Cap.
That game sounds horrible.
Why would you do that?
I don't know.
Seemed like a good idea at the time.
I was actually psyched when I thought of it.
I may have to steal that for a breakup move.
Definitely got Rachel pissed very quickly.
So are you guys really broken up?
I'm not sure.
It was left kind of vague.
She's just staying at her friend's place for a few days.
Yeah, I mean, at the heart of what you were trying to do with that game is not wrong.
I mean, you're not 22.
If you're gonna be in a relationship, you got to dive in.
You don't want to be messing around, so maybe it's good it came up now.
Maybe.
Hopefully, we just need a couple of days, and we can sort it all out.
When you close your eyes, do you see Dev and Rachel in a cozy house with little Devs running around, or do you see Dev out on the town with brand-new ladies?
I just see black.
Oh, God.
End of days.
"I saw life branching out before me, like the green fig tree in the story.
From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked.
One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet, and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantine and Socrates and Attila
and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out.
I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.
I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black.
One by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."
Hey.
Hey, how are you?
Could we meet up and talk?
Yeah, I think we should.
Hey.
Hey.

Dev, I'm moving to Tokyo.
What?
Why are you doing this?
I thought things were going fine, and then I started to think about what you said about how we're on this path, and you're kind of right.
And then I thought about my sister and how she always wanted to live in Paris, and now she's never going to.
And if I don't do this now, I don't think I ever will.
Have you really thought this through?
What are you gonna do for work?
You don't speak Japanese or anything.
I don't know.
I'll figure something out.
Look, I love you, but I want to do this.
This is important to me.
I don't want to wake up one day and wonder,
"What would it have been like if I went to Japan?"
I always play it safe, and I can't do it anymore.
The time in our life to do crazy shit is winding down, and I don't want to wake up one day and see that the window is already closed.
I'm sorry.
Really, really sorry.
Dude, I can't believe they cut both of us out of the movie entirely.
Yeah.
That happened to me on The Cookout 3.
The whole subplot of me beating Marquise at the pie-eating contest got scrapped.
So how you doing?
Well, in addition to that whole mess, my lady kind of left me.
-She moved to Japan.
-Wow.
She got as far away from you as possible.
Yeah.
That-
- That sucks.
I did this thing where I had each of us write down what percent out of 100 we thought that we'd be the last people we'd be together with.
Did not go well.
No, it wouldn't.
That's a horrendous idea.
Why would you do that?
I don't know.
That's so, so ill-advised.
Really stupid.
What did she write?
Seventy.
Seventy is not bad.
Seventy is not good.
That's a C-minus.
It's horrible.
A 20 or a 30, that's bad.
Seventy is decent.
It's like... you passed.
Shouldn't you be at 100, though?
I went to this friend's wedding, and they did their vows, and it was incredible, you know?
And I know, like, vows are super romantic or whatever, but still, it...
It seemed like they were at 100.
That's a nice story, but nobody is at 100.
I mean, I'm in a great marriage, and sometimes we're at 90.
Other times, we're at, like, 20 or 30.
It goes up and down.
It's not just, like, one number all the time.
Oh, my God.
Are you the dude from the Mucinex commercial?
Yeah, that's me.
Oh, no shit.
Dude, oh, my God.
You were the booger.
Oh, no, not Mucinex!

I don't know what to do.
Long-term relationships are tough.
You can't just expect a big roaring fire right away, right, you know?
You can't put the big logs in first.
You got to start with the small stuff, the kindling, right?
And you add that, then you put in the big logs, and then you have a roaring fire, and that's a good relationship, right?
But be careful.
Sometimes kindling wood is hard to find, you know, good wood, so don't take it for granted.

Are you ready to give up an idealistic search for a soul mate and try to make it work with Rachel so you can move forward with your life?
I do.
And do you, Rachel, promise to make a crazy eternal bond with this gentleman who you happen to be dating at this stage in your life when people normally get married?
I do.
I now pronounce you two people who might realize they've made an unfortunate mistake in about three years.
Now you're not sure about Rachel?
I thought you were living together.
Everything was going good.
What's the problem?
I don't know.
It's just intense, you know?
I mean, whoever you're dating now at this age could be who you end up with.
It's a big decision.
It's hard.
Po-da-po.
You are so indecisive.
When you were a kid, you said,
"Dad, can I play soccer?
Can I play tennis?
Can I play basketball?"
Me, I'm so decisive.
I play golf.
I chose your mom.
We got married right away, no problem.
Yeah, but that's totally different.
It was an arranged marriage.
How many women did you meet before you decided on Ma?
-Two.
-Two?
That's it?
What was wrong with the first lady?
She was a little bit too tall.
As soon as she stood up, I was like, "Oh, no."
You have to learn to make decisions, man.
You are like woman sitting in front of the fig tree staring at all the branches till the tree dies.
Wait, what woman?
What tree?
Sylvia Plath, Bell Jar.
You never read.
You're always on the YouTube.
Playing tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
All right.
Look, you are a young man.
You can do a lot of things with your life:
career, girlfriend, travel.
You can even start a family.
But you have to make the decision and do something about it.
If you don't, you're doing nothing, and the tree dies.
Go to the bookstore and get that book.
Oh, while you are there, can you get me the Harry Potter books?
Isn't it a little late in the game to get into Harry Potter?
I heard it's good.
All right.
Oh, shit.
I got to go to the hospital.
Somebody got a chicken bone in their throat.
All right, well, good luck with that.
I'll see you at the premiere.
So tell me about your role.
Um, Dr. Vincent is kind of the heartbeat of the film, you know?
He voices what the audience is thinking.
He's kind of like the Greek chorus or, in my case, the Indian chorus.
All right, well, thanks so much.
Enjoy the film.
Wow, that Indian chorus joke totally killed.
Boom.
What up, playboy?
Dude, this is incredible.
I just bumped into Morris Chestnut, and he told me to get out of his fucking way.
It was great.
-Buddy!
-Yeah!
Congratulations, man.
I'm so proud of you.
Listen, I got you a little present to help celebrate your big day.
Whoa.
This a copy of Us Weekly?
Yeah, you're a Hollywood big shot now.
You got to know what people are saying about you.
Whoa, I'm in this?
No, but there's a great article about Hollywood's top ten ugliest calves.
It'll make you feel a lot better about your own.
Thanks, bud.
Man, this is a lot of pomp and circumstance for an empty special effects movie with cardboard characters and no plot.
Hey, take off your theater critic hat and put on your friend hat.
All right, I'll make an exception this one time for you.
Oh, shit.
They're giving out free popcorn.
Really, Brian?
Your friend's in his first role in a big movie, and you're excited about a free $4 thing of popcorn?
I'm excited for both.
Me, too.
Let's go get some.
-This is gonna be awesome.
-I can't wait!
Oh, guys, hold on a second.
I'm not feeling well.
I think the sickening is happening!
Let's do this, baby!
-Whoo!
-Yeah!
Come on!
What the fuck?
They cut me out of the movie entirely?
It's so shitty.
They could have told you before the premiere.
Why did they have you do an interview with Billy Bush?
Hey, Cap, what happened?
Did we go to the wrong movie?
Where were you?
They cut me out, buddy.
Hug time.
You can go tighter.
You won't hurt Arnold.
Dude, look on the bright side.
At least you got paid pretty well.
Not really.
I was mainly doing this for the exposure.
Oh, but you got great stuff for your reel, so that's great.
No, I mean, I don't have access to that footage.
I don't even know how to get it.
Oh, you know what?
It'll still be on your IMDb page, so...
Mm, I don't think it will, because I didn't appear in the movie.
Okay, I'm officially out of silver linings, dude.
Sorry, man.
Where's Ma?
She got sick.
The movie is called Sickening.
She really got sick and went home.
All right, well, she didn't miss anything, anyway.
I was cut out of the movie.
It's okay.
You can always do another Go-Gurt commercial.
It was good.
Yeah, but that was, like, five years ago.
If acting is your passion, you should focus.
"Passion" may be a bit strong of a word.
So why don't you become a lawyer?
What?
No, I'm not gonna become a lawyer.
So what do you want to do?
I don't know.
It's emergency room.
Hey, John.
What's up?
You're kidding.
Cucumber?
Where?
The butthole?
Oh, my goodness.
I'll be there.
What's going on?
Somebody got a cucumber in the butthole.
I have to go and take it out.
Bye.
Do you want to do another shot?
No, I'll just feel like garbage tomorrow.
Oh, shit, there's Todd, the director.
Have you talked to him yet?
No.
Maybe I should go over there and have an awkward conversation and try to figure out what the hell happened.
Yeah.
You know, he should have the decency to tell you why he cut you out.
Hey, man.
Hey, what's up?
Uh, so Dr. Vincent didn't make the cut, huh?
Yeah, I'm sorry, buddy.
You were great, but we had to lose some stuff.
You know, it just kind of sucks, because I invited a lot of my friends and family.
Couldn't you have maybe told me before?
I could have, but I didn't.
Is that all you have to say for yourself?
You're being such a douche.
-All right, all right.
-Okay, why did you cut him out?
Hey, you know, calm down.
People get cut out of things all the time.
Dev's not the first actor to get cut from a movie.
Oh.
You know what, I'm actually glad that he got cut out, because your movie was garbage.
Hey, come on.
Hey, actually, by the way, it was a piece of shit, the movie.
Calm down.
It was fucking shit.
God damn it.
Well, you're charming.
It was nice meeting you.
Enjoy the open bar, which I think you already have.
I'm gonna go hug Dulé Hill, because he's nice, not like you guys.
-What the fuck?
-What?
Mmm.
I can't believe you made this.
See, I knew you'd be a good chef.
Hey.
What's up?
Nothing.
Really?
You sure?
Feels like you're not really in the room right now.
You're just...
Well, how do you want me to eat pasta, like this?
No, I just-- I just want you to be engaged and listen when I talk to you.
Well, maybe I'm just recovering from that horrible disaster of a night I just had.
You remember earlier?
I went to the movie premiere for this movie that I worked on forever, and I got cut out completely?
And then you decided to drunkenly berate the director?
Okay, I'm sorry.
It was coming from a good place.
I'm sorry you got cut out.
It's fine.
But even before that, you've been a little quiet lately.
Is everything okay?
All right.
If you want to get into it, we can.
I'll be honest with you, but, you know, promise not to get mad at me, and we can have a conversation.
I promise.
Please be honest with me.
I got really freaked out when we were at Larry and Andrea's wedding.
Just hearing the vows and thinking about marriage and all that stuff, it just-- It just freaked me out.
-Why?
-I don't know.
I feel like when you're younger, in your 20s, the road ahead in your life, it's not as clear.
You don't know where it's going.
There's turns you don't expect.
There's surprises.
And then as you get older, the road just becomes a little bit clearer, and you just know where you're gonna go, and there's less surprise and less excitement, and you see what's ahead.
So what are you saying?
That our relationship isn't exciting enough?
No, I'm just saying, at this age, it's really intense.
Whatever you're doing in your life, whoever you're with, that's maybe it, you know?
And it's a lot of pressure.
Okay, I get that.
But are you saying that you're not sure you want to be with me?
No, I'm not saying that.
Because it sounds like that's what you're saying.
It sounds like you're not sure you want to be with me and that you don't like the road and you don't fucking want to do this or something.
No, but even if I wasn't sure, does that make me a horrible person?
Or what, are you, like, 100% sure about everything?
You have no doubts, no fears?
No, I'm not 100% sure.
Well, what percentage sure are you?
Hey, why don't we just-- Why don't we just write it down?
It'll be an interesting experiment.
Really?
You want to write it down?
The percentage I think we're gonna be together?
That's a horrible idea.
Why don't we just have a conversation?
Because I tried to have a conversation, and you just started getting mad at me.
Okay, fine, yeah, let's write it down.
Eighty?
Seventy?
What?
Seventy is a high number.
It's not as high as 80, the number I wrote.
And I love that you wrote that down, but 70 is just as high.
No, if there's a movie on Rotten Tomatoes and it has a 70%, people say it has mixed reviews, and I definitely don't go see it.
So you're saying that if our relationship was a movie, you wouldn't go see it.
I was being conservative.
I didn't want to go super high and you go low.
What does it even matter?
Shouldn't we have both written 100 right away without even thinking about it?
Larry and Andrea were at 100.
That exists.
If we're not at 100, we're writing fucking 70 and 80, why are we even doing this?
Well, seems like you've really done the math on our relationship.
You know what?
I think I should go stay at Melinda's for a little bit.
Oh, wait, so now you're just leaving?
You're leaving the apartment?
Yeah, because I'm 100% sure
I don't want to be around you right now.
Oh, my God, Cap.
That game sounds horrible.
Why would you do that?
I don't know.
Seemed like a good idea at the time.
I was actually psyched when I thought of it.
I may have to steal that for a breakup move.
Definitely got Rachel pissed very quickly.
So are you guys really broken up?
I'm not sure.
It was left kind of vague.
She's just staying at her friend's place for a few days.
Yeah, I mean, at the heart of what you were trying to do with that game is not wrong.
I mean, you're not 22.
If you're gonna be in a relationship, you got to dive in.
You don't want to be messing around, so maybe it's good it came up now.
Maybe.
Hopefully, we just need a couple of days, and we can sort it all out.
When you close your eyes, do you see Dev and Rachel in a cozy house with little Devs running around, or do you see Dev out on the town with brand-new ladies?
I just see black.
Oh, God.
End of days.
"I saw life branching out before me, like the green fig tree in the story.
From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked.
One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet, and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantine and Socrates and Attila
and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out.
I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.
I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black.
One by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."
Hey.
Hey, how are you?
Could we meet up and talk?
Yeah, I think we should.
Hey.
Hey.
Your hair's red.
Dev, I'm moving to Tokyo.
What?
Why are you doing this?
I thought things were going fine, and then I started to think about what you said about how we're on this path, and you're kind of right.
And then I thought about my sister and how she always wanted to live in Paris, and now she's never going to.
And if I don't do this now, I don't think I ever will.
Have you really thought this through?
What are you gonna do for work?
You don't speak Japanese or anything.
I don't know.
I'll figure something out.
Look, I love you, but I want to do this.
This is important to me.
I don't want to wake up one day and wonder,
"What would it have been like if I went to Japan?"
I always play it safe, and I can't do it anymore.
The time in our life to do crazy shit is winding down, and I don't want to wake up one day and see that the window is already closed.
I'm sorry.
Really, really sorry.
Dude, I can't believe they cut both of us out of the movie entirely.
Yeah.
That happened to me on The Cookout 3.
The whole subplot of me beating Marquise at the pie-eating contest got scrapped.
So how you doing?
Well, in addition to that whole mess, my lady kind of left me.
-She moved to Japan.
-Wow.
She got as far away from you as possible.
Yeah.
That-
- That sucks.
I did this thing where I had each of us write down what percent out of 100 we thought that we'd be the last people we'd be together with.
Did not go well.
No, it wouldn't.
That's a horrendous idea.
Why would you do that?
I don't know.
That's so, so ill-advised.
Really stupid.
What did she write?
Seventy.
Seventy is not bad.
Seventy is not good.
That's a C-minus.
It's horrible.
A 20 or a 30, that's bad.
Seventy is decent.
It's like... you passed.
Shouldn't you be at 100, though?
I went to this friend's wedding, and they did their vows, and it was incredible, you know?
And I know, like, vows are super romantic or whatever, but still, it...
It seemed like they were at 100.
That's a nice story, but nobody is at 100.
I mean, I'm in a great marriage, and sometimes we're at 90.
Other times, we're at, like, 20 or 30.
It goes up and down.
It's not just, like, one number all the time.
Oh, my God.
Are you the dude from the Mucinex commercial?
Yeah, that's me.
Oh, no shit.
Dude, oh, my God.
You were the booger.
Oh, no, not Mucinex!
Oh!
This is amazing, man.
All right, well, I'm with my friend, so...
Oh, awesome.
Yeah, all right, dude.
He just took a picture of me without asking.
That was rude.
Again, man, sorry about the girlfriend.
That sucks.
Yeah, it's tough, man.
I don't know what to do.
Long-term relationships are tough.
You can't just expect a big roaring fire right away, right, you know?
You can't put the big logs in first.
You got to start with the small stuff, the kindling, right?
And you add that, then you put in the big logs, and then you have a roaring fire, and that's a good relationship, right?
But be careful.
Sometimes kindling wood is hard to find, you know, good wood, so don't take it for granted.
-Blanket, sir?
-Thank you.
Have you ever been before?
Nope, first time.
So what takes you to Italy?
Pasta?
I really like eating it, and I enjoy making it, so a few days ago,
I just decided to pack up all my stuff and move to Italy and go to pasta-making school.
Wow, how long you going for?
I don't know.
Big move.
You just decided just like that?
Just like that.
Henry George Fisher, Baron of Richmond.
- This is Detective Inspector Jack Robinson.
- Inspector.
Causing trouble can't be your only motivation.
There have been unforsaken delays on my financial return.
Someone's after you, aren't they?
You're afraid.
Who did you see?
My father was arguing with him.
I couldn't hear everything they were saying.
What grudge do you hold against my father?
Your father is a dishonourable, deceitful man.
- Does he owe you money?
- Open it!
Miss Fisher, you'd better phone for an ambulance.
Tell them to hurry.
Our human lives are brief and insignificant compared with the universe around us.
Billions of years old, expanding from the moment of its inception and expanding still, forever in flux.
Poppycock!
Everything you said tonight is poppycock.
God made the world in six days, Mr Tode.
Not billions of years.
Close your gab!
Gentlemen, thank you.
When was the last time you scientists read your Bible?
It's not for mankind to solve God's mysteries and he will punish you come Judgement Day!
Mr Tode, I would like to know how, as an Englishman, you obtained your data from the Southern Hemisphere?
Mr Efendi, thank you but I'm afraid we're out of time.
Mr Tode?
- Well, when did he escape?
- Last night.
I was hoping we'd find him by morning.
Where's your father?
Out of harm's way in a guest house in Lilydale.
Cec and Bert are bringing him back this morning.
- Is that wise?
- It's not ideal but his ship sails tomorrow.
We only have to keep him safe for one day.
Where are you, my dear?
Oh, this is more like it.
My rural idyll was wearing very thin.
Inspector.
Baron.
Why the police guard on the door?
Father, you're not here for a change of scenery.
A crazed fugitive is on the loose and your life is in danger.
What fool discharged the man from hospital?
He didn't ask permission, Baron.
Why is this man so fixated on you?
I can't believe he'd follow you across the world because of a gambling dispute.
He's delusional, Phryne.
Who knows why he's holding me to account?
But I promise you, it's not justified.
He murdered two people trying to get to your money, held my household at gunpoint and fatally choked a police officer escaping from hospital last night.
Does this mean anything to either of you?
The Wren Institute of Science.
We found it beside his hospital bed.
Any connection?
None I can think of.
Something about this place or these three men has aroused our escapee's interest.
Excuse me, Inspector.
Constable Collins needs you at the Wren Institute of Science as soon as possible.
Apparently, there's been a murder.
Don't go anywhere!
Victim is Mr Quentin Tode,
English scientist and recipient of last night's Wren Science Prize.
Could've been a struggle.
Looks like he cracked his skull.
Or maybe he fell.
Look here.
Blood.
Would've scattered the papers on the way down.
What about the bruise on the cheek?
If this is the work of our escapee,
- Mr Tode has something in common with my father.
- Astronomy?
My father's interests have always been decidedly Earth-bound.
Mr Tode is an Englishman, like our escapee.
Maybe there's some sort of grudge between them as well.
How curious.
Why would Mr Tode be carrying around a lady's wristwatch with an even curiouser engraving?
'Remember'.
An old love?
Or a new threat.
Getting back to Mr Tode, how did you discover his body?
It was the blue glow.
That's why I was there in the first place.
Then I saw it was coming from Mr Tode.
And, er, what kind of glowing?
Blue, if you were paying attention.
That's when I knew the aliens must've taken his soul, probably through the hole they made in his brain.
Aliens?
You mean, like a Martian?
Yes, son.
They're out there.
Sir, this unidentified figure you saw leaving the grounds, was it a man, like me, or was it a woman, like her?
Neither, I'd say.
Was a darkness round his body but it had a glowing ring round its neck.
What's this?
'The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork.
Psalms XIX.'
Clearly someone trying to prove a point, with all those exclamation marks.
Our escapee didn't strike me as a religious fanatic.
No, and I have trouble reconciling the 'glory of God' with a man who's murdered three times.
Can you hear that music?
Pythagoras could hear the music of the spheres but he was a lot more mathematical than you are.
Listen.
Sounds oriental.
Turkish, perhaps.
Exactly.
Osman Efendi, resident scientist.
How divine.
Miss Phryne Fisher, and this is Inspector Jack Robinson.
Osman Efendi at your service.
- Can I offer you apple tea?
- No, thank you.
That would be lovely.
We're investigating the death of one of your colleagues,
Mr Quentin Tode.
You know anything about it?
- No.
But it has not entirely surprised me
- Why not?
He had not been feeling well since he arrived.
We suspect more than illness, Mr Efendi.
How well did you know Quentin Tode?
Not well, personally, but we were researching the same field and in the quest for truth, all are companions.
What is your area of study?
Measuring the spectre of light between distant celestial bodies.
How interesting.
Fascinating.
- But have you seen this man before?
- He doesn't look familiar.
He's a dangerous man, wanted in relation to more than one investigation.
We suspect he was here at the Institute last night
I can't recall anyone like that.
Can you think of anyone else who may want to harm Mr Tode?
There was a priest who heckled him during his acceptance speech.
- Do you know his name?
- No.
But the head of the Institute, Mr Logan Wren may be able to help you.
If there was an intruder, He wasn't after the prize money.
It's all still there.
£50,000.
That's quite a sum, Mr Wren.
Was it funded from your family bequest?
There is no family, I'm afraid.
I lost my wife, Agnes, many years ago, and I don't hail from wealth but a number of my inventions did very well after I won science awards myself, as a youth.
With that amount of money, the competition must've been fierce.
Did Tode know he was going to win?
He was informed several months ago so he could book his passage from London.
On the Blue Star.
Arrived in Melbourne a week ago.
- What's he been doing in the meantime?
- Continuing his scientific studies.
He was meant to be catching a train to New South Wales last night.
Did he meet with anyone while he was here?
Perhaps this man?
Er...
No.
No.
I don't think Mr Tode knew anyone else in Australia.
- Mr Efendi said he wasn't well.
- He blamed the tropics.
He worked himself into a lather last night after our prize-giving but I put that down to a difficult audience.
Are you referring to the priest who disrupted proceedings?
Yes.
It was the usual farce -- science versus religion.
But at least debate keeps us all passionate.
Does Mr Tode have a wife or lady friend?
Er, not that I'm aware of.
He travelled alone.
I think science was more important to him than mere mortals.
What happens to this prize now?
We'll award it to the runner-up, I suppose.
And who's that?
Osman Efendi could live the rest of his life on that money.
You're telling me that's not motivation for murder?
Well, what about our escapee and the newspaper article?
Perhaps Osman Efendi's connected with him somehow.
- He did hesitate when he looked at his portrait.
- I noticed.
Think we've found proof our fugitive was here, sir.
It was hidden in the grevillea.
Make you sure the whole area's searched thoroughly, Collins.
- Sir.
- What about... (.. the gatekeeper, Hugh?
)
He said he saw a dark figure, sir, dressed in black.
A police officer?
Possibly, but with no feet, and a glowing ring around its neck.
The gatekeeper's convinced it was an alien.
Or someone more ecclesiastical.
Psalms 19.
We had this reading at last Sunday's mass.
- Where did you find this?
- Do you recognise the handwriting, Dot?
It looks a lot like Father O'Leary's.
- Really?
- I know it from our church meetings.
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
Don't worry about that now, Dot.
I have a job for you.
We found this on Mr Tode's person.
'Remember'?
Remember what?
Talk to some jewellers.
Find out about the watch.
It's worn but the engraving looks new.
- Might have some kind of significance.
- Yes, Miss.
Tell me you don't want me tobring in Father O'Leary for questioning.
You're his newest convert, Collins.
Yes, sir.
Ah!
Hugh.
Dot tells me your family is opposed to having the service in a Catholic church.
Er, I'm not here to talk about the wedding, actually, Father.
No?
What, then?
Not last minute doubts in the faith?
No, no.
No, Father.
Er... police business.
Quentin Tode, in fact.
That pompous ignoramus.
When a man insults the glory of God, it's time to let your fists do the talking!
- You hit him?
- Of course I hit him.
In the defence of God.
All I did was set him straight.
He was claiming scientific proof that God's creation...
Please just stick to the facts.
Tell me exactly what happened that night.
Well, I went after him, of course.
I have something for you, Mr Tode!
Words of wisdom from above!
Whatever you have to say, Father, you're wasting your breath.
Science triumphs over God every time.
What blasphemy!
Come back here and say that again!
Come on!
- There is no God.
- How dare you?
!
You stupid man!
I hollered at him to stand up and fight like a man
- but he ran away, like the craven coward that he is.
- Was.
As God is my witness, he was alive when I left him.
Did you see anyone else in the grounds?
Perhaps this man?
He could've been wearing a police uniform.
Only copper I saw was the one that showed me the door and they all look the same to me.
Did you see anyone else at all?
Only that other heathen blasphemer.
What heathen blasphemer?
That other scientist bloke.
Some kind of Arab, I think.
Stood up and had a go and nobody turfed him out, did they?
- Osman Efendi?
- Could be.
Now, I'm gonna be late for mass.
Father, you may not have intended to kill Mr Tode when you punched him but he collapsed a short time afterwards.
Until we know more about the cause of death,
I have to keep you detained.
On what charge?
Pending a possible charge of manslaughter.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Oh, thanks, Constable.
I'll take that.
Any news, Miss?
Oh, nothing yet, Mr B. Where's Cec and Bert?
Guarding the rear lane.
Ah, your Lordship.
Oh, thank you, Mr Butler.
What is it?
News from home, I'd say.
Th...
That's not Mother's handwriting.
It isn't from England.
Who's it from?
Show it to me.
- I'm sure it's not important.
- Then open it.
It's from him, isn't it?
Doesn't say.
It's nothing.
It's nonsense.
Show it to me.
Where's it posted from?
- You don't need to see his ravings.
- What are you doing?
I refuse to be cowered by this man and I refuse to involve you in all this ugliness.
Don't be ridiculous.
That's police evidence!
No!
It's addressed to me, only to me!
- Why aren't you telling me anything?
- How dare you interrogate me!
I'm your father, not one of your criminals!
- Give me the letter!
- No!
- Everything alright, Miss?
- We heard shouting.
We're fine, thank you.
False alarm.
I'm going upstairs to rest.
With my door locked.
You're still a Proddie through and through!
Pismires and spiders be in your marriage bed, if you ever get a priest to marry yer, for I will not!
- He punched a scientist.
- And what's a 'pismire'?
An ant, I think.
I'm not sure I want to be married by a man who punches scientists and curses his parishioners.
Yes, you do, Dottie.
He married your parents.
He christened you.
He confirmed you.
And all the invitations have been sent out.
Don't you worry.
I'll sort it all out...
Mrs Collins.
How'd you go with the jewellers?
It's a wristlet watch made by an English company called Myer Towers before the war.
Popular in Europe but not imported to Australia.
- Someone has brought it with them.
- And anything on the engraving?
The jewellers agreed it was recent but none of them had done it.
The bruising to his face is unremarkable, apart from having being inflicted by a Catholic priest.
What about the head injury?
His skull was definitely fractured when he fell but that's not what killed him.
He was poisoned.
You need to bring my father in for questioning and you have my permission to torture him.
He's received a letter and I know it's from that madman.
- What did it say?
- My father refused to tell me.
It's obviously some kind of blackmail.
Phryne, your house is under constant watch.
Whatever threats were made in that letter, no-one can get near your father or the rest of your household.
I'll bring him in for a formal interview.
Thank you.
You said Tode was poisoned?
I tested for everything I can think of.
I have never seen a poison with this kind of pathology before.
What's so unusual?
There was a caustic path through the nasal passage, down the larynx, into the gut.
Discolouration of the spleen, liver.
Perhaps something stolen from the hospital?
I'll have Collins check if they're missing any supplies while I go through Tode's belongings.
You're perfectly safe, Baron.
Bert and Cec are doing shifts in the rear lane,
Mr Butler's patrolling the front garden and there are policemen on every corner.
It'd be a lot less dangerous for you all if I weren't here.
This should be a joyful time for you.
Hugh and I are joyful enough.
Just our priest who wants to spoil things.
Oh, and Hugh's mother and my mother and probably most of our relatives.
Any chance of a refill for the rear guard dog?
It's just brewing.
Pardon me for asking, Baron, but any idea what this bloke's after, apart from your head on a platter?
Not 100% sure, Albert, but I think a great deal of money would at least keep him at bay.
Seasickness pills, headache, cough tincture, eye drops.
Quentin Tode was clearly a man obsessed by his health.
And scientific research.
He's got more books and papers with him than clothing.
I'll have this sent over to Dr Macmillan and tested for poison.
Jack, look.
This essay, it's by Osman Efendi, not Quentin Tode.
Tode's made notes on all his data.
Slight alterations.
Perhaps Tode had scientific quibbles.
Father O'Leary said Mr Efendi stood up and had a go.
Now, why would he do that?
Excuse me, sir, this was just found hidden in an alcove on the grounds near where we found the police jacket.
It's Turkish.
I can tell by the inscription.
It's only used by members of royalty and I've seen this inscription before on Osman Efendi's tea service.
Oh, good.
Brilliant scientist, talented musician, dashingly handsome and an Ottoman prince.
And now, extremely suspicious.
Anyone see you?
Well done, Baron.
One move and I'll shoot you.
Understand?
Mm-hm.
No.
No, I wouldn't call it scientific theft.
You said Osman Efendi accused Tode of using his data.
Sounds like plagiarism to me.
Well, but that's debatable.
If scientists didn't build on each other's work, then we'd all be making the same discoveries and there would be no progress.
I have a right to defend my work.
I have toiled night after night in the observatory here.
For Tode to appropriate my work is an outrage!
He has never crossed the equator before.
He couldn't possibly have gathered that data.
So you deserve this prize?
And I will have it on Saturday, thanks to fate and by God's grace, insha'Allah.
God's grace also brought you back this.
We know it's yours because it bears a royal tughra, a unique stamp of one of the houses of the Ottoman Empire, the same unique stamp as on your tea tray.
I am grateful for its return.
How did it go missing?
I don't know.
I must've been robbed.
- Why didn't you mention this earlier?
- I hadn't noticed.
A beautiful and expensive object from Turkish royalty goes missing and you fail to notice?
We believe it was in possession of our fugitive,
- the one you denied knowing.
- Did you give this to him?
Did you promise a share of your winnings if he killed Tode for you?
- No!
- But you know who this man is.
Can you give us his name?
Or would you prefer to be arrested as an accessory to murder?
I only knew him as 'Denizci' -- 'sailor' in Turkish'.
We met during the war.
Both our ships were sunk by mines.
- He saved my life.
- What happened to your sailor?
Shell shocked.
The war had broken him.
- But he returned to England?
- Yes.
I begged him to staybut he refused.
When was the last time you saw him?
He came to visit me the night of the prize-giving.
I could not offer him shelter but I gave him what I had.
I told him to sell that for money.
- Where was he headed?
- He didn't say.
But he had nothing to do with Quentin Tode's death.
Do you recognise this?
We found it in Quentin Tode's pocket.
No.
I am sorry.
What date was your ship sunk, Mr Efendi?
18 March, 1915.
This killings you say Denizci's guilty of, were they in self-defence?
No.
No, they were all unarmed.
He murdered them in cold blood.
You're free to go now, Mr Efendi.
Lord Fisher?
Baron?
Have you seen Baron Fisher, Mr Butler?
- Not upstairs resting?
- No.
I've looked everywhere.
Dottie!
Mr B!
Out here!
Bert!
Wake up!
Where's the cab?
Somebody hit me with a bloody truck.
Try naval records for officers that went down that day in the Dardanelles.
Least we might narrow it down to this 'Denizci'.
- Do we know what Tode was poisoned with yet?
- This just came in, sir.
All medicines in Mr Tode's possession were harmless.
- No sign of poison.
- Thank you.
I'm off now, sir.
Oh.
I'll get that.
You go ahead.
Thank you, sir.
City South.
Yes.
Yes, Miss Fisher is right here.
Miss Williams for you.
Dot?
How?
I'll be right home.
My father has managed to escape his house arrest.
His letter was with the rest of the mail this afternoon.
It could've been stolen and altered at any stage.
Who knows how long this man's been lurking.
Poor Baron.
He thought he was putting us all in danger.
This was not a noble gesture, Dot.
It's not in my father's repertoire.
No.
He's up to something.
- With our cab.
- Here, get that into ya.
Nothing else upstairs, Miss, and I've gone through all the rubbish.
Thank you, Mr B.
There's a letter in here, Miss.
Oh, no, that's... .. my mother's handwriting.
'Dear Henry, I can't believe you've gone back to your old ways after all this time, gambling and lying and risking everything we have.
I know that man had something to do with it but you should never have deserted me and my patience has run out.
I have loved you with all my heart, Henry, despite everything, but if you fail to arrive on that ship when it docks at Southampton,
I will be asking for a formal separation.
Your wife, Margaret.
Father O'Leary?
You should know better than to interrupt a discourse with God.
But, if you've come to ask for clemency for your utter stupidity...
- You're glowing, Father.
- Holy light.
The hand of God.
Do you see what miracle is upon me?
Unless there's another explanation.
- What is it, Collins?
- Father O'Leary's collar.
I remember the gatekeeper talking about Mr Tode's eyes and how they glowed in the dark.
I thought he was crazy but then I remembered the eye drops.
But the eye drops in his suitcase were unopened.
He must've had more.
And they came into contact with Father O'Leary's cassock when he attacked Tode in the grounds.
And they could've dropped the bottle in the struggle.
- I'm gonna search the far side.
- Good work, Collins.
- We'll have a look round here.
- Sir.
Turn off your torch, Jack.
If it's still glowing, we'll see it.
Oh, Jack, what if it's my fault?
What if I drove my father away?
I railed against him.
What if...
What if something happens and I never see him again?
Whatever happens to your father, it's not your fault and nothing is going to happen.
Perhaps he has just headed back to England after all.
Well, if it's all expanding, England will move further away.
But it all looks very still to me.
That's because you're not a telescope.
- Is that supposed to be a compliment?
- More like a romantic overture.
- Is that the best that you can do?
- Would you like me to improve on it?
More than anything.
Jack.
Behind you.
What the hell is in that?
His eye drops are not just phosphorescent.
Watch this.
- They're radioactive?
- Highly.
At some point, a lethal dose of polonium has been added to them.
- Polonium?
- Is that like radium?
Related.
Polonium is extremely unstable and highly toxic if ingested.
Our killer could have more of it.
What form would it be in, Mac?
It'd have to be a powder or a liquid form to mix with eye drops.
How dangerous is it, aside from swallowing it?
Both forms are a deadly hazard.
I'll be encasing this lot in lead.
If it's sealed correctly, the radiation itself isn't lethal but, if ingested or inhaled, just a speck of polonium can be deadly.
If the man who is after my father has done this,
I hope to God Father's not brave enough to go after him.
There was a delivery of polonium two weeks ago.
There should be a corresponding order.
Let's see.
Ah.
Here.
It was six weeks ago.
But no name on the order.
Is this your signature?
No, that's Osman Efendi's.
He often signs for deliveries when I'm not here.
Polonium must've stood out as unusual.
I assume it was part of Quentin Tode's research.
Well, who has access to these chemicals?
All of our scientific staff have keys.
It's gone.
Mr Tode's other supplies are still there but there's no sign of the polonium.
I don't understand.
I kept your secret and I gave you money.
- It's what you wanted.
- You broke our promise!
- But we agreed.
- Oh, yes, milord.
Take everything and leave me nothing and then waste it all.
Denizci?
Denizci, it's only me.
Were you followed?
No.
I was careful.
I've come to warn you.
I don't know how much longer I can keep the police at bay.
You need to give yourself up.
Please?
Don't worry about me.
This will all be over soon.
I promise you.
Good luck, Denizci.
Morning, Miss.
You're up early.
I couldn't sleep, Dot.
Today's the day my father's supposed to be boarding that ship.
I said a prayer for him last night, asked God to keep him safe.
I suppose that might assist.
In any case, God's far more likely to listen to you than me.
You said there was a job I could do.
I need you to find out what you can about Tode's scientific work.
Look for any mention of polonium.
This is the chemical symbol, the atomic number -- 84 -- and all the known compounds.
As soon as the Institute opens.
I'm sorry, Dot.
I'm distracting you from your wedding preparations.
Oh, no, Miss.
We're prepared.
But I am beginning to think it might be easier to get married in a registry office, rather than deal with Father O'Leary.
He's not very forgiving, for a Christian.
I think the Irish cancels that out.
Miss Fisher?
We found the cab.
It was dumped at Vic Markets.
What else?
This was left behind.
Yes?
I've wrestled with my conscience all night, Miss Fisher.
I owe my life to that man but he has gone mad.
- What is it, Mr Efendi?
- He has a hostage.
It could be the man you're looking for.
It has something to do with an old grudge.You need to stop him.
Do you have an address?
It's hidden at the rear of an old hat factory.
It's called...
Ahhh!
Mr Efendi?
!
I've roamed this Earth like a beggar while you reigned over my life, my home, my history and you dare to sell it for a song!
- The estate?
- Time to pay the price.
Are you gonna kill me?
No.
Your daughter is clever.
She'll come for you soon enough.
But when she does, I'm gonna kill her in front of you.
She won't come.
You don't understand.
I was a drunkard.
I was cruel.
She doesn't care about me.
You're wasting your time.
I know where to get you money, more than your fortune was worth.
The estate can be yours again.
£50,000 in cash.
Where?
Osman knew where he was.
He said something about an old hat factory.
Maybe he wrote it down.
Miss?
I found out more about Mr Tode and polonium.
15 years ago, Mr Tode invented a paint called 'Illumina'.
for Myer Towers, the company that make clocks and watches, same manufacturer as that wristlet watch.
That engraving. 'Remember'.
It must have something to do with that.
Jack!
- Le Bon Vie.
- The good life?
It was a milliners in Fitzroy.
Closed down about a year ago.
Dot, find out what else you can about that paint.
Why don't you try the science journals in the Logan Wren's office?
Jack, this way!
They were here.
Inspector, this just came through from Naval Records.
'March 18, 1915.
Battleship Ocean, Morto Bay, Turkish gunfire...'
'Captain William Eugene Fisher.' It all makes sense.
Eugene Fisher was my father's cousin.
the previous Baron of Richmond-upon-Thames.
He died in the early stages of the war.
He was reported missing, presumed drowned.
What's this?
The prize money.
What if my father's gone after it?
How?
It's in the safe at the Institute.
- Who do you think taught me every shady trick I know?
- Of course.
He's trying to pay his way out of trouble.
Oh, no.
Dot!
Today, we had hoped to celebrate the scientific achievements of Mr Osman Efendi.
He was a man of integrity and brilliance.
Sadly... he cannot be with us.
Gertrude Harris.
Gwynnie Hayes.
- Agnes Wren...
- Hurry up!
Alright!
Better get this right.
Your daughter's life depends on it.
Collins, make sure those men cover every exit and do a sweep of the ground.
- Any sign of Dot?
- No, Miss.
Make sure nobody leaves.
We'll check this gate.
- What's taking so long?
- I'm nearly there.
Just let me think!
Perhaps this will help.
No!
Don't!
- Dot!
- Get back!
All of you!
If you want your father to walk out of here alive,
Miss Fisher, open this safe.
Put down the gun.
The money's all there.
Put it in this bag.
Hurry.
- That's everything.
- Now get back.
Pick up the bag.
You can't kill us all, Eugene.
You were once an honourable man, Eugene.
What happened?
- The war!
That bloody disaster!
- You had a choice.
But you ran away like a coward.
No!
Don't move!
Dottie, are you alright?
Eugene Fisher, we're arresting you for multiple charges of murder and abduction.
Are you alright, Father?
I'll be outside.
- And you, Dot?
- I'm alright, Miss.
Did you find out anything more about that polonium paint?
I found the polonium.
Your wife's watch.
She worked at the Myer Towers watch factory.
The women would lick their brushes to a sharp point.
And that's how they became so ill.
- Four of them died.
- Including your wife.
My beautiful Agnes died far too early because of Quentin Tode's scientific lies so I made sure that he paid a price with his life.
And, I'm afraid to say...
.. I have no regrets.
Why did you hide Eugene from us?
We all thought he'd died during the war.
When he turned up the first time, I couldn't believe it but if I told anyone he would've been court martialled for desertion.
I couldn't have that, not when all he wanted was money.
What about Mother?
Why didn't you tell her?
Because I thought Eugene was satisfied and after losing Janey and all the damage I'd done, I...
It would've been too much for her.
We'd only just left it behind us.
We had money, a beautiful home, a happy future.
I owed her that.
I owed it to you all.
And then Eugene returned.
A few months agoout of the blue.
He told me he'd already killed a man to hide our secret.
'Our secret,' he said, as if I was responsible.
He demanded everything and all I could think of to do was to take the money and run.
I told your mother I'd lost everything in a game of cards.
But I promised to get it back.
Well, you have.
It's all too late.
When she meets my ship, I won't be there and our marriage will be over.
- Is that what you want?
- Oh, God!
No, Phryne.
Your mother... is the love of my life.
I never wanted anyone else.
Well, then, you'd better pack your bags tonight.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
But, Phryne, my ship has sailed.
There are other ways to travel.
Oh, no.
I hate flying!
Good, then you can suffer for love.
Hugh, I could've been shot today.
Don't, Dottie.
Please, don't.
- I can't bear the thought.
- Me either.
So let's not waste time.
Let's get married like we said.
I thought you were joking.
What's the hurry?
Miss Fisher's leaving for England in the morning.
I really don't want her to miss it, Hugh.
Please?
Dottie, are you sure?
It's not gonna be the wedding you wanted.
I love you, Hugh,and I want you.
- Five o'clock tonight?
- You leave it to me, Dottie.
'And God stretcheth out the Heavens as a curtain and spreadeth the mount as a tent to dwell in.
- Isaiah, chapter 40, verse 22.' - 22.
So, in your opinion,
God's behind it all, this expanding universe business?
And phosphorescence and polonium and all the other miracles and probably even aliens, if they exist.
So God invented the miracle of science.
Pretty much.
I don't think I've ever seen you look so pretty, Dot.
That cop's a lucky bloke, alright.
Hang on.
Careful, you two!
So, Dot, are you ready for your biggest adventure?
I won't even close my eyes, Miss.
I, Dorothy Anne Williams, take you, Hugh Theobald Collins, for my lawful husband, to have and to hold from this day forward until death do us part.
- Whoo!
- Dottie!
- Yay!
- Yay!
- Congratulations.
Well done, love.
When I came to work for you, Miss, I was afraid of everything and you taught me so many things and made me brave and you made me happy.
Please come back safely.
Oh, Dot.
Good luck.
- Bye!
- Bye!
Oh, Jack, look!
- Ready, Father?
- No.
We're going to die!
There's no point getting upset in the air.
Very unforgiving element.
Contact.
Get in.
Jack.
What are you doing?
Phryne?
Flying all the way to England in that?
It's the only way I can make sure he'll get there.
For God's sake!
What if this thing takes off?
- Come after me.
- What did you say?
It was a romantic overture.
Say it again.
Come after me, Jack Robinson.
When you two have quite finished...
I always feared another man would sweep you away from me.
I never thought it'd be your father.
There's a whole world out there, Jack.
He's the least of your worries!
Henry George Fisher, Baron of Richmond.
- This is Detective Inspector Jack Robinson.
- Inspector.
Causing trouble can't be your only motivation.
There have been unforsaken delays on my financial return.
Someone's after you, aren't they?
You're afraid.
Who did you see?
My father was arguing with him.
I couldn't hear everything they were saying.
What grudge do you hold against my father?
Your father is a dishonourable, deceitful man.
- Does he owe you money?
- Open it!
Miss Fisher, you'd better phone for an ambulance.
Tell them to hurry.
Our human lives are brief and insignificant compared with the universe around us.
Billions of years old, expanding from the moment of its inception and expanding still, forever in flux.
Poppycock!
Everything you said tonight is poppycock.
God made the world in six days, Mr Tode.
Not billions of years.
- Close your gab!
Gentlemen, thank you.
When was the last time you scientists read your Bible?
It's not for mankind to solve God's mysteries and he will punish you come Judgement Day!
Mr Tode, I would like to know how, as an Englishman, you obtained your data from the Southern Hemisphere?
Mr Efendi, thank you but I'm afraid we're out of time.
Mr Tode?
- Well, when did he escape?
- Last night.
I was hoping we'd find him by morning.
Where's your father?
Out of harm's way in a guest house in Lilydale.
Cec and Bert are bringing him back this morning.
It's not ideal but his ship sails tomorrow.
We only have to keep him safe for one day.
- Where are you, my dear?
Oh, this is more like it.
My rural idyll was wearing very thin.
Inspector.
Baron.
Why the police guard on the door?
Father, you're not here for a change of scenery.
A crazed fugitive is on the loose and your life is in danger.
What fool discharged the man from hospital?
He didn't ask permission, Baron.
Why is this man so fixated on you?
I can't believe he'd follow you across the world because of a gambling dispute.
He's delusional, Phryne.
Who knows why he's holding me to account?
But I promise you, it's not justified.
He murdered two people trying to get to your money, held my household at gunpoint and fatally choked a police officer escaping from hospital last night.
Does this mean anything to either of you?
The Wren Institute of Science.
We found it beside his hospital bed.
Any connection?
None I can think of.
Something about this place or these three men has aroused our escapee's interest.
Excuse me, Inspector.
Constable Collins needs you at the Wren Institute of Science as soon as possible.
Apparently, there's been a murder.
Don't go anywhere!
Victim is Mr Quentin Tode,
English scientist and recipient of last night's Wren Science Prize.
Could've been a struggle.
Looks like he cracked his skull.
Or maybe he fell.
Look here.
Blood.
Would've scattered the papers on the way down.
What about the bruise on the cheek?
If this is the work of our escapee,
- Mr Tode has something in common with my father.
- Astronomy?
My father's interests have always been decidedly Earth-bound.
Mr Tode is an Englishman, like our escapee.
Maybe there's some sort of grudge between them as well.
How curious.
Why would Mr Tode be carrying around a lady's wristwatch with an even curiouser engraving?
'Remember'.
An old love?
Or a new threat.
Getting back to Mr Tode, how did you discover his body?
It was the blue glow.
That's why I was there in the first place.
Then I saw it was coming from Mr Tode.
And, er, what kind of glowing?
Blue, if you were paying attention.
That's when I knew the aliens must've taken his soul, probably through the hole they made in his brain.
Aliens?
You mean, like a Martian?
Yes, son.
They're out there.
Sir, this unidentified figure you saw leaving the grounds, was it a man, like me, or was it a woman, like her?
Neither, I'd say.
Was a darkness round his body but it had a glowing ring round its neck.
What's this?
'The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork.
Psalms XIX.'
Clearly someone trying to prove a point, with all those exclamation marks.
Our escapee didn't strike me as a religious fanatic.
No, and I have trouble reconciling the 'glory of God' with a man who's murdered three times.
- Can you hear that music?
Pythagoras could hear the music of the spheres but he was a lot more mathematical than you are.
Listen.
Sounds oriental.
Turkish, perhaps.
Exactly.
Osman Efendi, resident scientist.
How divine.
Miss Phryne Fisher, and this is Inspector Jack Robinson.
Osman Efendi at your service.
- Can I offer you apple tea?
- No, thank you.
That would be lovely.
We're investigating the death of one of your colleagues,
Mr Quentin Tode.
You know anything about it?
- No.
But it has not entirely surprised me
- Why not?
He had not been feeling well since he arrived.
We suspect more than illness, Mr Efendi.
How well did you know Quentin Tode?
Not well, personally, but we were researching the same field and in the quest for truth, all are companions.
What is your area of study?
Measuring the spectre of light between distant celestial bodies.
How interesting.
Fascinating.
- But have you seen this man before?
- He doesn't look familiar.
He's a dangerous man, wanted in relation to more than one investigation.
We suspect he was here at the Institute last night
I can't recall anyone like that.
Can you think of anyone else who may want to harm Mr Tode?
There was a priest who heckled him during his acceptance speech.
- Do you know his name?
- No.
But the head of the Institute, Mr Logan Wren may be able to help you.
If there was an intruder, He wasn't after the prize money.
It's all still there.
?
50,000.
That's quite a sum, Mr Wren.
Was it funded from your family bequest?
There is no family, I'm afraid.
I lost my wife, Agnes, many years ago, and I don't hail from wealth but a number of my inventions did very well after I won science awards myself, as a youth.
With that amount of money, the competition must've been fierce.
Did Tode know he was going to win?
He was informed several months ago so he could book his passage from London.
On the Blue Star.
Arrived in Melbourne a week ago.
- What's he been doing in the meantime?
- Continuing his scientific studies.
He was meant to be catching a train to New South Wales last night.
Did he meet with anyone while he was here?
Perhaps this man?
Er...
No.
No.
I don't think Mr Tode knew anyone else in Australia.
- Mr Efendi said he wasn't well.
- He blamed the tropics.
He worked himself into a lather last night after our prize-giving but I put that down to a difficult audience.
Are you referring to the priest who disrupted proceedings?
Yes.
It was the usual farce - science versus religion.
But at least debate keeps us all passionate.
Does Mr Tode have a wife or lady friend?
Er, not that I'm aware of.
He travelled alone.
I think science was more important to him than mere mortals.
What happens to this prize now?
We'll award it to the runner-up, I suppose.
And who's that?
Osman Efendi could live the rest of his life on that money.
You're telling me that's not motivation for murder?
Well, what about our escapee and the newspaper article?
Perhaps Osman Efendi's connected with him somehow.
- He did hesitate when he looked at his portrait.
- I noticed.
Think we've found proof our fugitive was here, sir.
It was hidden in the grevillea.
Make you sure the whole area's searched thoroughly, Collins.
- Sir.
- What about... (.. the gatekeeper, Hugh?
)
He said he saw a dark figure, sir, dressed in black.
A police officer?
Possibly, but with no feet, and a glowing ring around its neck.
The gatekeeper's convinced it was an alien.
Or someone more ecclesiastical.
Psalms 19.
We had this reading at last Sunday's mass.
- Where did you find this?
- Do you recognise the handwriting, Dot?
It looks a lot like Father O'Leary's.
- Really?
- I know it from our church meetings.
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
Don't worry about that now, Dot.
I have a job for you.
We found this on Mr Tode's person.
'Remember'?
Remember what?
Talk to some jewellers.
Find out about the watch.
It's worn but the engraving looks new.
- Might have some kind of significance.
- Yes, Miss.
Tell me you don't want me tobring in Father O'Leary for questioning.
You're his newest convert, Collins.
Yes, sir.
Ah!
Hugh.
Dot tells me your family is opposed to having the service in a Catholic church.
Er, I'm not here to talk about the wedding, actually, Father.
No?
What, then?
Not last minute doubts in the faith?
No, no.
No, Father.
Er... police business.
Quentin Tode, in fact.
That pompous ignoramus.
When a man insults the glory of God, it's time to let your fists do the talking!
- You hit him?
- Of course I hit him.
In the defence of God.
All I did was set him straight.
He was claiming scientific proof that God's creation...
Please just stick to the facts.
Tell me exactly what happened that night.
Well, I went after him, of course.
I have something for you, Mr Tode!
Words of wisdom from above!
Whatever you have to say, Father, you're wasting your breath.
Science triumphs over God every time.
What blasphemy!
Come back here and say that again!
Come on!
- There is no God.
- How dare you?
!
You stupid man!
I hollered at him to stand up and fight like a man
- but he ran away, like the craven coward that he is.
- Was.
As God is my witness, he was alive when I left him.
Did you see anyone else in the grounds?
Perhaps this man?
He could've been wearing a police uniform.
Only copper I saw was the one that showed me the door and they all look the same to me.
Did you see anyone else at all?
Only that other heathen blasphemer.
What heathen blasphemer?
That other scientist bloke.
Some kind of Arab, I think.
Stood up and had a go and nobody turfed him out, did they?
- Osman Efendi?
- Could be.
Now, I'm gonna be late for mass.
Father, you may not have intended to kill Mr Tode when you punched him but he collapsed a short time afterwards.
Until we know more about the cause of death,
I have to keep you detained.
On what charge?
Pending a possible charge of manslaughter.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Oh, thanks, Constable.
I'll take that.
Any news, Miss?
Oh, nothing yet, Mr B. Where's Cec and Bert?
Guarding the rear lane.
Ah, your Lordship.
Oh, thank you, Mr Butler.
What is it?
News from home, I'd say.
Th...
That's not Mother's handwriting.
It isn't from England.
Who's it from?
Show it to me.
- I'm sure it's not important.
- Then open it.
It's from him, isn't it?
Doesn't say.
It's nothing.
It's nonsense.
Show it to me.
Where's it posted from?
- You don't need to see his ravings.
- What are you doing?
I refuse to be cowered by this man and I refuse to involve you in all this ugliness.
Don't be ridiculous.
That's police evidence!
No!
It's addressed to me, only to me!
- Why aren't you telling me anything?
- How dare you interrogate me!
I'm your father, not one of your criminals!
- Give me the letter!
- No!
- Everything alright, Miss?
- We heard shouting.
We're fine, thank you.
False alarm.
I'm going upstairs to rest.
With my door locked.
You're still a Proddie through and through!
Pismires and spiders be in your marriage bed, if you ever get a priest to marry yer, for I will not!
- He punched a scientist.
- And what's a 'pismire'?
An ant, I think.
I'm not sure I want to be married by a man who punches scientists and curses his parishioners.
Yes, you do, Dottie.
He married your parents.
He christened you.
He confirmed you.
And all the invitations have been sent out.
Don't you worry.
I'll sort it all out...
Mrs Collins.
How'd you go with the jewellers?
It's a wristlet watch made by an English company called Myer Towers before the war.
Popular in Europe but not imported to Australia.
- Someone has brought it with them.
- And anything on the engraving?
The jewellers agreed it was recent but none of them had done it.
The bruising to his face is unremarkable, apart from having being inflicted by a Catholic priest.
What about the head injury?
His skull was definitely fractured when he fell but that's not what killed him.
He was poisoned.
You need to bring my father in for questioning and you have my permission to torture him.
He's received a letter and I know it's from that madman.
- What did it say?
- My father refused to tell me.
It's obviously some kind of blackmail.
Phryne, your house is under constant watch.
Whatever threats were made in that letter, no-one can get near your father or the rest of your household.
I'll bring him in for a formal interview.
Thank you.
You said Tode was poisoned?
I tested for everything I can think of.
I have never seen a poison with this kind of pathology before.
What's so unusual?
There was a caustic path through the nasal passage, down the larynx, into the gut.
Discolouration of the spleen, liver.
Perhaps something stolen from the hospital?
I'll have Collins check if they're missing any supplies while I go through Tode's belongings.
You're perfectly safe, Baron.
Bert and Cec are doing shifts in the rear lane,
Mr Butler's patrolling the front garden and there are policemen on every corner.
It'd be a lot less dangerous for you all if I weren't here.
This should be a joyful time for you.
Hugh and I are joyful enough.
Just our priest who wants to spoil things.
Oh, and Hugh's mother and my mother and probably most of our relatives.
Any chance of a refill for the rear guard dog?
It's just brewing.
Pardon me for asking, Baron, but any idea what this bloke's after, apart from your head on a platter?
Not 100% sure, Albert, but I think a great deal of money would at least keep him at bay.
Seasickness pills, headache, cough tincture, eye drops.
Quentin Tode was clearly a man obsessed by his health.
And scientific research.
He's got more books and papers with him than clothing.
I'll have this sent over to Dr Macmillan and tested for poison.
Jack, look.
This essay, it's by Osman Efendi, not Quentin Tode.
Tode's made notes on all his data.
Slight alterations.
Perhaps Tode had scientific quibbles.
Father O'Leary said Mr Efendi stood up and had a go.
- Now, why would he do that?
Excuse me, sir, this was just found hidden in an alcove on the grounds near where we found the police jacket.
It's Turkish.
I can tell by the inscription.
It's only used by members of royalty and I've seen this inscription before on Osman Efendi's tea service.
Oh, good.
Brilliant scientist, talented musician, dashingly handsome and an Ottoman prince.
And now, extremely suspicious.
Anyone see you?
Well done, Baron.
One move and I'll shoot you.
Understand?
Mm-hm.
No.
No, I wouldn't call it scientific theft.
You said Osman Efendi accused Tode of using his data.
Sounds like plagiarism to me.
Well, but that's debatable.
If scientists didn't build on each other's work, then we'd all be making the same discoveries and there would be no progress.
I have a right to defend my work.
I have toiled night after night in the observatory here.
For Tode to appropriate my work is an outrage!
He has never crossed the equator before.
He couldn't possibly have gathered that data.
So you deserve this prize?
And I will have it on Saturday, thanks to fate and by God's grace, insha'Allah.
God's grace also brought you back this.
We know it's yours because it bears a royal tughra, a unique stamp of one of the houses of the Ottoman Empire, the same unique stamp as on your tea tray.
I am grateful for its return.
How did it go missing?
I don't know.
I must've been robbed.
- Why didn't you mention this earlier?
- I hadn't noticed.
A beautiful and expensive object from Turkish royalty goes missing and you fail to notice?
We believe it was in possession of our fugitive,
- the one you denied knowing.
- Did you give this to him?
Did you promise a share of your winnings if he killed Tode for you?
- No!
- But you know who this man is.
Can you give us his name?
Or would you prefer to be arrested as an accessory to murder?
I only knew him as 'Denizci' - 'sailor' in Turkish'.
We met during the war.
Both our ships were sunk by mines.
- He saved my life.
- What happened to your sailor?
Shell shocked.
The war had broken him.
- But he returned to England?
- Yes.
I begged him to staybut he refused.
When was the last time you saw him?
He came to visit me the night of the prize-giving.
I could not offer him shelter but I gave him what I had.
I told him to sell that for money.
- Where was he headed?
- He didn't say.
But he had nothing to do with Quentin Tode's death.
Do you recognise this?
We found it in Quentin Tode's pocket.
No.
I am sorry.
What date was your ship sunk, Mr Efendi?
18 March, 1915.
This killings you say Denizci's guilty of, were they in self-defence?
No.
No, they were all unarmed.
He murdered them in cold blood.
You're free to go now, Mr Efendi.
Lord Fisher?
Baron?
Have you seen Baron Fisher, Mr Butler?
- Not upstairs resting?
- No.
I've looked everywhere.
Dottie!
Mr B!
Out here!
Bert!
Wake up!
Where's the cab?
Somebody hit me with a bloody truck.
Try naval records for officers that went down that day in the Dardanelles.
Least we might narrow it down to this 'Denizci'.
- Do we know what Tode was poisoned with yet?
- This just came in, sir.
All medicines in Mr Tode's possession were harmless.
- No sign of poison.
- Thank you.
I'm off now, sir.
- Oh.
I'll get that.
You go ahead.
Thank you, sir.
City South.
Yes.
Yes, Miss Fisher is right here.
Miss Williams for you.
Dot?
How?
I'll be right home.
My father has managed to escape his house arrest.
His letter was with the rest of the mail this afternoon.
It could've been stolen and altered at any stage.
Who knows how long this man's been lurking.
Poor Baron.
He thought he was putting us all in danger.
This was not a noble gesture, Dot.
It's not in my father's repertoire.
No.
He's up to something.
- With our cab.
- Here, get that into ya.
Nothing else upstairs, Miss, and I've gone through all the rubbish.
Thank you, Mr B.
There's a letter in here, Miss.
Oh, no, that's... .. my mother's handwriting.
'Dear Henry, I can't believe you've gone back to your old ways after all this time, gambling and lying and risking everything we have.
I know that man had something to do with it but you should never have deserted me and my patience has run out.
I have loved you with all my heart, Henry, despite everything, but if you fail to arrive on that ship when it docks at Southampton,
I will be asking for a formal separation.
Your wife, Margaret.
Father O'Leary?
You should know better than to interrupt a discourse with God.
But, if you've come to ask for clemency for your utter stupidity...
- You're glowing, Father.
- Holy light.
The hand of God.
Do you see what miracle is upon me?
Unless there's another explanation.
- What is it, Collins?
- Father O'Leary's collar.
I remember the gatekeeper talking about Mr Tode's eyes and how they glowed in the dark.
I thought he was crazy but then I remembered the eye drops.
But the eye drops in his suitcase were unopened.
He must've had more.
And they came into contact with Father O'Leary's cassock when he attacked Tode in the grounds.
And they could've dropped the bottle in the struggle.
- I'm gonna search the far side.
- Good work, Collins.
- We'll have a look round here.
- Sir.
Turn off your torch, Jack.
If it's still glowing, we'll see it.
Oh, Jack, what if it's my fault?
What if I drove my father away?
I railed against him.
What if...
What if something happens and I never see him again?
Whatever happens to your father, it's not your fault and nothing is going to happen.
Perhaps he has just headed back to England after all.
Well, if it's all expanding, England will move further away.
But it all looks very still to me.
That's because you're not a telescope.
- Is that supposed to be a compliment?
- More like a romantic overture.
- Is that the best that you can do?
- Would you like me to improve on it?
More than anything.
Jack.
Behind you.
What the hell is in that?
His eye drops are not just phosphorescent.
Watch this.
- They're radioactive?
- Highly.
At some point, a lethal dose of polonium has been added to them.
- Polonium?
- Is that like radium?
Related.
Polonium is extremely unstable and highly toxic if ingested.
Our killer could have more of it.
What form would it be in, Mac?
It'd have to be a powder or a liquid form to mix with eye drops.
How dangerous is it, aside from swallowing it?
Both forms are a deadly hazard.
I'll be encasing this lot in lead.
If it's sealed correctly, the radiation itself isn't lethal but, if ingested or inhaled, just a speck of polonium can be deadly.
If the man who is after my father has done this,
I hope to God Father's not brave enough to go after him.
There was a delivery of polonium two weeks ago.
There should be a corresponding order.
Let's see.
Ah.
Here.
It was six weeks ago.
But no name on the order.
Is this your signature?
No, that's Osman Efendi's.
He often signs for deliveries when I'm not here.
Polonium must've stood out as unusual.
I assume it was part of Quentin Tode's research.
Well, who has access to these chemicals?
All of our scientific staff have keys.
It's gone.
Mr Tode's other supplies are still there but there's no sign of the polonium.
I don't understand.
I kept your secret and I gave you money.
- It's what you wanted.
- You broke our promise!
- But we agreed.
- Oh, yes, milord.
Take everything and leave me nothing and then waste it all.
- Denizci?
Denizci, it's only me.
Were you followed?
No.
I was careful.
I've come to warn you.
I don't know how much longer I can keep the police at bay.
You need to give yourself up.
Please?
Don't worry about me.
This will all be over soon.
I promise you.
Good luck, Denizci.
Morning, Miss.
You're up early.
I couldn't sleep, Dot.
Today's the day my father's meant to be boarding that ship.
I said a prayer for him last night, asked God to keep him safe.
I suppose that might assist.
In any case, God's far more likely to listen to you than me.
You said there was a job I could do.
I need you to find out what you can about Tode's scientific work.
Look for any mention of polonium.
This is the chemical symbol, the atomic number - 84 - and all the known compounds.
As soon as the Institute opens.
I'm sorry, Dot.
I'm distracting you from your wedding preparations.
Oh, no, Miss.
We're prepared.
But I am beginning to think it might be easier to get married in a registry office, rather than deal with Father O'Leary.
He's not very forgiving, for a Christian.
I think the Irish cancels that out.
Miss Fisher?
We found the cab.
It was dumped at Vic Markets.
What else?
- This was left behind.
Yes?
I've wrestled with my conscience all night, Miss Fisher.
I owe my life to that man but he has gone mad.
- What is it, Mr Efendi?
- He has a hostage.
It could be the man you're looking for.
It has something to do with an old grudge.You need to stop him.
Do you have an address?
It's hidden at the rear of an old hat factory.
It's called...
Ahhh!
Mr Efendi?
!
I've roamed this Earth like a beggar while you reigned over my life, my home, my history and you dare to sell it for a song!
- The estate?
- Time to pay the price.
Are you gonna kill me?
No.
Your daughter is clever.
She'll come for you soon enough.
But when she does, I'm gonna kill her in front of you.
She won't come.
You don't understand.
I was a drunkard.
I was cruel.
She doesn't care about me.
You're wasting your time.
I know where to get you money, more than your fortune was worth.
The estate can be yours again.
?
50,000 in cash.
Where?
Osman knew where he was.
He said something about an old hat factory.
Maybe he wrote it down.
Miss?
I found out more about Mr Tode and polonium.
15 years ago, Mr Tode invented a paint called 'Illumina'.
for Myer Towers, the company that make clocks and watches, same manufacturer as that wristlet watch.
That engraving. 'Remember'.
It must have something to do with that.
Jack!
- Le Bon Vie.
- The good life?
It was a milliners in Fitzroy.
Closed down about a year ago.
Dot, find out what else you can about that paint.
Why don't you try the science journals in the Logan Wren's office?
Jack, this way!
They were here.
Inspector, this just came through from Naval Records.
'March 18, 1915.
Battleship Ocean, Morto Bay, Turkish gunfire...'
'Captain William Eugene Fisher.' It all makes sense.
Eugene Fisher was my father's cousin.
the previous Baron of Richmond-upon-Thames.
He died in the early stages of the war.
He was reported missing, presumed drowned.
What's this?
The prize money.
What if my father's gone after it?
How?
It's in the safe at the Institute.
- Who do you think taught me every shady trick I know?
- Of course.
He's trying to pay his way out of trouble.
Oh, no.
Dot!
Today, we had hoped to celebrate the scientific achievements of Mr Osman Efendi.
He was a man of integrity and brilliance.
Sadly... he cannot be with us.
Gertrude Harris.
Gwynnie Hayes.
- Agnes Wren...
- Hurry up!
Alright!
Better get this right.
Your daughter's life depends on it.
Collins, make sure those men cover every exit and do a sweep of the ground.
- Any sign of Dot?
- No, Miss.
Make sure nobody leaves.
We'll check this gate.
- What's taking so long?
- I'm nearly there.
Just let me think!
Perhaps this will help.
No!
Don't!
- Dot!
- Get back!
All of you!
If you want your father to walk out of here alive,
Miss Fisher, open this safe.
Put down the gun.
The money's all there.
Put it in this bag.
Hurry.
- That's everything.
- Now get back.
Pick up the bag.
You can't kill us all, Eugene.
You were once an honourable man, Eugene.
What happened?
- The war!
That bloody disaster!
- You had a choice.
But you ran away like a coward.
- No!
Don't move!
Dottie, are you alright?
Eugene Fisher, we're arresting you for multiple charges of murder and abduction.
Are you alright, Father?
I'll be outside.
- And you, Dot?
- I'm alright, Miss.
Did you find out anything more about that polonium paint?
I found the polonium.
Your wife's watch.
She worked at the Myer Towers watch factory.
The women would lick their brushes to a sharp point.
And that's how they became so ill.
- Four of them died.
- Including your wife.
My beautiful Agnes died far too early because of Quentin Tode's scientific lies so I made sure that he paid a price with his life.
And, I'm afraid to say...
.. I have no regrets.
Why did you hide Eugene from us?
We all thought he'd died during the war.
When he turned up the first time, I couldn't believe it but if I told anyone he would've been court martialled for desertion.
I couldn't have that, not when all he wanted was money.
What about Mother?
Why didn't you tell her?
Because I thought Eugene was satisfied and after losing Janey and all the damage I'd done, I...
It would've been too much for her.
We'd only just left it behind us.
We had money, a beautiful home, a happy future.
I owed her that.
I owed it to you all.
And then Eugene returned.
A few months agoout of the blue.
He told me he'd already killed a man to hide our secret.
'Our secret,' he said, as if I was responsible.
He demanded everything and all I could think of to do was to take the money and run.
I told your mother I'd lost everything in a game of cards.
But I promised to get it back.
Well, you have.
It's all too late.
When she meets my ship, I won't be there and our marriage will be over.
- Is that what you want?
- Oh, God!
No, Phryne.
Your mother... is the love of my life.
I never wanted anyone else.
Well, then, you'd better pack your bags tonight.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
But, Phryne, my ship has sailed.
There are other ways to travel.
Oh, no.
I hate flying!
Good, then you can suffer for love.
Hugh, I could've been shot today.
Don't, Dottie.
Please, don't.
- I can't bear the thought.
- Me either.
So let's not waste time.
Let's get married like we said.
I thought you were joking.
What's the hurry?
Miss Fisher's leaving for England in the morning.
I really don't want her to miss it, Hugh.
Please?
Dottie, are you sure?
It's not gonna be the wedding you wanted.
I love you, Hugh,and I want you.
- Five o'clock tonight?
- You leave it to me, Dottie.
'And God stretcheth out the Heavens as a curtain and spreadeth the mount as a tent to dwell in.
- Isaiah, chapter 40, verse 22.' - 22.
So, in your opinion,
God's behind it all, this expanding universe business?
And phosphorescence and polonium and all the other miracles and probably even aliens, if they exist.
So God invented the miracle of science.
Pretty much.
I don't think I've ever seen you look so pretty, Dot.
That cop's a lucky bloke, alright.
Hang on.
Careful, you two!
So, Dot, are you ready for your biggest adventure?
I won't even close my eyes, Miss.
I, Dorothy Anne Williams, take you, Hugh Theobald Collins, for my lawful husband, to have and to hold from this day forward until death do us part.
- Whoo!
- Dottie!
- Yay!
- Yay!
- Congratulations.
Well done, love.
When I came to work for you, Miss, I was afraid of everything and you taught me so many things and made me brave and you made me happy.
Please come back safely.
Oh, Dot.
Good luck.
- Bye!
- Bye!
Oh, Jack, look!
- Ready, Father?
- No.
We're going to die!
There's no point getting upset in the air.
Very unforgiving element.
Contact.
Get in.
Jack.
What are you doing?
Phryne?
Flying all the way to England in that?
It's the only way I can make sure he'll get there.
For God's sake!
What if this thing takes off?
- Come after me.
- What did you say?
It was a romantic overture.
Say it again.
Come after me, Jack Robinson.
When you two have quite finished...
I always feared another man would sweep you away from me.
I never thought it'd be your father.
There's a whole world out there, Jack.
He's the least of your worries!
All right, now explode, full power.
100%.
That is 100%.
PSI of those jabs is averaging 129.
On the power scale, that's...
Kitten.
Sad kitten.
Left up and sting it.
(grunting)
(motorcycle roaring)
SYLVESTER:
Speaking of sting,
Chet again.
And an a.m. drop-off.
See you again tonight?
Sure thing.
Thanks for the lift.
Yeah.
(motorcycle roaring)
What's wrong with your bike?
New clutch is on back order.
TOBY:
I know we've both moved on, but she's parading her new fling right in my face?
She's just so cold and mechanical.
You want to distract yourself from her, then grow a set and focus.
(shouting, grunting)
There you go.
Now you're getting it, kid!
(grunting)
WOMAN:
Hello?
Excuse me.
Can we help you?
Deputy Homeland Director Katherine Cooper.
Where is...
Molina?
I'm Scorpion's Homeland liaison now.
Deputy director.
Downgrade.
She cutting our funding, too?
Your funding is intact.
She just doesn't want to... interact with you, because of the prior... interaction.
SYLVESTER:
She wanted to leave me to die in a jail.
She's easily alienated.
TOBY:
You seem edgy.
Why are you so edgy?
I'm not edgy.
I'm just...
I'm pressed for time, and I have a classified mission to assign.
And it smells so bad in here.
Is that... intentional?
That is Toby.
Because this is a black operation, my information is need-to-know.
Walter O'Brien, Cabe Gallo, Happy Quinn, join me in my SUV.
TOBY:
Hmm.
You heading north or south?
Ooh, eye flutter on "south."
Huntington,
Long Beach, San Pedro...
San Pedro it is, meaning water.
SYLVESTER:
The ports.
A frigate?
Can we leave now?
And you can only take three of the team, so space is an issue.
A submarine.
It's a submarine, isn't it?
Anyway, Homeland needs
Scorpion's help for a black-ops nuclear submarine mission deep in international waters off the coast of California?
Ooh.
WALTER:
They'll be needing me to code?
I'll get my laptop.
HAPPY:
And I will be building something, so I'll get my tools.
SYLVESTER:
And I will get my party hat because I don't have to go on a submarine.
CABE:
And I'll be going to keep anyone from wanting to kill them.
Welcome to Scorpion.
I'm still reading an edge.
What's up with that?
You just disclosed details on a classified mission.
I just need to know that you'll keep this confidential.
What's confidential?
Who's this?
Uh, he's, um, my... my friend.
RAY:
Hey, buddy.
SYLVESTER:
He's using my mug.
He's staying here?
You need to get...
Mr. Saigon out of here.
Things are dicey between Scorpion and Director Molina, and you can't afford any more... issues.
Walter, we never discussed Ray staying in the Airstream, and he doesn't present a professional image, so...
You got to go.
For the good of the team.
RAY:
Okay.
Just need to get the Grem out of lockdown and then...
on my way.
I'll take you to the lot.
Sweet.
Thank you.
Actually, if you could drive my car back, I would... appreciate it.
They won't release a car in the impound lot to someone with a suspended license, which...
I don't even understand that.
Oh, this just keeps getting better.
That's your new friend, and you're just gonna kick him to the curb?
Just like that?
Yes.
I am surrounded by robots.
Now that we have some privacy...
We don't.
I'm on comms with the team.
We'll stay that way on the sub, piggybacking on the antennae.
COOPER:
Fine.
But... under no circumstances will you disclose the location of the sub once you're on board.
The Navy insists that remains classified.
50 bucks I can figure out their exact location anyway.
You want to bet?
It's a bet.
We got a bet?
You have a serious problem.
No duh.
COOPER:
We're going to San Pedro to ferry you out to a special ops nuclear sub.
The mission is to analyze a Vulture, an ocean floor data hunter, attached to an underwater fiber optic cable on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
Attached by whom?
Not yet determined.
But the device is tapping a highly secure line between the United States Department of Defense and the Chinese government in Shanghai.
Happy, we need you to build an extension to the submarine's arm.
We'll use it to tap a cable from Walter's computer into the listening device.
Walter, you'll hack into the device's mainframe and identify whoever is intercepting our communications.
MAN:
Welcome aboard the XB-4.
I'm Captain Steven Jones.
This is Ensign Nathan Hall, our Bullgeorge.
He'll be looking after you riders during this mission.
We have eight other crew members in the Forward Operational Compartment.
Ballast tank, trim tank, reactor control, turbine control.
It's gearhead heaven.
JONES:
And all highly classified.
What you see here stays here.
This mission is top secret.
No one outside of Langley knows our objective or location.
Captain, we're rigged for dive.
Very well.
Take the Conn, submerge the ship.
I have the Conn!
Ahead two-thirds.
Dive, dive, dive.
Five-degree down bubble.
Make your depth 200 feet.
Come left to course 270.
This, uh, crew is different from most of the military we have worked with.
We get 18 months of training before ever seeing the inside of a sub.
A lot of us here are nuclear engineers.
It makes the hierarchy a little different from the rest of the military.
We do have a saying,
"When hundreds of feet below, the power goes to he who knows""
Or she.
Or she.
Zing.
Happy.
Great use of her humor programming.
I need to check on the crew.
Give me just a second.
TOBY:
Walter, what's your speed?
Uh, I estimate about 20 knots.
My lunch.
It's conveniently shaped.
And our best way of figuring out their location.
They left San Pedro at 8:25.
(whooshing sound)
Roughly 20 knots for 30 minutes.
Sub would head for closest, deepest water.
That would be right off the Palos Verdes shelf break.
Putting you 15 miles east of Catalina Island.
WALTER:
Miss.
Ah.
See, I don't like the mojo of playing Battleship with an actual battleship.
It's not Battleship.
It's Battle Sub.
32 degrees north...
(whistles) 117 degrees west.
(whooshing sound)
Point Loma?
Call that a hit.
Walter,
I'm gonna sink your battle sub.
Please, don't harm the pickles.
NATHAN:
Hey, we're dark.
No outgoing communication.
Half my team's on the mainland.
They will be the only half not incarcerated if information is leaked.
Your orders to disallow communications are illogical.
Toby and Sylvester are part of this team.
I have my orders.
You have my instructions.
And you will follow them.
(crunch)
I think Captain just Crunched their comms.
I'm picking up bits and pieces, but I can barely make anything out.
Follow me.
I thought they were supposed to be working with us.
Military protocol doesn't have a lot of flexibility.
Let's say we toe the line.
("Flea Market Montgomery" song playing) I still can't make anything out.
This cancels our bet.
No bet.
Bet off.
Whatever.
I'm just trying to enjoy my off time.

SYLVESTER AND MAN:
♪ It's just like, it's just like ♪
♪ A mini mall, hey, hey... ♪
PAIGE:
You got to be kidding me.
Ma'am, it's not my problem that your husband doesn't pay his parking tickets.
He is not my husband.
And $1,200 is $1,100 over the value of the car.
I'd counter that you can't put a price on the value of a home.
Just a few forms to fill out.
Pen.
I'll handle it.
Cool.
NATHAN:
Let's see if you're worth your salt.
The rods and clamps I affixed to the main jib will act like the arms of an arthroscopic surgery device.
Extending now.
We'll use the camera to find the communication port on the listening device.
There.
Not bad.
WALTER:
Access port exposed.
Happy, connect the cable.
And we're in.
Uploading their interface.
Toby calls us robots, but, tell me, what's more fascinating than a robot?
Oh, he endlessly analyzes feelings,
Sylvester is a mess of feelings, Paige helps us sort them.
But without the metal gears of the machine, it doesn't run.
CABE:
I guess my role is to kick the machine when it starts talking and doesn't focus.
NATHAN:
We've analyzed the exterior construction of the device-- Swiss metalwork, Dutch wiring-- but no clue as to who put it there.
I'm in the main interface.
I thought this would take an hour at least.
Why are you stopping?
That seemed a little too easy.
Happy, detach the cabling for the device.
Aye, aye.
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of a mission, damn near the end.
My instinct says that this is a dummy interface, a lure to draw us into the system to plant some malware onto your sub or something worse.
Worse like what?
Aborting the mission requires a direct order from the captain.
Then get it, fast, 'cause I have a feeling we want to be as far away from that device as possible.
Walter, tell me what's happening.
Sir.
(boom)
Whoa.
(alarm beeping)

♪ Let's make it a dance, come on now... ♪

JONES:
Flooding... engine room!
Something's wrong.
Come on, Happy.
Not funny.
I told you we shouldn't have played Battle Sub.
NATHAN:
Reactor's scrammed.
We've lost propulsion.
Lost depth control.
Prepare for impact!
We're gonna hit the ocean floor!

Is everyone okay?
WALTER:
Fine.
HAPPY:
Good.
How did this happen?
There was an explosive device on the Vulture to keep it from being hacked or captured.
We need to do a vessel diagnostic.
HAPPY:
I'll help.
Electric has failed.
Engines have failed.
We're settled at a 40-degree angle.
Well, the size of the blast was likely enough to flood the compartments between here and the rest of the crew.
Communications are out.
And my team doesn't know where we are because you killed our comms.
It gets worse.
The Navy won't know that we're missing until we don't arrive at our rendezvous point in six hours, and for security purposes only the people on the submarine know the course that was charted.
(tapping in Morse code)
Thank God they're alive.
(tapping in Morse code continues)
"Electric down.
"Trying to get the hatch open.
We're compromised."
(tapping in Morse code continues)
"No generator."
No oxygen system.
The shared ventilation system provides all of us with roughly 150 cubic feet of oxygen.
Divide that by 13, each consuming 1.5 cubic feet of oxygen per hour, we have one hour and ten minutes of oxygen left.
CABE:
I'm a Marine-- I spent a lot of time on a ship.
You have immersion suits down here for underwater escape.
Uh, we do, but not in this compartment.
Then we need to get a message out.
Where's the communications panel?
Maybe I can fix it.
No, we're supposed to be running silent.
I believe our directive has changed.
The communications?
In the bow, past that bulkhead.
CABE:
Let me go check.
We're gonna need all hands.
All hands.
Happy, come in.
XB-4, come in.
TOBY:
Yes, I'm here.
I don't care what meeting she's in.
Tell Director Cooper there's an emergency.
Giving me the runaround.
Then run around her.
We're gonna go see this Cooper.
Your car is in the shop.
That was painful.
This whole experience has been painful.
Odd.
Most people who come in here are real upbeat.
(phone ringing) There you go.
Your keys.
You've got good news for me, right?
I've won the lottery?
Wrong.
Where are the keys to your car?
I need them now.
They're in my purse.
Then you need to go to Cooper's office right now.
I'm gonna explain later, but Cabe, Walter and Happy are in serious trouble.
Okay.
Where the hell is he?
Ray!
I got to go!
Oh, God.
Hey, they got doughnuts in the break room.
Paige?
Okay.
(metallic creaking)
(panting):
The water is freezing.
Yeah, well, at this depth the temperature can't be more than 28 degrees.
You have an interesting breadth of knowledge.
The entire system was shorted in the explosion.
I've circumvented a number of blown circuits to see if there's any way to bring this back to life.
Okay, Cabe, on my call, hit the breaker on the wall.
Go.
(electric humming)
We good?
(electric crackling)
HAPPY:
We are not good!
Keep it out of the water, or we're all dead!
(electric crackling)
(grunts)
(gasping breaths)
That was close.
It's fried.
We have zero communication with the surface.
TOBY:
The only way we're gonna find them is if we pinpoint their location.
Before they went dark, we had Point Loma.
Walter said they were at 20 knots.
I'm saying good guess.
This is an arc representing 35 minutes, 22 knots from Point Loma.
We don't know exactly where the secret underwater cable is that connects the U.S. and China, but if it follows a similar route to the Trans-Pacific Express cable...
And there's... a very rough guess as to the whereabouts of our sub.
With a bite taken out of it.
(tires screech)
Oh...
God.
(phone rings)
Yeah, I'm here.
What do you have?
The rough coordinates for Cooper-- I'm texting them now.
(tapping in Morse code)
They're saying the sub has listed too far.
The silt is blocking their port hatch.
They can't get out.
Ask them from now on to keep it to good news only.
I will not suggest that to the captain.
So they have the escape suits in their compartment and no way out, and we have a way out but no escape suits.
Even if we did have the immersion suits, it's doubtful we could survive in water this cold.
You'd have ten minutes before severe hypothermia set in, and that's if you made it to the surface.
Which is highly unlikely, given that we're 300 feet down.
What's the depth rating of those survival suits?
225 feet.
Here.
NATHAN:
There seems to be some kind of plan forming here, and as commanding officer,
I'm the one who should be making these decisions.
Well, I thought the power goes to he who knows.
And we know how to build one of those suits from scratch.
You just listed all the ways that it's certain death.
Sitting here is certain death-- what we're talking about is just likely death.
I should volunteer then.
I'll go.
I'm the biggest and most immune to hypothermia.
You know if you leave, there's a good chance that you die before any of us.
I'm the most expendable.
I can't risk Happy and you.
And you know the sub.
Greater good.
Greater good.
COOPER:
The Navy isn't going to send a rescue unless the sub misses its rendezvous or there's proof of failure.
The Navy has absolutely no evidence there's anything gone wrong with this mission.
We were in communication with the sub when it went down.
Well, I told them that.
They're of the opinion your team was listening in on an illegal signal that just happened to break down.
Nothing to warrant a rescue mission.
My people are smarter than your people.
I have coordinates for where the sub might be.
You don't want to wake up tomorrow knowing you could have helped save 13 people who died because you followed the rules.
I feel like the Michelin Man.
WALTER:
Okay, Cabe, once you reach the surface...
You have one cartridge.
Parachute flare-- visible for 30 miles.
When you get help, get the Navy to send a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle out of San Diego.
Regardless of where we're at, it'll take at least 150 minutes to get here.
We'll be out of oxygen.
HAPPY:
After you get rescued-- and you will get rescued-- you get this list to Toby.
It's everything they'll need to make an oxygen tank they can load down to us.
It'll give us enough air to stay alive until the rescue.
All contingent, of course, on you surviving the ascent.
I hadn't thought about that for a second.
Thanks for the reminder.
Okay, exhale slowly and continuously on your way up.
You won't have to worry about the bends, because the sub has the same air pressure as the surface.
Should be a quick trip up.
You'll have ten minutes from when you enter the water until hypothermia and, uh... death.
Buck up, kiddo.
Didn't you join the Navy for adventure?
He should be breaking the surface now.
If he's not, he's drowning.
(gasping)
God... please let this work.
If we don't hear from Cabe soon, one of us will go up next.
No pressure suits?
I don't like the odds of making it to the surface.
Versus the odds of death in here?
We have 40 minutes of air left.
OFFICER:
I'm two nautical miles into the search zone.
Haven't seen anything.
They've been searching 15 minutes and only covered three percent of the target zone.
Your coordinates cover 50 square miles of open ocean.
It's gonna take a while.
Toby, you got to narrow it down.
TOBY:
We're working with a half-eaten hoagie and a piece of chalk.
It's not like we're mind readers.
What it is like... is a mini mall.
You have finally gone insane.
No, the video I was watching.
♪ Aw, yeah, come shop ♪
♪ With us ♪
While you were guessing locations,
I was watching that video.
When you made your second guess to Walter, he was singing, ♪ It's just like ♪
♪ It's just like a mini mall. ♪
And when you made your third and correct guess, he was saying living rooms, dinettes.
The time between those two lyrics is 14 seconds.
We now know the distance they traveled between two spots and how long it took 'em to cover that ground.
Which gives us their accurate speed, not a guess.
15.38 knots, not 20.
Walter overestimated.
Their location is 117.03 west and 32.05 north.
I'm way out of range of those new coordinates, but there is a commercial vessel in that area.
I'll reach out to them.
Where are you going?
I'm getting us a chopper and getting us on that rescue boat.
(beeps)
(deep horn blares)
Help!
(clanging)
Did you hear that?
Cabe.
Oh, that tough son of a bitch made it.
Thank God.
Sir, phone.
SYLVESTER:
Cabe, we can't believe you're alive.
CABE:
We can celebrate later.
If we want to save the others, we got to work fast.
I need an air tank the size of a hot water heater, a winch from a tow truck, three brass circa 1935-40 electric fans, a waterproof box, a GoPro camera, a 14-inch diameter pipe and a battery pack.
Real quick-- how did Happy suggest we get this stuff?
Mr. Quinn.
Fellas.
Been a while.
No time to chat.
Happy's in trouble, we need your help and a load of equipment.
Starting with the winch on your tow truck.
We got to move fast.
Paige'll be here with the chopper in ten minutes.
Chopper?
(tapping)
They don't know how much longer they can last.
I didn't know you knew Morse code.
I didn't before I got on the sub, but I figured it out.
Our time frame for the oxygen supply didn't account for the deeper breathing caused by fear.
I'm ashamed to say that my breathing might be similarly impacted right now.
But somehow...
yours doesn't seem to be.
We're not military.
We take our orders from math and science.
Right now we know the odds of survival are slim, but we know that mathematically there's a chance.
Some people call us robotic, mechanical.
(tapping resumes) But in situations like this, our constitution is a benefit.
"Still safer than an airplane"?
Why is he communicating that?
We know subs are safer because there are more airplanes in the water than submarines in the sky.
Why would a submarine be in the sky?
It makes no sense.
Somehow they're managing to joke.
Humor-- at a time like this-- that isn't something a captain would normally order.
Not standard operating procedure.
So strict adherence to protocol isn't always the best... tack.
What are you getting at?
An unconventional solution.
Okay.
Uh...
Now, mathematically, their lives-- yours and Happy's as well-- are collectively more valuable than mine.
Are the oxygen levels getting to you now, O'Brien?
If we flood the chamber with an exact amount of water, we can cause the sub to correct position, freeing the trapped sailors' hatch.
Just 18 degrees would be enough to get the hatch out of the silt.
The others have immersion suits-- they could leave via the hatch, reaching the surface.
This chamber-- the one that we're in-- is a closed space.
If we flood it even partially, the rising water will compress the air above it.
We breathe in that compressed air, we can no longer swim to the surface like Cabe did.
We'll die from the bends.
We're trapped.
That is right.
We'll need to leave in a pressurized chamber.
That means waiting for a sub rescue that we don't have enough oxygen to wait for.
That's why we should make you both improvised suits like we did for Cabe.
You both leave and I will flood the chamber.
Nine people escape the boat, oxygen usage drops, leaving me a few more minutes of air.
Anyone could make the same calculations.
I don't think anyone else makes that calculation, and you still won't have enough air to keep you alive until rescue comes.
In order to flood this compartment with the exact amount of water, you need to close the hatch, too.
That is a two-person job.
I'm staying.
No.
I can figure out a way to get it...
I'm staying.
And you'll need a Navy person to work the locking device.
It's really a three-person job.
Three of us working together maximizes the odds of success.
(helicopter blades whirring)
How did my quiet day turn into this?
Come on.
Time's a-wasting.
When the water gets to this level, we close the hatch, okay?
Ready?
Okay.
One, two... (grunts)
Damn it!
Not good.
That's just what Happy says.
(all grunting)
Come on.
Lean into it!
(grunting)
Not smooth, but effective.
I hope so.
I had to guess the silt density.
(laughs) We're shifting.
Whoa!
(laughs) (tapping)
It worked!
Their hatch is clear.
"Thank you.
And Godspeed."
I have to agree that personality-wise you don't seem too similar.
She can be very, uh, rigid.
She was chatty when she was really young.
She was talking in full sentences at seven months old.
I got her a dollhouse when she wasn't even three yet.
She put in her own wiring with working lights.
I was terrified it was gonna be a fire hazard.
I... pulled them all out.
Next day, she rewired it.
Had to take it away.
That's about when she started getting quiet.
I should've just let her do what she was gonna do.
(grunts)
You like my daughter, don't you?
I love your daughter.
All right.
Then just let her do what she's gonna do.
One more should do it.
Thank you.
You okay?
(sighs) Honestly?
No.
This is my first day on the field.
I'm in the middle of the ocean, on a trawler, trying to save lives.
It just might be too big a first bite for a desk jockey.
Before Scorpion, I was a waitress.
Feeling overwhelmed is part of the job, but it's a job I learned I can handle.
You'll learn, too.
Guys?
JONES:
Yes!
Yes!
(whoops)
Either the ocean is lousy with mermen or those are our submariners!
Get these men out of the water!
(tapping)
The crew made it.
WALTER:
Hopefully your tank's on its way, Happy.
So now our lives are in Toby's hands.
(panting)
Fantastic.
SYLVESTER:
They're still stuck down there without enough oxygen.
Three people use six liters per minute, seven if they're stressed, which, of course, they are.
There are 122 liters of oxygen left, which is 17 minutes, give or take a few seconds.
Rescue sub's 35 minutes out.
The tank that we made gives them 45 minutes of oxygen.
If this works, it saves their lives.
We're hooked up!
Let's go!
(whirring)
Dear God, let this work.
There it is!
My daughter's in there.
In case we don't make it out of here,
I just want to say
I'm not really a robot.
Thank you for clarifying.
I did know you weren't made of circuitry.
We both play a good game of denial.
It might be the one thing where I can beat you, but right now my dad is up there trying to save me.
A man I've been looking for for 25 years.
I just never expected to want to live as badly as I do right now.
I saved nine sailors' lives instead of us.
I... supported that act with calculations.
But perhaps there was... some sentimentality attached.
And, uh, you let that certifiable lunatic stay in our garage.
(chuckles)
Uh...
Maybe we're changing.
Maybe... maybe I'm not a robot either.
You're not normal people, are you?
(creaking)
Greetings submerged.
Toby Curtis here, talking to you underwater.
If you can hear me, open the sub's garbage chute.
We're connecting an oxygen tank now.
So, if you feel a little bump, that's just us.
If you can't hear me, it means you're already dead.
SYLVESTER:
Don't say that.
Oh, God.
TOBY:
If they're goners, whatever I say won't mean a poot.
SYLVESTER:
You're still recording.
Okay, you heard him.
Yeah, let's get to it.
Okay, I don't see the disposal unit opening.
Come on!
There!
Forward!
Now!
(door clacks open)
They did it!
I have never been so happy to smell garbage.
Ah, some nice solders there.
Wiring's not great.
A good sized tank.
Overall, I'd rate the craftsmanship as pretty good.
Okay, so, how big's the tank?
About eight feet by three feet.
Can we use this tank as a getaway vehicle?
There's not enough propulsion with the three of us in it.
The tank would never even make it to the surface.
It would just sit there, suspended about 100 feet off the bottom.
Yeah, but the tank gives us 298 cubic liters of 20% oxygen.
Should be enough for about 45 more minutes.
(sniffing) Something wrong?
The-the-the...
the air.
Smells like the fridge in our garage.
It's sulfur.
I thought it was coming from the trash, but it's not.
It's coming from underneath this compartment.
It's lead/acid batteries.
The seawater must have leaked in, caused a chemical reaction that produced sulfur.
Ah, the sulfur's not the problem.
The same reaction could also produce chloride.
That's the problem.
What are you doing?
Walter's right.
It's chloride.
Okay.
I've been around enough batteries to know breathing in that stuff will dissolve your lungs.
Okay, so, we don't have 45 minutes anymore.
It's more like five.
Okay, sailor, we're down, but we're not out!
Ensign?
What are you going?
There's a very specific protocol on this sub.
Self-destruct?
If our enemies capture this sub, its technology could be used to kill thousands of Americans or our allies.
In the event that the craft is disabled, the last officer on board has to initiate the sequence.
HAPPY:
But the Navy's on their way.
They'll recover the ship.
Yeah, but what if they can't?
What if they run into logistical problems, which is very possible?
What if whoever planted the device that we came here for tries to get it as soon as we leave?
That's why the protocol's in place, and that's why we have to follow it.
What's the maximum countdown for the self-destruct protocol?
Maximum five minutes.
Initiate countdown.
In five minutes, either the air fills with poison, or we explode.
(alarm blaring)
Guess we got to get out of here in four and a half.
(alarm sounding) HAPPY:
Walt, we've got less than a minute now.
This is when you normally think of something brilliant, so how's that coming?
!
An escape pod.
The oxygen tank could be used as an escape pod.
I asked for brilliant.
I already told you there's too many bodies for buoyancy.
We're just sit gonna there in the water.
Yeah, normally we would, but in our present circumstances, we're likely to be propelled upward from the blast.
You really think we can ride the explosion of this submarine?
Yes.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Or we die.
Okay, look, get up the trash chute and into the tank.
Come on, Happy, let's go.
(grunting)
Go.
Go.
(grunting)
It's not gonna be comfortable.
Okay, you go.
I need to make sure the ship goes down.
So you're gonna rigidly adhere to the rules even if it costs you your life?
!
It's my duty.
Your duty is to save as many lives as possible.
That includes your own.
Okay?
Okay?
!
Okay, okay.
You first.
All right.
Okay.
(grunts)
(panting)
Come on!
Come on!
I don't fit!
Come on.
Okay, just relax.
Relax?
Why?
It's an out-of-the-box solution, and it may sting a little.
(crack) Aah!
Yeah.
Aah!
You can fit through the hole now.
Oh!
All right, Happy, get us out of here.
Just reversing the spin on these fans!
Any way we can go any faster?
No.
Now shut up and brace yourself.
(coughing)
Just talked to the rescue sub.
Ten minutes out.
(seagulls cawing)
(explosion)
(water gurgling)
Oh, no.
Happy.
Cabe, tell me this didn't just happen.
HAPPY:
Hey, dummies!
A little help?
!
They're alive.
Thank God.
Couldn't have done it without you, desk jockey.
Good work, fellas.
I just wanted to say, uh, thank you.
You know, you're a... you're a hero.
Well, I'm not a hero.
It's just math.
I don't know.
One thing I've learned about you is you don't always live by the numbers.
Sometimes you trust yourself, believe in your team despite the numbers.
There's another variable in there that you're not copping to.
Hey.
Let's go downstairs.
I want to show you something.
TOBY:
There he is.
Big Ray!
Where you been?
I just hitchhiked from Gardena.
TOBY:
Whoa.
RAY:
Yeah, I guess
I'm not normally a person people stop for, so...
Ray?
Hi.
Hey.
I'm...
Excuse me, fellas.
Ray, I'm sorry I ditched you this morning.
We...
It was an emergency.
Not a problem.
In fact, I saved you a doughnut.
Here.
Oh.
Still hungry.
I just...
Thanks.
Um, how about I, um...
I get you a burger?
Please sit.
Yeah?
A burger?
Want to sit down?
Yeah, sounds great.
Makes up for a 22-mile walk.
Sure, it's not as nice as the one you had, but... thought you and I could restore it together?
I'll be your apprentice.
Like the list you sent from the sub?
I did a good job following the instructions, right?
It's something we could do together with our clothes on.
Do not... shrink me.
And I am not very comfortable with you having in-depth conversations with my father.
I'm just making an effort to be a good friend.
If I tell you to get me a 3/8 wrench, and you get a 5/16, I will hit you with it.
Deal.
So wait a minute.
You're-you're going to college and you're ten?
I know we've got our marching orders from Cooper regarding Ray.
But...
I learned a bit about following orders today-- about being robotic is not always the best course.
Well, despite what Cooper said,
I don't think she's the kind of person who'd mind.
Ensign Nathan said that he felt there was a variable within me that makes me not as, uh, logical as I think I am.
I'm not sure I agree, but, uh, I have noticed that some of my decision-making isn't the same as it used to be.
I'm trying to determine what's causing the shift.
Any theories?
Contact with humanity.
It's confusing.
I made a decision today that saved nine people's lives by lying.
I always thought that emotional decisions might compromise Scorpion's survival, but today they led to survival.
Maybe it's worth, uh, rethinking other conclusions that I've come to regarding avoiding... emotions.
RALPH:
Mom!
I decided this is the class I want-
- Robotics.
It makes the most sense to start out with something logical and uncomplicated.
I think, uh...
I think he's right.
Robotics is the smart choice... for now.
Robotics it is.
Uh, but not for everything.

You don't have to pack up your stuff.

She's just so cold and mechanical.

WOMAN:
Hello?
Excuse me.
Can we help you?
Deputy Homeland Director Katherine Cooper.
Where is...
Molina?
I'm Scorpion's Homeland liaison now.
Deputy director.
Downgrade.
She cutting our funding, too?
Your funding is intact.
She just doesn't want to... interact with you, because of the prior... interaction.
SYLVESTER:
She wanted to leave me to die in a jail.
She's easily alienated.
TOBY:
You seem edgy.
Why are you so edgy?
I'm not edgy.
I'm just...
I'm pressed for time, and I have a classified mission to assign.
And it smells so bad in here.
Is that... intentional?
That is Toby.
Because this is a black operation, my information is need-to-know.
Walter O'Brien, Cabe Gallo, Happy Quinn, join me in my SUV.
TOBY:
Hmm.
You heading north or south?
Ooh, eye flutter on "south."
Huntington,
Long Beach, San Pedro...
San Pedro it is, meaning water.
SYLVESTER:
The ports.
A frigate?
Can we leave now?
And you can only take three of the team, so space is an issue.
A submarine.
It's a submarine, isn't it?
Anyway, Homeland needs
Scorpion's help for a black-ops nuclear submarine mission deep in international waters off the coast of California?
Ooh.
WALTER:
They'll be needing me to code?
I'll get my laptop.
HAPPY:
And I will be building something, so I'll get my tools.
SYLVESTER:
And I will get my party hat because I don't have to go on a submarine.
CABE:
And I'll be going to keep anyone from wanting to kill them.
Welcome to Scorpion.
I'm still reading an edge.
What's up with that?
You just disclosed details on a classified mission.
I just need to know that you'll keep this confidential.
What's confidential?
Who's this?
Uh, he's, um, my... my friend.
RAY:
Hey, buddy.
SYLVESTER:
He's using my mug.
He's staying here?
You need to get...
Mr. Saigon out of here.
Things are dicey between Scorpion and Director Molina, and you can't afford any more... issues.
Walter, we never discussed Ray staying in the Airstream, and he doesn't present a professional image, so...
You got to go.
For the good of the team.
RAY:
Okay.
Just need to get the Grem out of lockdown and then...
on my way.
I'll take you to the lot.
Sweet.
Thank you.
Actually, if you could drive my car back, I would... appreciate it.
They won't release a car in the impound lot to someone with a suspended license, which...
I don't even understand that.
Oh, this just keeps getting better.
That's your new friend, and you're just gonna kick him to the curb?
Just like that?
Yes.
I am surrounded by robots.
Now that we have some privacy...
We don't.
I'm on comms with the team.
We'll stay that way on the sub, piggybacking on the antennae.
COOPER:
Fine.
But... under no circumstances will you disclose the location of the sub once you're on board.
The Navy insists that remains classified.
50 bucks I can figure out their exact location anyway.
You want to bet?
It's a bet.
We got a bet?
You have a serious problem.
No duh.
COOPER:
We're going to San Pedro to ferry you out to a special ops nuclear sub.
The mission is to analyze a Vulture, an ocean floor data hunter, attached to an underwater fiber optic cable on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
Attached by whom?
Not yet determined.
But the device is tapping a highly secure line between the United States Department of Defense and the Chinese government in Shanghai.

MAN:
WelcomeaboardtheXB-4.
I'm Captain Steven Jones.
This is Ensign Nathan Hall, our Bullgeorge.
He'll be looking after you riders during this mission.
We have eight other crew members in the Forward Operational Compartment.
Ballast tank, trim tank, reactor control, turbine control.
It's gearhead heaven.
JONES:
And all highly classified.
What you see here stays here.
This mission is top secret.
No one outside of Langley knows our objective or location.
Captain, we're rigged for dive.
Very well.
Take the conn, submerge the ship.
I have the conn!
Ahead two-thirds.
Dive, dive, dive.
Five-degree down bubble.
Make your depth 200 feet.
Come left to course 270.
This, uh, crew is different from most of the military we have worked with.
We get 18 months of training before ever seeing the inside of a sub.
A lot of us here are nuclear engineers.
It makes the hierarchy a little different from the rest of the military.
We do have a saying,
"When hundreds of feet below, the power goes to he who knows."
Or she.
Or she.
Zing.
Happy.
Great use of her humor programming.
I need to check on the crew.
Give me just a second.
TOBY:
Walter, what's your speed?
Uh, I estimate about 20 knots.
My lunch.
It's conveniently shaped.
And our best way of figuring out their location.
They left San Pedro at 8:25.
(whooshing sound)
Roughly 20 knots for 30 minutes.
Sub would head for closest, deepest water.
That would be right off the Palos Verdes shelf break.
Putting you 15 miles east of Catalina Island.
WALTER:
Miss.
Ah.
See, I don't like the mojo of playing Battleship with an actual battleship.
It's not Battleship.
It's Battle Sub.
32 degrees north...
(whistles) 117 degrees west.
(whooshing sound)
Point Loma?
Call that a hit.
Walter,
I'm gonna sink your battle sub.
Please, don't harm the pickles.
NATHAN:
Hey, we're dark.
No outgoing communication.
Half my team's on the mainland.
They will be the only half not incarcerated if information is leaked.
Your orders to disallow communications are illogical.
Toby and Sylvester are part of this team.
I have my orders.
You have my instructions.
And you will follow them.
(crunch)
I think Captain just Crunched their comms.
I'm picking up bits and pieces, but I can barely make anything out.
Follow me.
I thought they were supposed to be working with us.
Military protocol doesn't have a lot of flexibility.
Let's say we toe the line.
("Flea Market Montgomery" song playing) I still can't make anything out.
This cancels our bet.
No bet.
Bet off.
Whatever.
I'm just trying to enjoy my off time.

He is not my husband.

Just a few forms to fill out.
Pen.
I'll handle it.
Cool.
NATHAN:
Let's see if you're worth your salt.
The rods and clamps I affixed to the main jib will act like the arms of an arthroscopic surgery device.
Extending now.
We'llusethecamera to find the communication port on the listening device.
There.
Not bad.
WALTER:
Access port exposed.
Happy, connect the cable.
And we're in.
Uploading their interface.
Toby calls us robots, but, tell me, what's more fascinating than a robot?
Oh, he endlessly analyzes feelings,
Sylvester is a mess of feelings, Paige helps us sort them.
But without the metal gears of the machine, it doesn't run.
CABE:
I guess my role is to kick the machine when it starts talking and doesn't focus.
NATHAN:
We've analyzed the exterior construction of the device-- Swiss metalwork, Dutch wiring-- but no clue as to who put it there.
I'm in the main interface.
I thought this would take an hour at least.
Why are you stopping?
That seemed a little too easy.
Happy, detach the cabling for the device.
Aye, aye.
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of a mission, damn near the end.
My instinct says that this is a dummy interface, a lure to draw us into the system to plant some malware onto your sub or something worse.
Worse like what?
Aborting the mission requires a direct order from the captain.
Then get it, fast, 'cause I have a feeling we want to be as far away from that device as possible.
Walter, tell me what's happening.
Sir.

JONES:

Something's wrong.
Come on, Happy.
Not funny.
I told you we shouldn't have played Battle Sub.
NATHAN:
Reactor's scrammed.
We've lost propulsion.
Lost depth control.
Prepare for impact!
We're gonna hit the ocean floor!
Is everyone okay?
WALTER:
Fine.
HAPPY:
Good.
How did this happen?
There was an explosive device on the Vulture to keep it from being hacked or captured.
We need to do a vessel diagnostic.
HAPPY:
I'll help.
Electric has failed.
Engines have failed.
We're settled at a 40-degree angle.
Well, the size of the blast was likely enough to flood the compartments between here and the rest of the crew.
Communications are out.
And my team doesn't know where we are because you killed our comms.
It gets worse.
The Navy won't know that we're missing until we don't arrive at our rendezvous point in six hours, and for security purposes only the people on the submarine know the course that was charted.
(tapping in Morse code)
Thank God they're alive.
(tapping in Morse code continues)
"Electric down.
"Trying to get the hatch open.
We're compromised."
(tapping in Morse code continues)
"No generator."
No oxygen system.
The shared ventilation system provides all of us with roughly 150 cubic feet of oxygen.
Divide that by 13, each consuming 1.5 cubic feet of oxygen per hour, we have one hour and ten minutes of oxygen left.
CABE:
I'm a Marine-- I spent a lot of time on a ship.
You have immersion suits down here for underwater escape.
Uh, we do, but not in this compartment.
Then we need to get a message out.
Where's the communications panel?
Maybe I can fix it.
No, we're supposed to be running silent.
I believe our directive has changed.
The communications?
In the bow, past that bulkhead.
CABE:
Let me go check.
We're gonna need all hands.
All hands.
Happy, come in.
XB-4, come in.
TOBY:
Yes, I'm here.
I don't care what meeting she's in.
Tell Director Cooper there's an emergency.
Giving me the runaround.
Then run around her.
We're gonna go see this Cooper.
Your car is in the shop.
That was painful.
This whole experience has been painful.
Odd.
Most people who come in here are real upbeat.
(phone ringing) There you go.
Your keys.
You've got good news for me, right?
I've won the lottery?
Wrong.
Where are the keys to your car?
I need them now.
They're in my purse.
Then you need to go to Cooper's office right now.
I'm gonna explain later, but Cabe, Walter and Happy are in serious trouble.
Okay.
Where the hell is he?
Ray!
I got to go!
Oh, God.
Hey, they got doughnuts in the break room.
Paige?
Okay.
(metallic creaking)
(panting):
The water is freezing.
Yeah, well, at this depth the temperature can't be more than 28 degrees.
You have an interesting breadth of knowledge.
The entire system was shorted in the explosion.
I've circumvented a number of blown circuits to see if there's any way to bring this back to life.
Okay, Cabe, on my call, hit the breaker on the wall.
Go.
(electric humming)
We good?
(electric crackling)
HAPPY:
We are not good!
Keep it out of the water, or we're all dead!
(electric crackling)
(grunts)
(gasping breaths)
That was close.
It's fried.
We have zero communication with the surface.
TOBY:
The only way we'regonnafindthem is if we pinpoint their location.
Before they went dark, we had Point Loma.
Walter said they were at 20 knots.
I'm saying good guess.
This is an arc representing 35 minutes, 22 knots from Point Loma.
We don't know exactly where the secret underwater cable is that connects the U.S. and China, but if it follows a similar route to the Trans-Pacific Express cable...
And there's... a very rough guess as to the whereabouts of our sub.
With a bite taken out of it.
(tires screech)
Oh...
God.
(phone rings)
Yeah, I'm here.
What do you have?
The rough coordinates for Cooper-- I'm texting them now.
(tapping in Morse code)
They're saying the sub has listed too far.
The silt is blocking their port hatch.
They can't get out.
Ask them from now on to keep it to good news only.
I will not suggest that to the captain.
So they have the escape suits in their compartment and no way out, and we have a way out but no escape suits.
Even if we did have the immersion suits, it's doubtful we could survive in water this cold.
You'd have ten minutes before severe hypothermia set in, and that's if you made it to the surface.
Which is highly unlikely, given that we're 300 feet down.
What's the depth rating of those survival suits?
225 feet.
Here.
NATHAN:
There seems to be some kind of plan forming here, and as commanding officer,
I'm the one who should be making these decisions.
Well, I thought the power goes to he who knows.
And we know how to build one of those suits from scratch.
You just listed all the ways that it's certain death.
Sitting here is certain death-- what we're talking about is just likely death.
I should volunteer then.
I'll go.
I'm the biggest and most immune to hypothermia.
You know if you leave, there's a good chance that you die before any of us.
I'm the most expendable.
I can't risk Happy and you.
And you know the sub.
Greater good.
Greater good.
COOPER:
TheNavyisn'tgoingtosend a rescue unless the sub misses its rendezvous or there's proof of failure.
The Navy has absolutely no evidence there's anything gone wrong with this mission.
We were in communication with the sub when it went down.
Well, I told them that.
They're of the opinion your team was listening in on an illegal signal that just happened to break down.
Nothing to warrant a rescue mission.
My people are smarter than your people.
I have coordinates for where the sub might be.
You don't want to wake up tomorrow knowing you could have helped save 13 people who died because you followed the rules.
I feel like the Michelin Man.
WALTER:
Okay, Cabe, once you reach the surface...
You have one cartridge.
Parachute flare-- visible for 30 miles.
When you get help, get the Navy to send a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle out of San Diego.
Regardless of where we're at, it'll take at least 150 minutes to get here.
We'll be out of oxygen.
HAPPY:
After you get rescued-- and you will get rescued-- you get this list to Toby.
It's everything they'll need to make an oxygen tank they can load down to us.
It'll give us enough air to stay alive until the rescue.
All contingent, of course, on you surviving the ascent.
I hadn't thought about that for a second.
Thanks for the reminder.
Okay, exhale slowly and continuously on your way up.
You won't have to worry about the bends, because the sub has the same air pressure as the surface.
Should be a quick trip up.
You'll have ten minutes from when you enter the water until hypothermia and, uh... death.
Buck up, kiddo.
Didn't you join the Navy for adventure?
He should be breaking the surface now.
If he's not, he's drowning.
(gasping)
God... please let this work.
If we don't hear from Cabe soon, one of us will go up next.
No pressure suits?
I don't like the odds of making it to the surface.
Versus the odds of death in here?
We have 40 minutes of air left.
OFFICER:
I'm two nautical miles intothesearchzone.
Haven't seen anything.
They've been searching 15 minutes and only covered three percent of the target zone.
Your coordinates cover 50 square miles of open ocean.
It's gonna take a while.
Toby, you got to narrow it down.
TOBY:
We're working with a half-eaten hoagie and a piece of chalk.
It's not like we're mind readers.
What it is like... is a mini mall.
You have finally gone insane.
No, the video I was watching.
♪ Aw, yeah, come shop ♪
♪ With us ♪
While you were guessing locations,
I was watching that video.
When you made your second guess to Walter, he was singing, ♪ It's just like ♪
♪ It's just like a mini mall. ♪
And when you made your third and correct guess, he was saying living rooms, dinettes.
The time between those two lyrics is 14 seconds.
We now know the distance they traveled between two spots and how long it took 'em to cover that ground.
Which gives us their accurate speed, not a guess.
15.38 knots, not 20.
Walter overestimated.
Their location is 117.03 west and 32.05 north.
I'm way out of range of those new coordinates, but there is a commercial vessel in that area.
I'll reach out to them.
Where are you going?
I'm getting us a chopper and getting us on that rescue boat.
(beeps)
(deep horn blares)
Help!
(clanging)
Did you hear that?
Cabe.
Oh, that tough son of a bitch made it.
Thank God.
Sir, phone.
SYLVESTER:
Cabe, we can't believe you're alive.
CABE:
We can celebrate later.
If we want to save the others, we got to work fast.
I need an air tank the size of a hot water heater, a winch from a tow truck, three brass circa 1935-40 electric fans, a waterproof box, a GoPro camera, a 14-inch diameter pipe and a battery pack.
Real quick-- how did Happy suggest we get this stuff?
Mr. Quinn.
Fellas.
Been a while.
No time to chat.
Happy's in trouble, we need your help and a load of equipment.
Starting with the winch on your tow truck.
We got to move fast.
Paige'll be here with the chopper in ten minutes.
Chopper?
(tapping)
They don't know how much longer they can last.
I didn't know you knew Morse code.
I didn't before I got on the sub, but I figured it out.
Our time frame for the oxygen supply didn't account for the deeper breathing caused by fear.
I'm ashamed to say that my breathing might be similarly impacted right now.
But somehow...
yours doesn't seem to be.
We're not military.
We take our orders from math and science.
Right now we know the odds of survival are slim, but we know that mathematically there's a chance.
Some people call us robotic, mechanical.
(tapping resumes) But in situations like this, our constitution is a benefit.
"Still safer than an airplane"?
Why is he communicating that?
We know subs are safer because there are more airplanes in the water than submarines in the sky.
Why would a submarine be in the sky?
It makes no sense.
Somehow they're managing to joke.
Humor-- at a time like this-- that isn't something a captain would normally order.
Not standard operating procedure.
So strict adherence to protocol isn't always the best... tack.
What are you getting at?
An unconventional solution.
Okay.
Uh...
Now, mathematically, their lives-- yours and Happy's as well-- are collectively more valuable than mine.
Are the oxygen levels getting to you now, O'Brien?
If we flood the chamber with an exact amount of water, we can cause the sub to correct position, freeing the trapped sailors' hatch.
Just 18 degrees would be enough to get the hatch out of the silt.
The others have immersion suits-- they could leave via the hatch, reaching the surface.
This chamber-- the one that we're in-- is a closed space.
If we flood it even partially, the rising water will compress the air above it.
We breathe in that compressed air, we can no longer swim to the surface like Cabe did.
We'll die from the bends.
We're trapped.
That is right.
We'll need to leave in a pressurized chamber.
That means waiting for a sub rescue that we don't have enough oxygen to wait for.
That's why we should make you both improvised suits like we did for Cabe.
You both leave and I will flood the chamber.
Nine people escape the boat, oxygen usage drops, leaving me a few more minutes of air.
Anyone could make the same calculations.
I don't think anyone else makes that calculation, and you still won't have enough air to keep you alive until rescue comes.
In order to flood this compartment with the exact amount of water, you need to close the hatch, too.
That is a two-person job.
I'm staying.
No.
I can figure out a way to get it...
I'm staying.
And you'll need a Navy person to work the locking device.
It's really a three-person job.
Three of us working together maximizes the odds of success.
(helicopter blades whirring)
How did my quiet day turn into this?
Come on.
Time's a-wasting.
When the water gets to this level, we close the hatch, okay?
Ready?
Okay.
One, two... (grunts)
Damn it!
Not good.
That's just what Happy says.
(all grunting)
Come on.
Lean into it!
(grunting)
Not smooth, but effective.
I hope so.
I had to guess the silt density.
(laughs) We're shifting.
Whoa!
(laughs) (tapping)
It worked!
Their hatch is clear.
"Thank you.
And Godspeed."
I have to agree that personality-wise you don't seem too similar.
She can be very, uh, rigid.
She was chatty when she was really young.
She was talking in full sentences at seven months old.
I got her a dollhouse when she wasn't even three yet.
She put in her own wiring with working lights.
I was terrified it was gonna be a fire hazard.
I... pulled them all out.
Next day, she rewired it.
Had to take it away.
That's about when she started getting quiet.
I should've just let her do what she was gonna do.
(grunts)
You like my daughter, don't you?
I love your daughter.
All right.
Then just let her do what she's gonna do.
One more should do it.
Thank you.
You okay?
(sighs) Honestly?
No.
This is my first day on the field.
I'm in the middle of the ocean, on a trawler, trying to save lives.
It just might be too big a first bite for a desk jockey.
Before Scorpion, I was a waitress.
Feeling overwhelmed is part of the job, but it's a job I learned I can handle.
You'll learn, too.
Guys?
JONES:
Yes!
Yes!
(whoops)
Either the ocean is lousy with mermen or those are our submariners!
Get these men out of the water!
(tapping)
The crew made it.
WALTER:
Hopefully your tank's on its way, Happy.
So now our lives are in Toby's hands.
(panting)
Fantastic.
SYLVESTER:
They're still stuck down there without enough oxygen.
Three people use six liters per minute, seven if they're stressed, which, of course, they are.
There are 122 liters of oxygen left, which is 17 minutes, give or take a few seconds.
Rescue sub's 35 minutes out.
The tank that we made gives them 45 minutes of oxygen.
If this works, it saves their lives.
We're hooked up!
Let's go!
(whirring)
Dear God, let this work.
There it is!
My daughter's in there.
In case we don't make it out of here,
I just want to say
I'm not really a robot.
Thank you for clarifying.
I did know you weren't made of circuitry.
We both play a good game of denial.
It might be the one thing where I can beat you, but right now my dad is up there trying to save me.
A man I've been looking for for 25 years.
I just never expected to want to live as badly as I do right now.
I saved nine sailors' lives instead of us.
I... supported that act with calculations.
But perhaps there was... some sentimentality attached.
And, uh, you let that certifiable lunatic stay in our garage.
(chuckles)
Uh...
Maybe we're changing.
Maybe... maybe I'm not a robot either.
You're not normal people, are you?
(creaking)
Greetings submerged.
Toby Curtis here, talking to you underwater.
If you can hear me, open the sub's garbage chute.
We're connecting an oxygen tank now.
So, if you feel a little bump, that's just us.
If you can't hear me, it means you're already dead.
SYLVESTER:
Don't say that.
Oh, God.
TOBY:
If they're goners, whatever I say won't mean a poot.
SYLVESTER:
You're still recording.
Okay, you heard him.
Yeah, let's get to it.
Okay, I don't see the disposal unit opening.
Come on!
There!
Forward!
Now!
(door clacks open)
They did it!
I have never been so happy to smell garbage.
Ah, some nice solders there.
Wiring's not great.
A good sized tank.
Overall, I'd rate the craftsmanship as pretty good.
Okay, so, how big's the tank?
About eight feet by three feet.
Can we use this tank as a getaway vehicle?
There's not enough propulsion with the three of us in it.
The tank would never even make it to the surface.
It would just sit there, suspended about 100 feet off the bottom.
Yeah, but the tank gives us 298 cubic liters of 20% oxygen.
Should be enough for about 45 more minutes.
(sniffing) Something wrong?
The-the-the...
the air.
Smells like the fridge in our garage.
It's sulfur.
I thought it was coming from the trash, but it's not.
It's coming from underneath this compartment.
It's lead/acid batteries.
The seawater must have leaked in, caused a chemical reaction that produced sulfur.
Ah, the sulfur's not the problem.
The same reaction could also produce chloride.
That's the problem.
What are you doing?
Walter's right.
It's chloride.
Okay.
I've been around enough batteries to know breathing in that stuff will dissolve your lungs.
Okay, so, we don't have 45 minutes anymore.
It's more like five.
Okay, sailor, we're down, but we're not out!
Ensign?
What are you going?
There's a very specific protocol on this sub.
Self-destruct?
If our enemies capture this sub, its technology could be used to kill thousands of Americans or our allies.
In the event that the craft is disabled, the last officer on board has to initiate the sequence.
HAPPY:
But the Navy's on their way.
They'll recover the ship.
Yeah, but what if they can't?
What if they run into logistical problems, which is very possible?
What if whoever planted the device that we came here for tries to get it as soon as we leave?
That's why the protocol's in place, and that's why we have to follow it.
What's the maximum countdown for the self-destruct protocol?
Maximum five minutes.
Initiate countdown.
In five minutes, either the air fills with poison, or we explode.
(alarm blaring)
Guess we got to get out of here in four and a half.
(alarm sounding) HAPPY:
Walt, we've got less than a minute now.
This is when you normally think of something brilliant, so how's that coming?
!
An escape pod.
The oxygen tank could be used as an escape pod.
I asked for brilliant.
I already told you there's too many bodies for buoyancy.
We're just sit gonna there in the water.
Yeah, normally we would, but in our present circumstances, we're likely to be propelled upward from the blast.
You really think we can ride the explosion of this submarine?
Yes.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Or we die.
Okay, look, get up the trash chute and into the tank.
Come on, Happy, let's go.
(grunting)
Go.
Go.
(grunting)
It's not gonna be comfortable.
Okay, you go.
I need to make sure the ship goes down.
So you're gonna rigidly adhere to the rules even if it costs you your life?
!
It's my duty.
Your duty is to save as many lives as possible.
That includes your own.
Okay?
Okay?
!
Okay, okay.
You first.
All right.
Okay.
(grunts)
(panting)
Come on!
Come on!
I don't fit!
Come on.
Okay, just relax.
Relax?
Why?
It's an out-of-the-box solution, and it may sting a little.
(crack) Aah!
Yeah.
Aah!
You can fit through the hole now.
Oh!
All right, Happy, get us out of here.
Just reversing the spin on these fans!
Any way we can go any faster?
No.
Now shut up and brace yourself.
(coughing)
Just talked to the rescue sub.
Ten minutes out.
(seagulls cawing)
(explosion)
(water gurgling)
Oh, no.
Happy.
Cabe, tell me this didn't just happen.
HAPPY:
Hey, dummies!
A little help?
!
They're alive.
Thank God.
Couldn't have done it without you, desk jockey.
Good work, fellas.
I just wanted to say, uh, thank you.
You know, you're a... you're a hero.
Well, I'm not a hero.
It's just math.
I don't know.
One thing I've learned about you is you don't always live by the numbers.
Sometimes you trust yourself, believe in your team despite the numbers.
There's another variable in there that you're not copping to.
Hey.
Let's go downstairs.
I want to show you something.
TOBY:
There he is.
Big Ray!
Where you been?
I just hitchhiked from Gardena.
TOBY:
Whoa.
RAY:
Yeah, I guess
I'm not normally a person people stop for, so...
Ray?
Hi.
Hey.
I'm...
Excuse me, fellas.
Ray, I'm sorry I ditched you this morning.
We...
It was an emergency.
Not a problem.
In fact, I saved you a doughnut.
Here.
Oh.
Still hungry.
I just...
Thanks.
Um, how about I, um...
I get you a burger?
Please sit.
Yeah?
A burger?
Want to sit down?
Yeah, sounds great.
Makes up for a 22-mile walk.
Sure, it's not as nice as the one you had, but... thought you and I could restore it together?
I'll be your apprentice.
Like the list you sent from the sub?
I did a good job following the instructions, right?
It's something we could do together with our clothes on.
Do not... shrink me.
And I am not very comfortable with you having in-depth conversations with my father.
I'm just making an effort to be a good friend.
If I tell you to get me a 3/8 wrench, and you get a 5/16, I will hit you with it.
Deal.
So wait a minute.
You're-you're going to college and you're ten?
I know we've got our marching orders from Cooper regarding Ray.
But...
I learned a bit about following orders today-- about being robotic is not always the best course.
Well, despite what Cooper said,
I don't think she's the kind of person who'd mind.
Ensign Nathan said that he felt there was a variable within me that makes me not as, uh, logical as I think I am.
I'm not sure I agree, but, uh, I have noticed that some of my decision-making isn't the same as it used to be.
I'm trying to determine what's causing the shift.
Any theories?
Contact with humanity.
It's confusing.
I made a decision today that saved nine people's lives by lying.
I always thought that emotional decisions might compromise Scorpion's survival, but today they led to survival.
Maybe it's worth, uh, rethinking other conclusions that I've come to regarding avoiding... emotions.
RALPH:
Mom!
I decided this is the class I want-
- Robotics.
It makes the most sense to start out with something logical and uncomplicated.
I think, uh...
I think he's right.
Robotics is the smart choice... for now.
Robotics it is.
Uh, but not for everything.
Ray?
You don't have to pack up your stuff.
You can stay as long as you want.
Sweet.
Thanks.
Absolutely, buddy.
Wow.
Well, hey, let's get this party started!

Hello?
Excuse me.
Can we help you?
Deputy Homeland Director Katherine Cooper.
Where is...
Molina?
I'm Scorpion's Homeland liaison now.
Deputy director.
Downgrade.
She cutting our funding, too?
Your funding is intact.
She just doesn't want to... interact with you, because of the prior... interaction.
She wanted to leave me to die in a jail.
She's easily alienated.
You seem edgy.
Why are you so edgy?
I'm not edgy.
I'm just...
I'm pressed for time, and I have a classified mission to assign.
And it smells so bad in here.
Is that... intentional?
That is Toby.
Because this is a black operation, my information is need-to-know.
Walter O'Brien, Cabe Gallo, Happy Quinn,
- join me in my SUV.
- Hmm.
You heading north or south?
Ooh, eye flutter on "south."
Huntington,
Long Beach, San Pedro...
San Pedro it is, meaning water.
The ports.
A frigate?
Can we leave now?
And you can only take three of the team, so space is an issue.
A submarine.
It's a submarine, isn't it?
Anyway, Homeland needs
Scorpion's help for a black-ops nuclear submarine mission deep in international waters off the coast of California?
Ooh.
They'll be needing me to code?
I'll get my laptop.
And I will be building something, so I'll get my tools.
And I will get my party hat because I don't have to go on a submarine.
And I'll be going to keep anyone from wanting to kill them.
Welcome to Scorpion.
I'm still reading an edge.
What's up with that?
You just disclosed details on a classified mission.
I just need to know that you'll keep this confidential.
What's confidential?
Who's this?
Uh, he's, um, my... my friend.
Hey, buddy.
He's using my mug.
He's staying here?
You need to get...
Mr. Saigon out of here.
Things are dicey between Scorpion and Director Molina, and you can't afford any more... issues.
Walter, we never discussed Ray staying in the Airstream, and he doesn't present a professional image, so...
You got to go.
For the good of the team.
Okay.
Just need to get the Grem out of lockdown and then...
on my way.
I'll take you to the lot.
Sweet.
Thank you.
Actually, if you could drive my car back, I would... appreciate it.
They won't release a car in the impound lot to someone with a suspended license, which...
I don't even understand that.
Oh, this just keeps getting better.
That's your new friend, and you're just gonna kick him to the curb?
Just like that?
Yes.
I am surrounded by robots.
Now that we have some privacy...
We don't.
I'm on comms with the team.
We'll stay that way on the sub, piggybacking on the antennae.
Fine.
But... under no circumstances will you disclose the location of the sub once you're on board.
The Navy insists that remains classified.
50 bucks I can figure out their exact location anyway.
You want to bet?
It's a bet.
We got a bet?
You have a serious problem.
No duh.
We're going to San Pedro to ferry you out to a special ops nuclear sub.
The mission is to analyze a Vulture, an ocean floor data hunter, attached to an underwater fiber optic cable on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
Attached by whom?
Not yet determined.
But the device is tapping a highly secure line between the United States Department of Defense and the Chinese government in Shanghai.
Happy, we need you to build an extension to the submarine's arm.
We'll use it to tap a cable from Walter's computer into the listening device.
Walter, you'll hack into the device's mainframe and identify whoever is intercepting our communications.
Welcome aboard the XB-4.
I'm Captain Steven Jones.
This is Ensign Nathan Hall, our Bullgeorge.
He'll be looking after you riders during this mission.
We have eight other crew members in the Forward Operational Compartment.
Ballast tank, trim tank, reactor control, turbine control.
It's gearhead heaven.
And all highly classified.
What you see here stays here.
This mission is top secret.
No one outside of Langley knows our objective or location.
Captain, we're rigged for dive.
Very well.
Take the Conn, submerge the ship.
I have the Conn!
Ahead two-thirds.
Dive, dive, dive.
Five-degree down bubble.
Make your depth 200 feet.
Come left to course 270.
This, uh, crew is different from most of the military we have worked with.
We get 18 months of training before ever seeing the inside of a sub.
A lot of us here are nuclear engineers.
It makes the hierarchy a little different from the rest of the military.
We do have a saying,
"When hundreds of feet below, the power goes to he who knows""
Or she.
Or she.
Zing.
Happy.
Great use of her humor programming.
I need to check on the crew.
Give me just a second.
Walter, what's your speed?
Uh, I estimate about 20 knots.
My lunch.
It's conveniently shaped.
And our best way of figuring out their location.
They left San Pedro at 8:25.
Roughly 20 knots for 30 minutes.
Sub would head for closest, deepest water.
That would be right off the Palos Verdes shelf break.
Putting you 15 miles east of Catalina Island.
Miss.
Ah.
See, I don't like the mojo of playing Battleship with an actual battleship.
It's not Battleship.
It's Battle Sub.
32 degrees north... 117 degrees west.
Point Loma?
Call that a hit.
Walter,
I'm gonna sink your battle sub.
Please, don't harm the pickles.
Hey, we're dark.
No outgoing communication.
Half my team's on the mainland.
They will be the only half not incarcerated if information is leaked.
Your orders to disallow communications are illogical.
Toby and Sylvester are part of this team.
I have my orders.
You have my instructions.
And you will follow them.
I think Captain just Crunched their comms.
I'm picking up bits and pieces, but I can barely make anything out.
Follow me.
I thought they were supposed to be working with us.
Military protocol doesn't have a lot of flexibility.
Let's say we toe the line.
I still can't make anything out.
This cancels our bet.
No bet.
Bet off.
Whatever.

Let's see if you're worth your salt.

We'll use the camera to find the communication port on the listening device.
There.
Not bad.
Access port exposed.
Happy, connect the cable.
And we're in.
Uploading their interface.
Toby calls us robots, but, tell me, what's more fascinating than a robot?
Oh, he endlessly analyzes feelings,
Sylvester is a mess of feelings, Paige helps us sort them.
But without the metal gears of the machine, it doesn't run.
I guess my role is to kick the machine when it starts talking and doesn't focus.
We've analyzed the exterior construction of the device-- Swiss metalwork, Dutch wiring-- but no clue as to who put it there.
I'm in the main interface.
I thought this would take an hour at least.
Why are you stopping?
That seemed a little too easy.
Happy, detach the cabling for the device.
Aye, aye.
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of a mission, damn near the end.
My instinct says that this is a dummy interface, a lure to draw us into the system to plant some malware onto your sub or something worse.
Worse like what?
Aborting the mission requires a direct order from the captain.
Then get it, fast, 'cause I have a feeling we want to be as far away from that device as possible.
Walter, tell me what's happening.

Is everyone okay?
Fine.
Good.
How did this happen?
There was an explosive device on the Vulture to keep it from being hacked or captured.
We need to do a vessel diagnostic.
I'll help.
Electric has failed.
Engines have failed.
We're settled at a 40-degree angle.
Well, the size of the blast was likely enough to flood the compartments between here and the rest of the crew.
Communications are out.
And my team doesn't know where we are because you killed our comms.
It gets worse.
The Navy won't know that we're missing until we don't arrive at our rendezvous point in six hours, and for security purposes only the people on the submarine know the course that was charted.
Thank God they're alive.
"Electric down.
"Trying to get the hatch open.
We're compromised."
"No generator."
No oxygen system.
The shared ventilation system provides all of us with roughly 150 cubic feet of oxygen.
Divide that by 13, each consuming 1.5 cubic feet of oxygen per hour, we have one hour and ten minutes of oxygen left.
I'm a Marine-- I spent a lot of time on a ship.
You have immersion suits down here for underwater escape.
Uh, we do, but not in this compartment.
Then we need to get a message out.
Where's the communications panel?
Maybe I can fix it.
No, we're supposed to be running silent.
I believe our directive has changed.
The communications?
In the bow, past that bulkhead.
Let me go check.
We're gonna need all hands.
All hands.
Happy, come in.
XB-4, come in.
Yes, I'm here.
I don't care what meeting she's in.
Tell Director Cooper there's an emergency.
Giving me the runaround.
Then run around her.
We're gonna go see this Cooper.
Your car is in the shop.
That was painful.
This whole experience has been painful.
Odd.
Most people who come in here are real upbeat.
There you go.
Your keys.
You've got good news for me, right?
I've won the lottery?
Wrong.
Where are the keys to your car?
I need them now.
They're in my purse.
Then you need to go to Cooper's office right now.
I'm gonna explain later, but Cabe, Walter and Happy are in serious trouble.
Okay.
Where the hell is he?
Ray!
I got to go!
Oh, God.
Hey, they got doughnuts in the break room.
Paige?
Okay.
The water is freezing.
Yeah, well, at this depth the temperature can't be more than 28 degrees.
You have an interesting breadth of knowledge.
The entire system was shorted in the explosion.
I've circumvented a number of blown circuits to see if there's any way to bring this back to life.
Okay, Cabe, on my call, hit the breaker on the wall.
Go.
We good?
We are not good!
Keep it out of the water, or we're all dead!
That was close.
It's fried.
We have zero communication with the surface.
The only way we're gonna find them is if we pinpoint their location.
Before they went dark, we had Point Loma.
Walter said they were at 20 knots.
I'm saying good guess.
This is an arc representing 35 minutes, 22 knots from Point Loma.
We don't know exactly where the secret underwater cable is that connects the U.S. and China, but if it follows a similar route to the Trans-Pacific Express cable...
And there's... a very rough guess as to the whereabouts of our sub.
With a bite taken out of it.
Oh...
God.
Yeah, I'm here.
What do you have?
The rough coordinates for Cooper-- I'm texting them now.
They're saying the sub has listed too far.
The silt is blocking their port hatch.
They can't get out.
Ask them from now on to keep it to good news only.
I will not suggest that to the captain.
So they have the escape suits in their compartment and no way out, and we have a way out but no escape suits.
Even if we did have the immersion suits, it's doubtful we could survive in water this cold.
You'd have ten minutes before severe hypothermia set in, and that's if you made it to the surface.
Which is highly unlikely, given that we're 300 feet down.
What's the depth rating of those survival suits?
225 feet.
Here.
There seems to be some kind of plan forming here, and as commanding officer,
I'm the one who should be making these decisions.
Well, I thought the power goes to he who knows.
And we know how to build one of those suits from scratch.
You just listed all the ways that it's certain death.
Sitting here is certain death-- what we're talking about is just likely death.
I should volunteer then.
I'll go.
I'm the biggest and most immune to hypothermia.
You know if you leave, there's a good chance that you die before any of us.
I'm the most expendable.
I can't risk Happy and you.
And you know the sub.
Greater good.
Greater good.
The Navy isn't going to send a rescue unless the sub misses its rendezvous or there's proof of failure.
The Navy has absolutely no evidence there's anything gone wrong with this mission.
We were in communication with the sub when it went down.
Well, I told them that.
They're of the opinion your team was listening in on an illegal signal that just happened to break down.
Nothing to warrant a rescue mission.
My people are smarter than your people.
I have coordinates for where the sub might be.
You don't want to wake up tomorrow knowing you could have helped save 13 people who died because you followed the rules.
I feel like the Michelin Man.
Okay, Cabe, once you reach the surface...
You have one cartridge.
Parachute flare-- visible for 30 miles.
When you get help, get the Navy to send a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle out of San Diego.
Regardless of where we're at, it'll take at least 150 minutes to get here.
We'll be out of oxygen.
After you get rescued-- and you will get rescued-- you get this list to Toby.
It's everything they'll need to make an oxygen tank they can load down to us.
It'll give us enough air to stay alive until the rescue.
All contingent, of course, on you surviving the ascent.
I hadn't thought about that for a second.
Thanks for the reminder.
Okay, exhale slowly and continuously on your way up.
You won't have to worry about the bends, because the sub has the same air pressure as the surface.
Should be a quick trip up.
You'll have ten minutes from when you enter the water until hypothermia and, uh... death.
Buck up, kiddo.
Didn't you join the Navy for adventure?
He should be breaking the surface now.
If he's not, he's drowning.
God... please let this work.
If we don't hear from Cabe soon, one of us will go up next.
No pressure suits?
I don't like the odds of making it to the surface.
Versus the odds of death in here?
We have 40 minutes of air left.
I'm two nautical miles into the search zone.
Haven't seen anything.
They've been searching 15 minutes and only covered three percent of the target zone.
Your coordinates cover 50 square miles of open ocean.
It's gonna take a while.
Toby, you got to narrow it down.
We're working with a half-eaten hoagie and a piece of chalk.
It's not like we're mind readers.
What it is like... is a mini mall.
You have finally gone insane.
No, the video I was watching.
♪ Aw, yeah, come shop ♪
♪ With us ♪
While you were guessing locations,
I was watching that video.
When you made your second guess to Walter, he was singing, ♪ It's just like ♪
♪ It's just like a mini mall. ♪
And when you made your third and correct guess, he was saying living rooms, dinettes.
The time between those two lyrics is 14 seconds.
We now know the distance they traveled between two spots and how long it took 'em to cover that ground.
Which gives us their accurate speed, not a guess.
15.38 knots, not 20.
Walter overestimated.
Their location is 117.03 west and 32.05 north.
I'm way out of range of those new coordinates, but there is a commercial vessel in that area.
I'll reach out to them.
Where are you going?
I'm getting us a chopper and getting us on that rescue boat.
Help!
Did you hear that?
Cabe.
Oh, that tough son of a bitch made it.
Thank God.
Sir, phone.
Cabe, we can't believe you're alive.
We can celebrate later.
If we want to save the others, we got to work fast.
I need an air tank the size of a hot water heater, a winch from a tow truck, three brass circa 1935-40 electric fans, a waterproof box, a GoPro camera, a 14-inch diameter pipe and a battery pack.
Real quick-- how did Happy suggest we get this stuff?
Mr. Quinn.
Fellas.
Been a while.
No time to chat.
Happy's in trouble, we need your help and a load of equipment.
Starting with the winch on your tow truck.
We got to move fast.
Paige'll be here with the chopper in ten minutes.
Chopper?
They don't know how much longer they can last.
I didn't know you knew Morse code.
I didn't before I got on the sub, but I figured it out.
Our time frame for the oxygen supply didn't account for the deeper breathing caused by fear.
I'm ashamed to say that my breathing might be similarly impacted right now.
But somehow...
yours doesn't seem to be.
We're not military.
We take our orders from math and science.
Right now we know the odds of survival are slim, but we know that mathematically there's a chance.
Some people call us robotic, mechanical.
But in situations like this, our constitution is a benefit.
"Still safer than an airplane"?
Why is he communicating that?
We know subs are safer because there are more airplanes in the water than submarines in the sky.
Why would a submarine be in the sky?
It makes no sense.
Somehow they're managing to joke.
Humor-- at a time like this-- that isn't something a captain would normally order.
Not standard operating procedure.
So strict adherence to protocol isn't always the best... tack.
What are you getting at?
An unconventional solution.
Okay.
Uh...
Now, mathematically, their lives-- yours and Happy's as well-- are collectively more valuable than mine.
Are the oxygen levels getting to you now, O'Brien?
If we flood the chamber with an exact amount of water, we can cause the sub to correct position, freeing the trapped sailors' hatch.
Just 18 degrees would be enough to get the hatch out of the silt.
The others have immersion suits-- they could leave via the hatch, reaching the surface.
This chamber-- the one that we're in-- is a closed space.
If we flood it even partially, the rising water will compress the air above it.
We breathe in that compressed air, we can no longer swim to the surface like Cabe did.
We'll die from the bends.
We're trapped.
That is right.
We'll need to leave in a pressurized chamber.
That means waiting for a sub rescue that we don't have enough oxygen to wait for.
That's why we should make you both improvised suits like we did for Cabe.
You both leave and I will flood the chamber.
Nine people escape the boat, oxygen usage drops, leaving me a few more minutes of air.
Anyone could make the same calculations.
I don't think anyone else makes that calculation, and you still won't have enough air to keep you alive until rescue comes.
In order to flood this compartment with the exact amount of water, you need to close the hatch, too.
That is a two-person job.
I'm staying.
No.
I can figure out a way to get it...
I'm staying.
And you'll need a Navy person to work the locking device.
It's really a three-person job.
Three of us working together maximizes the odds of success.
How did my quiet day turn into this?
Come on.
Time's a-wasting.
When the water gets to this level, we close the hatch, okay?
Ready?
Okay.
One, two...
Damn it!
Not good.
That's just what Happy says.
Come on.
Lean into it!
Not smooth, but effective.
I hope so.
I had to guess the silt density.
We're shifting.
Whoa!
It worked!
Their hatch is clear.
"Thank you.
And Godspeed."
I have to agree that personality-wise you don't seem too similar.
She can be very, uh, rigid.
She was chatty when she was really young.
She was talking in full sentences at seven months old.
I got her a dollhouse when she wasn't even three yet.
She put in her own wiring with working lights.
I was terrified it was gonna be a fire hazard.
I... pulled them all out.
Next day, she rewired it.
Had to take it away.
That's about when she started getting quiet.
I should've just let her do what she was gonna do.
You like my daughter, don't you?
I love your daughter.
All right.
Then just let her do what she's gonna do.
One more should do it.
Thank you.
You okay?
Honestly?
No.
This is my first day on the field.
I'm in the middle of the ocean, on a trawler, trying to save lives.
It just might be too big a first bite for a desk jockey.
Before Scorpion, I was a waitress.
Feeling overwhelmed is part of the job, but it's a job I learned I can handle.
You'll learn, too.
Guys?
Yes!
Yes!
Either the ocean is lousy with mermen or those are our submariners!
Get these men out of the water!
The crew made it.
Hopefully your tank's on its way, Happy.
So now our lives are in Toby's hands.
Fantastic.
They're still stuck down there without enough oxygen.
Three people use six liters per minute, seven if they're stressed, which, of course, they are.
There are 122 liters of oxygen left, which is 17 minutes, give or take a few seconds.
Rescue sub's 35 minutes out.
The tank that we made gives them 45 minutes of oxygen.
If this works, it saves their lives.
We're hooked up!
Let's go!
Dear God, let this work.
There it is!
My daughter's in there.
In case we don't make it out of here,
I just want to say
I'm not really a robot.
Thank you for clarifying.
I did know you weren't made of circuitry.
We both play a good game of denial.
It might be the one thing where I can beat you, but right now my dad is up there trying to save me.
A man I've been looking for for 25 years.
I just never expected to want to live as badly as I do right now.
I saved nine sailors' lives instead of us.
I... supported that act with calculations.
But perhaps there was... some sentimentality attached.
And, uh, you let that certifiable lunatic stay in our garage.
Uh...
Maybe we're changing.
Maybe... maybe I'm not a robot either.
You're not normal people, are you?
Greetings submerged.
Toby Curtis here, talking to you underwater.
If you can hear me, open the sub's garbage chute.
We're connecting an oxygen tank now.
So, if you feel a little bump, that's just us.
If you can't hear me, it means you're already dead.
Don't say that.
- Oh, God.
- If they're goners, whatever I say won't mean a poot.
You're still recording.
Okay, you heard him.
Yeah, let's get to it.
Okay, I don't see the disposal unit opening.
Come on!
There!
Forward!
Now!
They did it!
I have never been so happy to smell garbage.
Ah, some nice solders there.
Wiring's not great.
A good sized tank.
Overall, I'd rate the craftsmanship as pretty good.
Okay, so, how big's the tank?
About eight feet by three feet.
Can we use this tank as a getaway vehicle?
There's not enough propulsion with the three of us in it.
The tank would never even make it to the surface.
It would just sit there, suspended about 100 feet off the bottom.
Yeah, but the tank gives us 298 cubic liters of 20% oxygen.
Should be enough for about 45 more minutes.
Something wrong?
The-the-the...
the air.
Smells like the fridge in our garage.
It's sulfur.
I thought it was coming from the trash, but it's not.
It's coming from underneath this compartment.
It's lead/acid batteries.
The seawater must have leaked in, caused a chemical reaction that produced sulfur.
Ah, the sulfur's not the problem.
The same reaction could also produce chloride.
That's the problem.
What are you doing?
Walter's right.
It's chloride.
Okay.
I've been around enough batteries to know breathing in that stuff will dissolve your lungs.
Okay, so, we don't have 45 minutes anymore.
It's more like five.
Okay, sailor, we're down, but we're not out!
Ensign?
What are you going?
There's a very specific protocol on this sub.
Self-destruct?
If our enemies capture this sub, its technology could be used to kill thousands of Americans or our allies.
In the event that the craft is disabled, the last officer on board has to initiate the sequence.
But the Navy's on their way.
They'll recover the ship.
Yeah, but what if they can't?
What if they run into logistical problems, which is very possible?
What if whoever planted the device that we came here for tries to get it as soon as we leave?
That's why the protocol's in place, and that's why we have to follow it.
What's the maximum countdown for the self-destruct protocol?
Maximum five minutes.
Initiate countdown.
In five minutes, either the air fills with poison, or we explode.
Guess we got to get out of here in four and a half.
Walt, we've got less than a minute now.
This is when you normally think of something brilliant, so how's that coming?
!
An escape pod.
The oxygen tank could be used as an escape pod.
I asked for brilliant.
I already told you there's too many bodies for buoyancy.
We're just sit gonna there in the water.
Yeah, normally we would, but in our present circumstances, we're likely to be propelled upward from the blast.
You really think we can ride the explosion of this submarine?
Yes.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Or we die.
Okay, look, get up the trash chute and into the tank.
Come on, Happy, let's go.
Go.
Go.
It's not gonna be comfortable.
Okay, you go.
I need to make sure the ship goes down.
So you're gonna rigidly adhere to the rules even if it costs you your life?
!
It's my duty.
Your duty is to save as many lives as possible.
That includes your own.
Okay?
Okay?
!
Okay, okay.
You first.
All right.
Okay.
Come on!
Come on!
I don't fit!
Come on.
Okay, just relax.
Relax?
Why?
It's an out-of-the-box solution, and it may sting a little.
Aah!
Yeah.
Aah!
You can fit through the hole now.
Oh!
All right, Happy, get us out of here.
Just reversing the spin on these fans!
Any way we can go any faster?
No.
Now shut up and brace yourself.
Just talked to the rescue sub.
Ten minutes out.
Oh, no.
Happy.
Cabe, tell me this didn't just happen.
Hey, dummies!
A little help?
!
They're alive.
Thank God.
Couldn't have done it without you, desk jockey.
Good work, fellas.
I just wanted to say, uh, thank you.
You know, you're a... you're a hero.
Well, I'm not a hero.
It's just math.
I don't know.
One thing I've learned about you is you don't always live by the numbers.
Sometimes you trust yourself, believe in your team despite the numbers.
There's another variable in there that you're not copping to.
Hey.
Let's go downstairs.
I want to show you something.
There he is.
Big Ray!
Where you been?
I just hitchhiked from Gardena.
- Whoa.
- Yeah, I guess
I'm not normally a person people stop for, so...
Ray?
Hi.
Hey.
I'm...
Excuse me, fellas.
Ray, I'm sorry I ditched you this morning.
We...
It was an emergency.
Not a problem.
In fact, I saved you a doughnut.
Here.
Oh.
Still hungry.
I just...
Thanks.
Um, how about I, um...
I get you a burger?
Please sit.
Yeah?
A burger?
Want to sit down?
Yeah, sounds great.
Makes up for a 22-mile walk.
Sure, it's not as nice as the one you had, but... thought you and I could restore it together?
I'll be your apprentice.
Like the list you sent from the sub?
I did a good job following the instructions, right?
It's something we could do together with our clothes on.
Do not... shrink me.
And I am not very comfortable with you having in-depth conversations with my father.
I'm just making an effort to be a good friend.
If I tell you to get me a 3/8 wrench, and you get a 5/16, I will hit you with it.
Deal.
So wait a minute.
You're-you're going to college and you're ten?
I know we've got our marching orders from Cooper regarding Ray.
But...
I learned a bit about following orders today-- about being robotic is not always the best course.
Well, despite what Cooper said,
I don't think she's the kind of person who'd mind.
Ensign Nathan said that he felt there was a variable within me that makes me not as, uh, logical as I think I am.
I'm not sure I agree, but, uh, I have noticed that some of my decision-making isn't the same as it used to be.
I'm trying to determine what's causing the shift.
Any theories?
Contact with humanity.
It's confusing.
I made a decision today that saved nine people's lives by lying.
I always thought that emotional decisions might compromise Scorpion's survival, but today they led to survival.
Maybe it's worth, uh, rethinking other conclusions that I've come to regarding avoiding... emotions.
Mom!
I decided this is the class I want-
- Robotics.
It makes the most sense to start out with something logical and uncomplicated.
I think, uh...
I think he's right.
Robotics is the smart choice... for now.
Robotics it is.
Uh, but not for everything.
Ray?
You don't have to pack up your stuff.
You can stay as long as you want.
Sweet.
Thanks.
Absolutely, buddy.
Wow.
Well, hey, let's get this party started!
Pardon.
Oh.

- They're gonna kill me!
- I know I saw you on June 13th.
You are the only one who can tell me what really happened.
Molly!
No!
With our processor now online,
EPIC can locate every enhanced human on this planet.
It's a trap!
They found us!
God!
Why is this happening to me?
_
_
How long you been following us?
Who is that man you were talking to?
We have to go, Tommy.
_
How do we find our true purpose?
Is it something we're born with, written into our genetic code?
Or is it something we must learn over time, a growing awareness derived from life's joys and sorrows?
Mom?
From our loves...
Our losses,our achievements, and our suffering.
Mom, Mom, it's okay.
I'm here.
I just wanted some more time with you.
Mom, it's fine, I'm gonna get you to a hospital, okay?
No.
It's too dangerous.
Go.
- No, no, no.
- Go.
Mom?
Nursing supervisor to the O.R.
- She's feeling better.
- Any available nursing...
Hey there.
What can I do for you?
Alexander French?
Yeah, that's right.
Whoo-hoo!
My God, that was a pretty shot.
Did you see how his body crumpled before his eyes even realized he was dead?
Luke, I asked you a question.
Yeah, honey, that was a really pretty shot.
But this man, he had a family.
This man was a monster.
With a wife and a kid.
Who are safer now that we acted.
Or maybe we're just making assumptions because his name was on some list.
We don't know anything about these people.
He could've been a teacher, a doctor, I mean--
Come on.
Assalamu'alaikum wabarakatuh.
Assalamu'alaikum wabarakatuh.
It's time to head south, isn't it?
Good.
I'm ready.
Watch yourself, child.
I know grown men who would shake in their boots if they knew the fate of the world was in their hands.
Good thing I'm not a grown man.

We are on our way to America, but we can't fulfill our quest without your help.
So if you love Evernow as much as I do, dress up as your favorite character and meet us tomorrow morning at the gates of Renautas in Midian.

Look at these people.
They're digital sheep peddling their free bikes, eating their precious free sushi, completely blind to everything that's going on around them.
You worked here for almost a year before you said anything.
It's really good sushi.
Come on, we got to find a way inside the research lab.
Easier said than done.
Who said anything about easy?
You saw what they did with that device.
With EPIC online, no one is safe.
If they're really sucking out Molly's power, they're probably doing the same thing to Phoebe, turning her into some kind of-- like, a shadow blaster or something.
What?
It's a thing.
It could be a thing.
- Okay.
All right, all right.
- You don't know.
Look, just keep your head low, and do exactly as I say, all right?
If your sister's here, we'll find her.
What you doing?
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
What happened to your face?
Fell down some stairs.
Don't change the subject.
It was Abuelito's.
Don't think it's seen the road in about 20 years though.
Dad promised we'd fix it...together.
It's up to me now.
You did all this?
All it needed was a little upgrade.
Little upgrade?
It's what he would have wanted.
Come here,mijo.
What is it?
Uncle Carlos?
I need to get to school.
Uncle Carlos?
We're gonna need bulletproof glass... and Kevlar, lots of Kevlar.
Gotta try this spicy tuna.
Do I know you?
No, Taylor, but you do know a friend of ours.
What friend is that?
Molly Walker.
You're gonna help us break her out.
Yeah, you are.
What do you know about your mother's research division?
What do you think you're doing?
What kind of security does she have?
Noah Bennet.
The original bag and tagger.
Careful, Taylor.
What kind of mother puts her own daughter into this line of work?
One who trusts me to get the job done.
Or maybe one who doesn't care if you take a bullet.
You know, I almost met your mom once.
June 13th.
Right after the bombing.
All I wanted was one minute so I could ask her face-to-face what happened to my sister.
Security was too tight.
I couldn't get near her, but now, I can get all my answers.
What do you think you'll find out?
She's kidnapping innocent people.
You have no idea what she's trying to accomplish.
And you do?
What is it you think she's trying to accomplish, Taylor?
Locking up human beings?
Torturing them?
- You don't know that.
- But they are human beings,
Taylor.
You must have seen that.
Believe me, all parents will lie to their kids to protect them from the truth.
I am not asking you to betray your mother.
I'm just asking you to question her.
What happened to Francis?
You know, every time I doubt the path I'm on,
I think about you, Taylor.
Mom, can we not drudge up the past for once?
Look, I'm not mad at you for sleeping around.
What upsets me is you would sleep with one of them.
You act like this is just some fling.
- With an Evo.
- With a great guy who I care about a lot.
When did you become such a bigot?
You have no idea what I am or what I'm trying to accomplish here.
Then tell me, Mom.
Bring me in for once.
Why are we rounding these people up?
Did you know that aluminum used to be one of the rarest, most valuable metals in the world?
I asked you a simple question.
In the courts of Napoleon III,
French royalty were served in round plates of solid gold while only the Emperor himself had the honor of eating on a plate of aluminum.
That's how hard it was to come by, and of course a few decades later, a chemist by the name of Charles Martin Hall developed a way to extract aluminum from common dirt at almost no cost, and just like that,
it went from the banquet halls of royalty to the pantries of peasants, all because of one person's creative spark.
This isn't a TED talk, Mom.
Just tell me the truth.
What are you really after?
Abundance, Taylor.
A world of infinite supply so that you never have to suffer through war, hunger, pollution, terrorism, greed.
I mean, all the horrible consequences of an overcrowded, selfish, doomed planet.
But you still haven't answered my question.
Why are we rounding up Evos?
To save our species.
Do you trust me?
Dr. Susan Morris to ICU.
Dr. Susan Morris to ICU.
Tommy!
I'm so glad you're okay.
Dude.
Uh, what are you guys doing here?
A friend gets t-boned by a drunk driver, we're not gonna sit at home with our thumbs up our--
He gets the point, Brad.
We were worried about you.
Oh.
Wow.
Thomas Clark?
Is my mom okay?
She suffered what we call a blunt splenic trauma causing an internal hemorrhage.
But now she's fine, right?
She's stable, but we're still gonna have to do a blood transfusion.
Okay, great.
Let's do it.
- What's wrong?
- We don't have any O-negative blood on supply.
It's quite rare, and ever since the Evos came out, blood donations aren't what they used to be.
What about mine?
You can give her mine, right?
Well, blood relatives are more likely to be a match, but--
Then test it.
Tommy.
She's the only family I have.
I almost forgot what it feels like to sweat.
Isn't it weirdly refreshing?
The Sindhis of Pakistan do not sweat.
We glow so that God may see us better.
Of course you do.
Why are we stopping?
The signs were there just like she said they'd be.
We don't have time to just stop.
Time?
What do you know about time?
I'm not a child anymore, Farah.
Have you ever wondered why we kept you hidden in the Arctic?
They've been hunting you, Malina.
Ever since your first birthday, our enemies have been searching for you with only one thing in mind-- death, which is why we must fight them back with life.
_
Calm down.
Calm down, sir.
We pose you no threat.
I need help out here now!
Yeah, there are these two--
Training is over.
What's the matter with you?
It's gorgeous out.
I've been fighting this wicked headache the last couple days, so-- no, no, it just--it just-- it feels better in the dark.
Take a bloody aspirin.
No, I'll be fine.
Look, babe, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and...
I think maybe I should sit out this next appointment.
Maybe you should too.
Maybe we both should.
We could--I don't know, we could rent a boat and watch the sunset, and maybe open a bottle of wine, be normal like we used to be.
Normal?
It's not too late.
Oh.
Feels like the surface of the sun.
Yeah, like I said, my head--
No wonder you're not yourself.
Here.
Get some rest, drink plenty of fluids, and I will pick you up some meds on the way back.
We used to be a part of something special, weren't we?
Things always look better in the rear view.
No, we were happy.
I know we were.
Things change, Luke.
You gotta keep changing with them.
Joanne.
What?
I still love you.
It's beautiful, isn't it, when nature's so unpredictable?
Do they have any idea what's really coming?
I hope not, for their sake.
But I'm just one person.
What if I can't save them all by myself?
You're not alone, Malina.
You'll have help, even if the others don't know it yet.

What did you do to the suit?
Meet version 2.0.
You might want to stand back.
So you made yourself a fancy costume.
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Yeah, a little.
Become a man who's fit to wear it, then I'll be impressed.
I'm not doing this for you, Father... or for Oscar.
Then why don the mask?
'Cause for once, I want to believe in something bigger than me.
Captain Dearing will be looking for you.
I have a feeling he might be onto me as well.
I will just have to get to him first.
Mom, don't get mad, but...
I had my blood tested to see if we were a match.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I risk exposing who I am?
But I had no choice.
The test results came back.
And?
You weren't a match.
How could I not be?
It's never a sure thing, even amongst family members.
So what do we do?
Well, the closest blood bank with her type is in South Bend, Indiana.
I can put in an order, but it could take up to six hours.
Tommy, is there something you want to tell me?
About what?
What happened in there?
She still needs blood.
Tommy, where are you going?
Indiana.
Want to come?
Sorry, cleared employees only.
But you do know who I am?
Yes, Ms. Kravid.
Good, then you should've seen this coming.
Now let's find Molly.
We're close.
Molly's in here somewhere.
We don't want to shoot you, but we will if necessary.
"We"?
That's the guy that took my sister, or at least one of them is.
Hit the ground on the count of three.
- Wait, what?
- One...
What if they know where she is?
- Two...
- I hate your face, Bennet.
Three.
How are we not pausing to have a conversation about this?
You just saw that, right?
Right?
Three dudes just kind of crumbled into piles of kosher salt?
Welcome to my world.
I'm telling you, this list of Evos has been a godsend.
Remember the first one we killed?
Of course.
Afterward, you were so content.
You were so blissfully satisfied.
I have...never seen anyone sleep so soundly.
I spent the rest of that night hunched over a toilet.
Why are you saying this now?
We lost our son, Joanne, and for the last year, I've been so terrified that I would lose you too, and the truth is I have lost you.
I have lost myself.
We have lost each other.
What the hell?
If you want to do it, do it.
I really did love you.
You ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary?
I work at an ice cream parlor in Carbondale, Illinois.
An extraordinary ice cream parlor.
Look, the thing is, Emily, I-I do get that feeling, all the time, and it sucks.
There's, like, 1,000 pounds of pressure weighing me down, reminding me that I'm different.
Good.
Good?
You are different, Tommy.
You'll always be different, but trust me, the moment you accept that, you're gonna start having way more fun.
Now...
let's go save your mom.
Oh, my gosh.
We totally just--
I am so never flying commercial again.
We have the blood!
- You have to run!
- What?
Your blood test went straight to a federal database.
They know what you are.
I'll take care of your mom, but you have to run.
Now!
Let's go.
You know what you have to do.
There are people watching.
Tommy, don't worry about them for once.
Just be you.
Be extraordinary.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Clark, not if you want your mother to get that blood you were so kind to deliver.
Uncle Carlos.
I was thinking we could add some performance cylinder heads.
You did it!
It sounds great.
Hey, can I come with you?
Ah, too dangerous.
I want to push it up to 100.
Nothing's gonna happen.
I'll be fine.
I know,mijo,but...
I need you here holding down the fort.
You're not going to believe this.
My dad, El Vengador.
Just slow down.
I used to be so afraid to show him what I could do, but this whole time, we could've been a team.
Jose!
_
Well, look who we got here.
Two for one special.
Run, Jose!
Go!
Find your uncle!
Come here!
I got the kid!
Holy--
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
There she is.
It's Katana Girl!
Phoebe?
Phoebe?
- Are these all--
- Evos.
They were smart enough not to go to Odessa on June 13th, but they still couldn't hide from your mother.
Oh, my God, Francis.
What did she do to him?
Plotting bitch.
I once knew a man...
who could harvest people's powers through their brains.
He collected them, used them for his own ends, but I think your mother has found another way.
Noah?
Noah.
Molly.
Molly.
You're gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be all right.
There's no stopping it.
Every machine has an off switch.
Not this one.
I swear I didn't know what she was doing.
I'm so sorry.
What?
What is it?
You should've never found me.
Molly.
I'm just here to help.
People have been telling me that my entire life, but all they want to do is use me for my powers.
You should understand that better than anyone.
I'm not proud of my past.
You know if I could change it--
Forget about the past, Noah.
This is about so much more than you and me and June 13th.
I was there in the hospital when your daughter died.
What happened?
We all knew what was at stake, and we agreed to do whatever was necessary to keep them safe.
- No--no!
- What are you doing?
Erica tried to take everything from me, but I was strong.
I was really strong, and I didn't give her the location.
Of what?
If I tell you, you won't go back, and then we're all dead anyway.
You're not making any sense.
I can't stop Erica, but I will not help her kill 7 billion people.
What?
Molly, put the gun down, and let's talk, okay?
You're the only one who can tell me what really happened on June 13th.
Forget the past, Noah.
Save the future.
Molly, just--
We can't leave her like this.
If we don't, we're gonna end up just like her.
Come on, man.
We got to go.
Find them.
They can't be far.
We just lost Molly Walker, gunshot wound, self-inflicted.
How exactly did she manage to get her hands on a gun?
Security ID'd Noah Bennet, and... well, there's no way to put this delicately.
He was with your daughter.
Bring them to me.
What about EPIC?
Local tracking still functions properly.
As long as you're within 100 feet of an Evo, they'll all register on the device.
But remote locations?
Not without the girl.
At least tell me we found it before she died.
Lovely.
It's only the future of the entire human race hanging in the balance.
Before global tracking went down, EPIC did pick up a signal in Canada that showed some potential.
It's too late for potential, Mr. Harris.
I need you to find me that child, and when you do, I need you to kill it.
I'll put my usual team on it.
No.
This is too important.
This time, you're taking the Shadow.
We all havea unique purpose, and try as we might, we cannot run from it.
Will we be able to stay true to who we are, or will we succumb to the pressure of destiny and become something else entirely?
Something inhuman?
Previously on "Heroes Reborn"...
-They're gonna kill me!
-I know I saw you on june 13th.
You are the only one who can tell me what really happened.

No!

He name is Erica.

We have to go, Tommy.
CHAPTER FOUR THE NEEDS OF THE MANY

Mom?
Nursing supervisor to the O.R.
-She's feeling better.
-Any available nursing...
Hey there.
What can I do for you?
Alexander French?
Yeah, that's right.
My god, that was a pretty shot.
Did you see how his body crumpled before his eyes even realized he was dead?
Luke, I asked you a question.
Yeah, honey, that was a really pretty shot.
But this man, he had a family.
This man was a monster.

Come on.
Assalamu'alaikum wabarakatuh.
Assalamu'alaikum wabarakatuh.
It's time to head south, isn't it?
Good.
I'm ready.
Watch yourself, child.
I know grown men who would shake in their boots if they knew the fate of the world was in their hands.
Good thing I'm not a grown man.
-Ren, what are you doing?
-Buying our tickets to America!
A last minute flight will cost over a million Yen.
Money is no object when you're famous, dude.
Okay, maybe not famous-famous.
But I am Internet-famous!
Look.
Two thousands followers waiting for me to start streaming.
And here!
Over a million subscribers!
So are these men or women who like to watch?
What sort of pornography do you do?
No!
It's not..!
Don't listen to him.
I'm a gamer.
People all over the world pay to watch me play online.
And I thought I was strange.
Fellow evernow champions,
I'm here with the daughter of the great Hachiro Otomo, the real-life Katana Girl!
Come on...
Smile!
Stop it!
We are on our way to America, but we can't fulfill our quest without your help.
So if you love evernow as much as I do, dress up as your favorite character and meet us tomorrow morning at the gates of renautas in midian.
Gamers of the world unite.
But how will that help me retrieve the sword and rescue my father from the forces of evil?
Never doubt the power of social media.
Don't worry.
They'll show up.
Look at these people.
They're digital sheep peddling their free bikes, eating their precious free sushi, completely blind to everything that's going on around them.
You worked here for almost a year before you said anything.
It's really good sushi.
Come on, we got to find a way inside the research lab.
Easier said than done.
Who said anything about easy?
You saw what they did with that device.
With epic online, no one is safe.
If they're really sucking out Molly's power, they're probably doing the same thing to Phoebe, turning her into some kind of... like, a shadow blaster or something.
What?
It's a thing.
It could be a thing.
-Okay.
All right, all right.
-You don't know.
Look, just keep your head low, and do exactly as I say, all right?
If your sister's here, we'll find her.
What you doing?
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
What happened to your face?
Fell down some stairs.
Don't change the subject.
It was abuelito's.
Don't think it's seen the road in about 20 years though.
Dad promised we'd fix it...
Together.
It's up to me now.
You did all this?
All it needed was a little upgrade.
Little upgrade?
It's what he would have wanted.
Come here,mijo.
What is it?
Uncle Carlos?
I need to get to school.
Uncle Carlos?
We're gonna need bulletproof glass...
And kevlar, lots of kevlar.
Gotta try this spicy tuna.
Do I know you?
No, Taylor, but you do know a friend of ours.
What friend is that?
Molly Walker.
You're gonna help us break her out.
Yeah, you are.
What do you know about your mother's research division?
What do you think you're doing?
What kind of security does she have?
Noah Bennet.
The original bag and tagger.
Careful, Taylor.
What kind of mother puts her own daughter into this line of work?
One who trusts me to get the job done.
Or maybe one who doesn't care if you take a bullet.
You know, I almost met your mom once.
June 13th.
Right after the bombing.
All I wanted was one minute so I could ask her face-to-face what happened to my sister.
Security was too tight.
I couldn't get near her, but now, I can get all my answers.
What do you think you'll find out?
She's kidnapping innocent people.
You have no idea what she's trying to accomplish.
And you do?
What is it you think she's trying to accomplish, Taylor?
Locking up human beings?
Torturing them?
-You don't know that.
-But they are human beings,
Taylor.
You must have seen that.
Believe me, all parents will lie to their kids to protect them from the truth.
I am not asking you to betray your mother.
I'm just asking you to question her.
What happened to Francis?
You know, every time I doubt the path I'm on,
I think about you, Taylor.
Mom, can we not drudge up the past for once?
Look, I'm not mad at you for sleeping around.
What upsets me is you would sleep with one of them.
You act like this is just some fling.
-With an evo.
-With a great guy who I care about a lot.
When did you become such a bigot?
You have no idea what I am or what I'm trying to accomplish here.
Then tell me, mom.
Bring me in for once.
Why are we rounding these people up?
Did you know that aluminum used to be one of the rarest, most valuable metals in the world?
I asked you a simple question.
In the courts of Napoleon III,
French royalty were served in round plates of solid gold while only the emperor himself had the honor of eating on a plate of aluminum.
That's how hard it was to come by, and of course a few decades later, a chemist by the name of Charles Martin hall developed a way to extract aluminum from common dirt at almost no cost, and just like that,
it went from the banquet halls of royalty to the pantries of peasants, all because of one person's creative spark.
This isn't a Ted talk, mom.
Just tell me the truth.
What are you really after?
Abundance, Taylor.
A world of infinite supply so that you never have to suffer through war, hunger, pollution, terrorism, greed.
I mean, all the horrible consequences of an overcrowded, selfish, doomed planet.
But you still haven't answered my question.
Why are we rounding up evos?
To save our species.
Do you trust me?
Dr. Susan Morris to icu.
Dr. Susan Morris to icu.
Tommy!
I'm so glad you're okay.
Dude.
What are you guys doing here?
A friend gets t-boned by a drunk driver, we're not gonna sit at home with our thumbs up our... he gets the point, Brad.
We were worried about you.
Wow.
Thomas Clark?
Is my mom okay?
She suffered what we call a blunt splenic trauma causing an internal hemorrhage.
But now she's fine, right?
She's stable, but we're still gonna have to do a blood transfusion.
Okay, great.
Let's do it.
-What's wrong?
-We don't have any o-negative blood on supply.
It's quite rare, and ever since the evos came out, blood donations aren't what they used to be.
What about mine?
You can give her mine, right?
Well, blood relatives are more likely to be a match, but... then test it.
Tommy.
She's the only family I have.
I almost forgot what it feels like to sweat.
Isn't it weirdly refreshing?
The sindhis of Pakistan do not sweat.
We glow so that god may see us better.
Of course you do.
Why are we stopping?
The signs were there just like she said they'd be.
We don't have time to just stop.
Time?
What do you know about time?
I'm not a child anymore, farah.
Have you ever wondered why we kept you hidden in the arctic?
They've been hunting you, Malina.
Ever since your first birthday, our enemies have been searching for you with only one thing in mind... death, which is why we must fight them back with life.
Earth.
Calm down.
Calm down, sir.
We pose you no threat.
I need help out here now!
Yeah, there are these two... training is over.
What's the matter with you?
It's gorgeous out.
I've been fighting this wicked headache the last couple days, so...
No, no, it just... it just...
it feels better in the dark.
Take a bloody aspirin.
No, I'll be fine.
Look, babe, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and...
I think maybe I should sit out this next appointment.
Maybe you should too.
Maybe we both should.
We could...
I don't know, we could rent a boat and watch the sunset, and maybe open a bottle of wine, be normal like we used to be.
Normal?
It's not too late.
Feels like the surface of the sun.
Yeah, like I said, my head...
No wonder you're not yourself.
Here.
Get some rest, drink plenty of fluids, and I will pick you up some meds on the way back.
We used to be a part of something special, weren't we?
Things always look better in the rear view.
No, we were happy.
I know we were.
Things change, Luke.
You gotta keep changing with them.
Joanne.
What?
I still love you.
It's beautiful, isn't it, when nature's so unpredictable?
Do they have any idea what's really coming?
I hope not, for their sake.
But I'm just one person.
What if I can't save them all by myself?
You're not alone, Malina.
You'll have help, even if the others don't know it yet.
Miko, you haven't said a word since we took off.
I can't stop thinking about what that man said about Yamagato Tower.
You mean about being dead?
If you were dead you'd be a zombie, but you don't feel like a zombie.
Ren, this is no joke.
Plus you just ate pretzels.
A zombie doesn't eat pretzels when there are so many delicious humans.
Then why would that man say that?
I don't know, Miko.
And I don't care.
Because the girl I know is very much alive.
He said my father had the same power.
Hachiro Otomo could leap into his video games?
No wonder his games are so realistic!
He lived in them!
That's why he was captured and taken into Evernow.
And olnly you can save him.
It's your destiny, Miko!
Lucky me.
What if I fail him?
Chin up, Katana Girl.
If the quest wasn't hard, it wouldn't be heroic.
What did you do to the suit?
Meet version 2.0.
You might want to stand back.
So you made yourself a fancy costume.
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Yeah, a little.
Become a man who's fit to wear it, then I'll be impressed.
I'm not doing this for you, father...
Or for Oscar.
Then why don the mask?
'Cause for once, I want to believe in something bigger than me.
Captain dearing will be looking for you.
I have a feeling he might be onto me as well.
I will just have to get to him first.
Mom, don't get mad, but...
I had my blood tested to see if we were a match.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I risk exposing who I am?
But I had no choice.
The test results came back.
And?
You weren't a match.
How could I not be?
It's never a sure thing, even amongst family members.
So what do we do?
Well, the closest blood bank with her type is in south bend, Indiana.
I can put in an order, but it could take up to six hours.
Tommy, is there something you want to tell me?
About what?
What happened in there?
She still needs blood.
Tommy, where are you going?
Indiana.
Want to come?
Sorry, cleared employees only.
But you do know who I am?
Yes, Ms. kravid.
Good, then you should've seen this coming.
Now let's find Molly.
We're close.
Molly's in here somewhere.
We don't want to shoot you, but we will if necessary.
"We"?
That's the guy that took my sister, or at least one of them is.
Hit the ground on the count of three.
-Wait, what?
-One...
What if they know where she is?
-Two...
-I hate your face, Bennet.
Three.
How are we not pausing to have a conversation about this?
You just saw that, right?
Right?
Three dudes just kind of crumbled into piles of kosher salt?
Welcome to my world.
I'm telling you, this list of evos has been a godsend.
Remember the first one we killed?
Of course.
Afterward, you were so content.
You were so blissfully satisfied.
I have...
Never seen anyone sleep so soundly.
I spent the rest of that night hunched over a toilet.
Why are you saying this now?
We lost our son, joanne, and for the last year, I've been so terrified that I would lose you too, and the truth is I have lost you.
I have lost myself.
We have lost each other.
What the hell?
If you want to do it, do it.
I really did love you.
You ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary?
I work at an ice cream parlor in carbondale, Illinois.
An extraordinary ice cream parlor.
Look, the thing is, Emily, I-I do get that feeling, all the time, and it sucks.
There's, like, 1,000 pounds of pressure weighing me down, reminding me that I'm different.
Good.
Good?
You are different, Tommy.
You'll always be different, but trust me, the moment you accept that, you're gonna start having way more fun.
Now...
Let's go save your mom.
My gosh.
We totally just...
I am so never flying commercial again.
We have the blood!
-You have to run!
-What?
Your blood test went straight to a federal database.
They know what you are.
I'll take care of your mom, but you have to run.
Now!
Let's go.
You know what you have to do.
There are people watching.
Tommy, don't worry about them for once.
Just be you.
Be extraordinary.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Clark, not if you want your mother to get that blood you were so kind to deliver.
Uncle Carlos.
I was thinking we could add some performance cylinder heads.
You did it!
It sounds great.
Hey, can I come with you?
Too dangerous.
I want to push it up to 100.
Nothing's gonna happen.
I'll be fine.
I know,mijo,but...
I need you here holding down the fort.
You're not going to believe this.
My dad, El vengador.
Just slow down.
I used to be so afraid to show him what I could do, but this whole time, we could've been a team.
Jose!
What were you afraid to show him?
Well, look who we got here.
Two for one special.
Run, Jose!
Go!
Find your uncle!
Come here!
I got the kid!
Holy...
Are you sure this will help me recover my father's sword?
Trust me, Miko.
My plan is already in motion.
With all the Katana Girls around... it will be easy to infiltrate Renautas.
All I need to do is backflip over this fence, defeat any hostile guards, and destroy the main gate from within so that you can follow.
Or... just take off the sweatshirt.
There she is.
It's Katana Girl!
Phoebe?
Phoebe?
-Are these all...
-Evos.
They were smart enough not to go to Odessa on june 13th, but they still couldn't hide from your mother.
My god, Francis.
What did she do to him?
Plotting bitch.
I once knew a man...
Who could harvest people's powers through their brains.
He collected them, used them for his own ends, but I think your mother has found another way.
Noah?
Noah.
Molly.
Molly.
You're gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be all right.
There's no stopping it.
Every machine has an off switch.
Not this one.
I swear I didn't know what she was doing.
I'm so sorry.
What?
What is it?
You should've never found me.
Molly.
I'm just here to help.
People have been telling me that my entire life, but all they want to do is use me for my powers.
You should understand that better than anyone.
I'm not proud of my past.
You know if I could change it... forget about the past, Noah.
This is about so much more than you and me and june 13th.
I was there in the hospital when your daughter died.
What happened?
We all knew what was at stake, and we agreed to do whatever was necessary to keep them safe.
-No, no!
-What are you doing?
Erica tried to take everything from me, but I was strong.
I was really strong, and I didn't give her the location.
Of what?
If I tell you, you won't go back, and then we're all dead anyway.
You're not making any sense.
I can't stop Erica, but I will not help her kill 7 billion people.
What?
Molly, put the gun down, and let's talk, okay?
You're the only one who can tell me what really happened on june 13th.
Forget the past, Noah.
Save the future.
Molly, just...
We can't leave her like this.
If we don't, we're gonna end up just like her.
Come on, man.
We got to go.
Find them.
They can't be far.
We just lost Molly Walker, gunshot wound, self-inflicted.
How exactly did she manage to get her hands on a gun?
Security ID'd Noah Bennet, and...
Well, there's no way to put this delicately.
He was with your daughter.
Bring them to me.
What about epic?
Local tracking still functions properly.
As long as you're within 100 feet of an evo, they'll all register on the device.
But remote locations?
Not without the girl.
At least tell me we found it before she died.
Lovely.
It's only the future of the entire human race hanging in the balance.
Before global tracking went down, epic did pick up a signal in Canada that showed some potential.
It's too late for potential, Mr. Harris.
I need you to find me that child, and when you do, I need you to kill it.
I'll put my usual team on it.
No.
This is too important.
This time, you're taking the shadow.
We all havea unique purpose, and try as we might, we cannot run from it.
Will we be able to stay true to who we are, or will we succumb to the pressure of Destiny and become something else entirely?
Something inhuman?
NOAH:
Previously on Heroes Reborn...
They're gonna kill me!
NOAH:
I know I saw you on June 13th.
You are the only one who can tell me what really happened.

You might want to stand back.
(HYDRAULIC GEARS WORKING)
So you made yourself a fancy costume.
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Yeah, a little.
Become a man who's fit to wear it, then I'll be impressed.
I'm not doing this for you, Father.
Or for Oscar.
Then why don the mask?
'Cause for once,
I want to believe in something bigger than me.
(SIGHS)
Captain Dearing will be looking for you.
I have a feeling he might be onto me as well.
Then we'll just have to get to him first.
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
Mom, don't get mad, but...
I had my blood tested to see if we were a match.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I risk exposing who I am?
But I had no choice.
(DOOR OPENING)
The test results came back.
And?
You weren't a match.
How could I not be?
It's never a sure thing, even amongst family members.
So what do we do?
Well, the closest blood bank with her type is in South Bend, Indiana.
I can put in an order, but it could take up to six hours.
Tommy, is there something you want to tell me?
About what?
What happened in there?
She still needs blood.
Tommy, where are you going?
Indiana.
Want to come?
Sorry, cleared employees only.
But you do know who I am?
Yes, Ms. Kravid.
Good, then you should've seen this coming.
(BOTH GROANING)
Now let's find Molly.
(BEEPING)
(DOOR BUZZING OPEN)
NOAH:
We're close.
Molly's in here somewhere.
We don't want to shoot you, but we will if necessary.
"We"?
(GUN COCKS)
That's the guy that took my sister, or at least one of them is.
Hit the ground on the count of three.
- Wait, what?
- One.
What if they know where she is?
- Two.
- I hate your face, Bennet.
Three.
(GUNSHOTS)
(GRUNTING)
How are we not pausing to have a conversation about this?
You just saw that, right?
Right?
Three dudes just kind of crumbled into piles of kosher salt?
Welcome to my world.
JOANNE:
I'm telling you, this list of Evos has been a godsend.
Remember the first one we killed?
Of course.
Afterward, you were so content.
You were so blissfully satisfied.
I have never seen anyone sleep so soundly.
I spent the rest of that night hunched over a toilet.
Why are you saying this now?
We lost our son, Joanne, and for the last year, I've been so terrified that I would lose you, too.
And the truth is I have lost you.
I have lost myself.
We have lost each other.
(GASPS)
(TIRES SCREECHING)
If you want to do it, do it.
(BREATHING UNSTEADILY)
(SIGHS)
I really did love you.
You ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary?
(CHUCKLES)
I work at an ice cream parlor in Carbondale, Illinois.
An extraordinary ice cream parlor.
(LAUGHS)
Look, the thing is, Emily, I do get that feeling, all the time, and it sucks.
There's, like, 1,000 pounds of pressure weighing me down, reminding me that I'm different.
Good.
Good?
You are different, Tommy.
You'll always be different.
But trust me, the moment you accept that, you're gonna start having way more fun.
Now... (CHUCKLES)
Let's go save your mom.
Oh, my gosh.
We totally just...
I am so never flying commercial again.
We have the blood.
You have to run.
What?
Your blood test went straight to a federal database.
They know what you are.
I'll take care of your mom, but you have to run.
Now!
Come on.
Let's go.
You know what you have to do.
There are people watching.
Tommy, don't worry about them for once.
Just be you.
Be extraordinary.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Clark.
Not if you want your mother to get that blood you were so kind to deliver.
Uncle Carlos.
I was thinking we could add some performance cylinder heads.
(ENGINE STARTS)
You did it!
It sounds great.
Hey, can I come with you?
Ah, too dangerous.
I want to push it up to 100.
Nothing's gonna happen.
I'll be fine.
I know, mijo, but, uh...
I need you here holding down the fort.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(METAL PART RICOCHETS)
You're not going to believe this.
My dad, El Vengador.
Jose, slow down.
I used to be so afraid to show him what I could do, but this whole time, we could've been a team.
Jose!
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Well, look what we got here.
Two-for-one special.
- Run, Jose.
- But...
Now go!
Find your uncle!
(CRIES OUT)
MAN:
Dearing, I got the kid.
Holy...
(BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE)
There she is.
It's Katana Girl!
(ALL SCREAMING)
Phoebe?
Phoebe?
- Are these all...
- Evos.
They were smart enough not to go to Odessa on June 13th, but they still couldn't hide from your mother.
Oh, my God.
Francis.
What did she do to him?
Plotting bitch.
NOAH:
I once knew a man who could harvest people's powers through their brains.
He collected them, used them for his own ends.
But I think your mother has found another way.
Noah?
Noah.
Molly.
Molly.
You're gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be all right.
(SIGHS) There's no stopping it.
Every machine has an off switch.
Not this one.
TAYLOR:
I swear I didn't know what she was doing.
I'm so sorry.
What?
What is it?
You should've never found me.
Molly.
I'm just here to help.
People have been telling me that my entire life, but all they want to do is use me for my powers.
You should understand that better than anyone.
I'm not proud of my past.
You know if I could change it...
Forget about the past, Noah.
This is about so much more than you and me and June 13th.
I was there in the hospital when your daughter died.
What happened?
(SNIFFLING)
We all knew what was at stake, and we agreed to do whatever was necessary to keep them safe.
- No, no!
- What are you doing?
Erica tried to take everything from me, but I was strong.
(CRYING) I was really strong, and I didn't give her the location.
Of what?
If I tell you, you won't go back.
And then we're all dead anyway.
You're not making any sense.
I can't stop Erica, but I will not help her kill seven billion people.
TAYLOR:
What?
Molly, put the gun down and let's talk, okay?
You're the only one who can tell me what really happened on June 13th.
Forget the past, Noah.
Save the future.
NOAH:
Molly, just... (GUNSHOT) (ALL GASPING)
(SOBBING)
(ALARM BLARING)
We can't leave her like this.
If we don't, we're gonna end up just like her.
Come on, man.
We got to go.
Find them.
They can't be far.
We just lost Molly Walker.
Gunshot wound.
Self-inflicted.
How exactly did she manage to get her hands on a gun?
Security ID'd Noah Bennet, and...
Well, there's no way to put this delicately.
He was with your daughter.
Bring them to me.
What about EPIC?
Local tracking still functions properly.
As long as you're within 100 feet of an Evo, they'll all register on the device.
But remote locations?
Not without the girl.
At least tell me we found it before she died.
(SCOFFS)
Lovely.
It's only the future of the entire human race hanging in the balance.
Before global tracking went down,
EPIC did pick up a signal in Canada that showed some potential.
It's too late for potential, Mr. Harris.
I need you to find me that child.
And when you do, I need you to kill it.
I'll put my usual team on it.
No.
This is too important.
This time, you're taking the Shadow.
SURESH:
We all have a unique purpose, and try as we might, we cannot run from it.
The only question that remains, will we be able to stay true to who we are, or will we succumb to the pressure of destiny and become something else entirely?
Something inhuman?

Who is that man you were talking to?
We have to go, Tommy.

how do we find our true purpose?
Is it something we're born with, written into our genetic code?
Or is it something we must learn over time, a growing awareness derived from life's joys and sorrows?
Mom?
[Groans]
From our loves...
[Groans loudly]
[Dramatic music]
В™є в™є our losses,our achievements, and our suffering.
[Whimpers]
Mom, mom, it's okay.
I'm here.
[Grunts]
I just wanted some more time with you.
Mom, it's fine, I'm gonna get you to a hospital, okay?
[Whimpers] No.
It's too dangerous.
Go.
- No, no, no.
- Go.

Hey there.
What can I do for you?
Alexander French?
Yeah, that's right.
Whoo-hoo!
My god, that was a pretty shot.
Did you see how his body crumpled before his eyes even realized he was dead?
Luke, I asked you a question.
Yeah, honey, that was a really pretty shot.
But this man, he had a family.
This man was a monster.
With a wife and a kid.
Who are safer now that we acted.
Or maybe we're just making assumptions because his name was on some list.
We don't know anything about these people.
He could've been a teacher, a doctor, I mean-- [clatter]

Look at these people.
They're digital sheep peddling their free bikes, eating their precious free Sushi, completely blind to everything that's going on around them.
You worked here for almost a year before you said anything.
It's really good Sushi.
Come on, we got to find a way inside the research lab.
Easier said than done.
Who said anything about easy?
You saw what they did with that device.
With epic online, no one is safe.
If they're really sucking out Molly's power, they're probably doing the same thing to Phoebe, turning her into some kind of-- like, a shadow blaster or something.
What?
It's a thing.
It could be a thing.
- Okay.
All right, all right.
- You don't know.
Look, just keep your head low, and do exactly as I say, all right?
If your sister's here, we'll find her.
What you doing?
[Wrench clattering] Nothing.
don't look like nothing.
What happened to your face?
Fell down some stairs.
don't change the subject.
It was abuelito's.
don't think it's seen the road in about 20 years though.
Dad promised we'd fix it...
Together.
It's up to me now.
You did all this?
All it needed was a little upgrade.
Little upgrade?
It's what he would have wanted.
Come here,mijo.
What is it?
Uncle Carlos?
I need to get to school.
Uncle Carlos?
We're gonna need bulletproof glass...
And kevlar, lots of kevlar.
[Humming]
Gotta try this spicy tuna.
Do I know you?
No, Taylor, but you do know a friend of ours.
What friend is that?
Molly Walker.
You're gonna help us break her out.
Yeah, you are.
What do you know about your mother's research division?
What do you think you're doing?
What kind of security does she have?
Noah Bennet.
The original bag and tagger.
Careful, Taylor.
What kind of mother puts her own daughter into this line of work?
One who trusts me to get the job done.
Or maybe one who doesn't care if you take a bullet.
You know, I almost met your mom once.
June 13th.
Right after the bombing.
All I wanted was one minute so I could ask her face-to-face what happened to my sister.
Security was too tight.
I couldn't get near her, but now, I can get all my answers.
What do you think you'll find out?
She's kidnapping innocent people.
You have no idea what she's trying to accomplish.
And you do?
What is it you think she's trying to accomplish, Taylor?
Locking up human beings?
Torturing them?
- You don't know that.
- But they are human beings,
Taylor.
You must have seen that.
Believe me, all parents will lie to their kids to protect them from the truth.
I am not asking you to betray your mother.
I'm just asking you to question her.
[Eerie humming]
What happened to Francis?
You know, every time I doubt the path I'm on,
I think about you, Taylor.
Mom, can we not drudge up the past for once?
Look, I'm not mad at you for sleeping around.
What upsets me is you would sleep with one of them.
You act like this is just some fling.
- With an evo.
- With a great guy who I care about a lot.
When did you become such a bigot?
You have no idea what I am or what I'm trying to accomplish here.
Then tell me, mom.
Bring me in for once.
Why are we rounding these people up?
Did you know that aluminum used to be one of the rarest, most valuable metals in the world?
I asked you a simple question.
In the courts of Napoleon III,
French royalty were served in round plates of solid gold while only the emperor himself had the honor of eating on a plate of aluminum.
That's how hard it was to come by, and of course a few decades later, a chemist by the name of Charles Martin hall developed a way to extract aluminum from common dirt at almost no cost, and just like that,
it went from the banquet halls of royalty to the pantries of peasants, all because of one person's creative spark.
This isn't a Ted talk, mom.
Just tell me the truth.
What are you really after?
Abundance, Taylor.
A world of infinite supply so that you never have to suffer through war, hunger, pollution, terrorism, greed.
I mean, all the horrible consequences of an overcrowded, selfish, doomed planet.
But you still haven't answered my question.
Why are we rounding up evos?
To save our species.
Do you trust me?
Dr. Susan Morris to icu.
Dr. Susan Morris to icu.
Tommy!
I'm so glad you're okay.
Dude.
Uh, what are you guys doing here?
A friend gets t-boned by a drunk driver, we're not gonna sit at home with our thumbs up our- he gets the point, Brad.
We were worried about you.
Oh.
Wow.
Thomas Clark?
Is my mom okay?
She suffered what we call a blunt splenic trauma causing an internal hemorrhage.
But now she's fine, right?
She's stable, but we're still gonna have to do a blood transfusion.
Okay, great.
Let's do it.
- What's wrong?
- We don't have any o-negative blood on supply.
It's quite rare, and ever since the evos came out, blood donations aren't what they used to be.
What about mine?
You can give her mine, right?
Well, blood relatives are more likely to be a match, but- then test it.
Tommy.
She's the only family I have.
[Chuckles] I almost forgot what it feels like to sweat.
Isn't it weirdly refreshing?
The sindhis of Pakistan do not sweat.
We glow so that god may see us better.
Of course you do.
Why are we stopping?
The signs were there just like she said they'd be.
We don't have time to just stop.
Time?
What do you know about time?
I'm not a child anymore, farah.
Have you ever wondered why we kept you hidden in the arctic?
They've been hunting you, Malina.
Ever since your first birthday, our enemies have been searching for you with only one thing in mind-- death, which is why we must fight them back with life.
[Speaking in urdu] _
calm down.
Calm down, sir.
We pose you no threat.
I need help out here now!
Yeah, there are these two--
- training is over.
What's the matter with you?
It's gorgeous out.
I've been fighting this wicked headache the last couple days, so-- no, no, it just--it just-- it feels better in the dark.
Take a bloody aspirin.
No, I'll be fine.
Look, babe, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and...
I think maybe I should sit out this next appointment.
Maybe you should too.
Maybe we both should.
We could--I don't know, we could rent a boat and watch the sunset, and maybe open a bottle of wine, be normal like we used to be.
Normal?
It's not too late.
Oh.
Feels like the surface of the sun.
Yeah, like I said, my head- no wonder you're not yourself.
Here.
Get some rest, drink plenty of fluids, and I will pick you up some meds on the way back.
We used to be a part of something special, weren't we?
Things always look better in the rear view.
No, we were happy.
I know we were.
Things change, Luke.
You gotta keep changing with them.
Joanne.
What?
I still love you.
[Eerie music]
[Eerie humming]
[Labored breathing]
It's beautiful, isn't it, when nature's so unpredictable?
Do they have any idea what's really coming?
I hope not, for their sake.
But I'm just one person.
What if I can't save them all by myself?
You're not alone, Malina.
You'll have help, even if the others don't know it yet.

Is it something we're born with, written into our genetic code?
Or is it something we must learn over time, a growing awareness derived from life's joys and sorrows?

Look at these people.
They're digital sheep peddling their free bikes, eating their precious free sushi, completely blind to everything that's going on around them.
You worked here for almost a year before you said anything.
It's really good sushi.
Come on, we got to find a way inside the research lab.
Easier said than done.
Who said anything about easy?
You saw what they did with that device.
With EPIC online, no one is safe.
If they're really sucking out Molly's power, they're probably doing the same thing to Phoebe, turning her into some kind of-- like, a shadow blaster or something.
What?
It's a thing.
It could be a thing.
- Okay.
All right, all right.
- You don't know.
Look, just keep your head low, and do exactly as I say, all right?
If your sister's here, we'll find her.
What you doing?
[wrench clattering] Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
What happened to your face?
Fell down some stairs.
Don't change the subject.
It was Abuelito's.
Don't think it's seen the road in about 20 years though.
Dad promised we'd fix it...together.
It's up to me now.
You did all this?
All it needed was a little upgrade.
Little upgrade?
It's what he would have wanted.
Come here,mijo.
What is it?
Uncle Carlos?
I need to get to school.
Uncle Carlos?
We're gonna need bulletproof glass... and Kevlar, lots of Kevlar.
[humming]
Gotta try this spicy tuna.
Do I know you?
No, Taylor, but you do know a friend of ours.
What friend is that?
Molly Walker.
You're gonna help us break her out.
Yeah, you are.
What do you know about your mother's research division?
What do you think you're doing?
What kind of security does she have?
Noah Bennet.
The original bag and tagger.
Careful, Taylor.
What kind of mother puts her own daughter into this line of work?
One who trusts me to get the job done.
Or maybe one who doesn't care if you take a bullet.
You know, I almost met your mom once.
June 13th.
Right after the bombing.
All I wanted was one minute so I could ask her face-to-face what happened to my sister.
Security was too tight.
I couldn't get near her, but now, I can get all my answers.
What do you think you'll find out?
She's kidnapping innocent people.
You have no idea what she's trying to accomplish.
And you do?
What is it you think she's trying to accomplish, Taylor?
Locking up human beings?
Torturing them?
- You don't know that.
- But they are human beings,
Taylor.
You must have seen that.
Believe me, all parents will lie to their kids to protect them from the truth.
I am not asking you to betray your mother.
I'm just asking you to question her.
[eerie humming]
What happened to Francis?
You know, every time I doubt the path I'm on,
I think about you, Taylor.
Mom, can we not drudge up the past for once?
Look, I'm not mad at you for sleeping around.
What upsets me is you would sleep with one of them.
You act like this is just some fling.
- With an Evo.
- With a great guy who I care about a lot.
When did you become such a bigot?
You have no idea what I am or what I'm trying to accomplish here.
Then tell me, Mom.
Bring me in for once.
Why are we rounding these people up?
Did you know that aluminum used to be one of the rarest, most valuable metals in the world?
I asked you a simple question.
In the courts of Napoleon III,
French royalty were served in round plates of solid gold while only the Emperor himself had the honor of eating on a plate of aluminum.
That's how hard it was to come by, and of course a few decades later, a chemist by the name of Charles Martin Hall developed a way to extract aluminum from common dirt at almost no cost, and just like that,
it went from the banquet halls of royalty to the pantries of peasants, all because of one person's creative spark.
This isn't a TED talk, Mom.
Just tell me the truth.
What are you really after?
Abundance, Taylor.
A world of infinite supply so that you never have to suffer through war, hunger, pollution, terrorism, greed.
I mean, all the horrible consequences of an overcrowded, selfish, doomed planet.
But you still haven't answered my question.
Why are we rounding up Evos?
To save our species.
Do you trust me?
Dr. Susan Morris to ICU.
Dr. Susan Morris to ICU.
Tommy!
I'm so glad you're okay.
Dude.
Uh, what are you guys doing here?
A friend gets t-boned by a drunk driver, we're not gonna sit at home with our thumbs up our--
- He gets the point, Brad.
We were worried about you.
Oh.
Wow.
Thomas Clark?
Is my mom okay?
She suffered what we call a blunt splenic trauma causing an internal hemorrhage.
But now she's fine, right?
She's stable, but we're still gonna have to do a blood transfusion.
Okay, great.
Let's do it.
- What's wrong?
- We don't have any O-negative blood on supply.
It's quite rare, and ever since the Evos came out, blood donations aren't what they used to be.
What about mine?
You can give her mine, right?
Well, blood relatives are more likely to be a match, but--
- Then test it.
Tommy.
She's the only family I have.
[chuckles] I almost forgot what it feels like to sweat.
Isn't it weirdly refreshing?
The Sindhis of Pakistan do not sweat.
We glow so that God may see us better.
Of course you do.
Why are we stopping?
The signs were there just like she said they'd be.
We don't have time to just stop.
Time?
What do you know about time?
I'm not a child anymore, Farah.
Have you ever wondered why we kept you hidden in the Arctic?
They've been hunting you, Malina.
Ever since your first birthday, our enemies have been searching for you with only one thing in mind-- death, which is why we must fight them back with life.
[speaking in Urdu] _
Calm down.
Calm down, sir.
We pose you no threat.
I need help out here now!
Yeah, there are these two--
- Training is over.
What's the matter with you?
It's gorgeous out.
I've been fighting this wicked headache the last couple days, so-- no, no, it just--it just-- it feels better in the dark.
Take a bloody aspirin.
No, I'll be fine.
Look, babe, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and...
I think maybe I should sit out this next appointment.
Maybe you should too.
Maybe we both should.
We could--I don't know, we could rent a boat and watch the sunset, and maybe open a bottle of wine, be normal like we used to be.
Normal?
It's not too late.
Oh.
Feels like the surface of the sun.
Yeah, like I said, my head--
- No wonder you're not yourself.
Here.
Get some rest, drink plenty of fluids, and I will pick you up some meds on the way back.
We used to be a part of something special, weren't we?
Things always look better in the rear view.
No, we were happy.
I know we were.
Things change, Luke.
You gotta keep changing with them.
Joanne.
What?
I still love you.
[eerie music]
[eerie humming]
[labored breathing]
It's beautiful, isn't it, when nature's so unpredictable?
Do they have any idea what's really coming?
I hope not, for their sake.
But I'm just one person.
What if I can't save them all by myself?
You're not alone, Malina.
You'll have help, even if the others don't know it yet.

What did you do to the suit?
Meet version 2.0.
You might want to stand back.
[hydraulic gears working]
So you made yourself a fancy costume.
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Yeah, a little.
Become a man who's fit to wear it, then I'll be impressed.
I'm not doing this for you, Father... or for Oscar.
Then why don the mask?
'Cause for once, I want to believe in something bigger than me.
Captain Dearing will be looking for you.
I have a feeling he might be onto me as well.
I will just have to get to him first.
Mom, don't get mad, but...
I had my blood tested to see if we were a match.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I risk exposing who I am?
But I had no choice.
[door opening]
The test results came back.
And?
You weren't a match.
How could I not be?
It's never a sure thing, even amongst family members.
So what do we do?
Well, the closest blood bank with her type is in South Bend, Indiana.
I can put in an order, but it could take up to six hours.
Tommy, is there something you want to tell me?
About what?
What happened in there?
She still needs blood.
Tommy, where are you going?
Indiana.
Want to come?
Sorry, cleared employees only.
But you do know who I am?
Yes, Ms. Kravid.
Good, then you should've seen this coming.
[both groan]
Now let's find Molly.
[beeping] [door opening]
We're close.
Molly's in here somewhere.
We don't want to shoot you, but we will if necessary.
"We"?
That's the guy that took my sister, or at least one of them is.
Hit the ground on the count of three.
- Wait, what?
- One...
What if they know where she is?
- Two...
- I hate your face, Bennet.
Three.
How are we not pausing to have a conversation about this?
You just saw that, right?
Right?
Three dudes just kind of crumbled into piles of kosher salt?
Welcome to my world.
I'm telling you, this list of Evos has been a godsend.
Remember the first one we killed?
Of course.
Afterward, you were so content.
You were so blissfully satisfied.
I have...never seen anyone sleep so soundly.
I spent the rest of that night hunched over a toilet.
Why are you saying this now?
We lost our son, Joanne, and for the last year, I've been so terrified that I would lose you too, and the truth is I have lost you.
I have lost myself.
We have lost each other.
What the hell?
[tires screeching]
If you want to do it, do it.
[breathing unsteadily]
I really did love you.
[car alert beeping]
[eerie humming]
[PA system chatter]
You ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary?
[laughs]
I work at an ice cream parlor in Carbondale, Illinois.
An extraordinary ice cream parlor.
[laughs]
Look, the thing is, Emily, I-I do get that feeling, all the time, and it sucks.
There's, like, 1,000 pounds of pressure weighing me down, reminding me that I'm different.
Good.
Good?
You are different, Tommy.
You'll always be different, but trust me, the moment you accept that, you're gonna start having way more fun.
Now...
let's go save your mom.
Oh, my gosh.
We totally just--
I am so never flying commercial again.
We have the blood!
- You have to run!
- What?
Your blood test went straight to a federal database.
They know what you are.
I'll take care of your mom, but you have to run.
Now!
Let's go.
You know what you have to do.
There are people watching.
Tommy, don't worry about them for once.
Just be you.
Be extraordinary.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Clark, not if you want your mother to get that blood you were so kind to deliver.
Uncle Carlos.
I was thinking we could add some performance cylinder heads.
[engine starts]
You did it!
It sounds great.
Hey, can I come with you?
Ah, too dangerous.
I want to push it up to 100.
Nothing's gonna happen.
I'll be fine.
I know,mijo,but...
I need you here holding down the fort.

Phoebe?
Phoebe?
- Are these all--
- Evos.
They were smart enough not to go to Odessa on June 13th, but they still couldn't hide from your mother.
Oh, my God, Francis.
What did she do to him?
Plotting bitch.
I once knew a man...
who could harvest people's powers through their brains.
He collected them, used them for his own ends, but I think your mother has found another way.
Noah?
Noah.
Molly.
Molly.
You're gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be all right.
There's no stopping it.
Every machine has an off switch.
Not this one.
I swear I didn't know what she was doing.
I'm so sorry.
What?
What is it?
You should've never found me.
Molly.
I'm just here to help.
People have been telling me that my entire life, but all they want to do is use me for my powers.
You should understand that better than anyone.
I'm not proud of my past.
You know if I could change it--
- Forget about the past, Noah.
This is about so much more than you and me and June 13th.
I was there in the hospital when your daughter died.
What happened?
We all knew what was at stake, and we agreed to do whatever was necessary to keep them safe.
- No--no!
- What are you doing?
Erica tried to take everything from me, but I was strong.
[crying] I was really strong, and I didn't give her the location.
Of what?
If I tell you, you won't go back, and then we're all dead anyway.
You're not making any sense.
I can't stop Erica, but I will not help her kill 7 billion people.
What?
Molly, put the gun down, and let's talk, okay?
You're the only one who can tell me what really happened on June 13th.
Forget the past, Noah.
Save the future.
Molly, just-- [gunshot]
[sobbing]
[alarm blaring]
We can't leave her like this.
If we don't, we're gonna end up just like her.
Come on, man.
We got to go.
Find them.
They can't be far.
We just lost Molly Walker, gunshot wound, self-inflicted.
How exactly did she manage to get her hands on a gun?
Security ID'd Noah Bennet, and... well, there's no way to put this delicately.
He was with your daughter.
Bring them to me.
What about EPIC?
Local tracking still functions properly.
As long as you're within 100 feet of an Evo, they'll all register on the device.
But remote locations?
Not without the girl.
At least tell me we found it before she died.
[scoffs]
Lovely.
It's only the future of the entire human race hanging in the balance.
Before global tracking went down, EPIC did pick up a signal in Canada that showed some potential.
It's too late for potential, Mr. Harris.
I need you to find me that child, and when you do, I need you to kill it.
I'll put my usual team on it.
No.
This is too important.
This time, you're taking the Shadow.
We all havea unique purpose, and try as we might, we cannot run from it.
Will we be able to stay true to who we are, or will we succumb to the pressure of destiny and become something else entirely?
Something inhuman?
-Previouslyon "HeroesReborn"...

Look, babe, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and...
I think maybe I should sit out this next appointment.
Maybe you should too.
Maybe we both should.
We could--I don't know, we could rent a boat and watch the sunset, and maybe open a bottle of wine, be normal like we used to be.
- Normal?
- It's not too late.
- Oh.
Feels like the surface of the sun.
- Yeah, like I said, my head--
- No wonder you're not yourself.
Here.
Get some rest, drink plenty of fluids, and I will pick you up some meds on the way back.
- We used to be a part of something special, weren't we?
- Things always look better in the rear view.
- No, we were happy.
I know we were.
- Things change, Luke.
You gotta keep changing with them.
- Joanne.
- What?
- I still love you.
[eeriemusic]
[eeriehumming]
[labored breathing]
- It's beautiful, isn't it, when nature's so unpredictable?
- Do they have any idea what's really coming?
- I hope not, for their sake.
- But I'm just one person.
What if I can't save them all by myself?
- You're not alone, Malina.
You'llhavehelp, eveniftheothers don'tknowit yet.
[indistinctPAannouncements]
[both speaking Japanese]
[footstepsapproaching]
- What did you do to the suit?
- Meet version 2.0.
You might want to stand back.
[hydraulic gears working]
- So you made yourself a fancy costume.
Am I supposed to be impressed?
- Yeah, a little.
- Become a man who's fit to wear it, then I'll be impressed.
- I'm not doing this for you, Father... or for Oscar.
- Then why don the mask?
- 'Cause for once, I want to believe in something bigger than me.
- Captain Dearing will be looking for you.
I have a feeling he might be onto me as well.
- Then we'll just have to get to him first.
- Mom, don't get mad, but...
I had my blood tested to see if we were a match.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I risk exposing who I am?
But I had no choice.
[dooropening]
- The test results came back.
- And?
- You weren't a match.
- How could I not be?
- It's never a sure thing, even amongst family members.
- So what do we do?
- Well, the closest blood bank with her type is in South Bend, Indiana.
I can put in an order, but it could take up to six hours.
Tommy, is there something you want to tell me?
- About what?
- What happened in there?
- She still needs blood.
- Tommy, where are you going?
- Indiana.
Want to come?
- Sorry, cleared employees only.
- But you do know who I am?
- Yes, Ms. Kravid.
- Good, then you should've seen this coming.
[both groan]
Now let's find Molly.
[beeping] [dooropening]
- We're close.
Molly's in here somewhere.
- We don't want to shoot you, but we will if necessary.
- "We"?
- That's the guy that took my sister, or at least one of them is.
- Hit the ground on the count of three.
- Wait, what?
- One...
- What if they know where she is?
- Two...
- I hate your face, Bennet.
- Three.
- How are we not pausing to have a conversation about this?
You just saw that, right?
Right?
Three dudes just kind of crumbled into piles of kosher salt?
- Welcome to my world.
- I'm telling you, this list of Evos has been a godsend.
- Remember the first one we killed?
- Of course.
- Afterward, you were so content.
You were so blissfully satisfied.
I have...never seen anyone sleep so soundly.
I spent the rest of that night hunched over a toilet.
- Why are you saying this now?
- We lost our son, Joanne, and for the last year, I've been so terrified that I would lose you too, and the truth is I have lost you.
I have lost myself.
We have lost each other.
- What the hell?
[tires screeching]
- If you want to do it, do it.
- [breathing unsteadily]
- I really did love you.
[caralertbeeping]
[eerie humming]
[PAsystemchatter]
- You ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary?
- [laughs]
I work at an ice cream parlor in Carbondale, Illinois.
- An extraordinary ice cream parlor.
- [laughs]
- Look, the thing is, Emily, I-I do get that feeling, all the time, and it sucks.
There's, like, 1,000 pounds of pressure weighing me down, reminding me that I'm different.
- Good.
- Good?
- You are different, Tommy.
You'll always be different, but trust me, the moment you accept that, you're gonna start having way more fun.
Now...
let's go save your mom.
[beep]
Oh, my gosh.
We totally just--
I am so never flying commercial again.
- We have the blood.
- You have to run.
- What?
- Your blood test went straight to a federal database.
They know what you are.
I'll take care of your mom, but you have to run.
Now!
- Let's go.
- You know what you have to do.
- There are people watching.
- Tommy, don't worry about them for once.
Just be you.
Be extraordinary.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Clark, not if you want your mother to get that blood you were so kind to deliver.
- Uncle Carlos.
I was thinking we could add some performance cylinder heads.
[enginestarts]
You did it!
It sounds great.
Hey, can I come with you?
- Ah, too dangerous.
I want to push it up to 100.
- Nothing's gonna happen.
I'll be fine.
- I know, mijo, but...
I need you here holding down the fort.
[tiresscreeching andenginerevving] [metalpartricochets]
- You're not going to believe this.
My dad, El Vengador.
- Just slow down.
- I used to be so afraid to show him what I could do, but this whole time, we could've been a team.
- Jose!
[speaking Spanish]
- Well, look what we got here.
Two-for-one special.
- Run, Jose.
- But--
- Now go!
Find your uncle!
[cries out]
-Dearing, Igotthekid .
- Holy sh--
[both speaking Japanese]
[peopleyelling]
- There she is.
- It's Katana Girl!
[all screaming]
- Phoebe?
Phoebe?
- Are these all--
- Evos.
They were smart enough not to go to Odessa on June 13th, but they still couldn't hide from your mother.
- Oh, my God, Francis.
What did she do to him?
Plotting bitch.
- I once knew a man..
who could harvest people's powers through their brains.
He collected them, used them for his own ends, but I think your mother has found another way.
- Noah?
Noah.
- Molly.
Molly.
You're gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be all right.
- There's no stopping it.
- Every machine has an off switch.
- Not this one.
- I swear I didn't know what she was doing.
I'm so sorry.
- What?
What is it?
- You should've never found me.
- Molly.
I'm just here to help.
- People have been telling me that my entire life, but all they want to do is use me for my powers.
You should understand that better than anyone.
- I'm not proud of my past.
You know if I could change it--
- Forget about the past, Noah.
This is about so much more than you and me and June 13th.
I was there in the hospital when your daughter died.
- What happened?
- We all knew what was at stake, and we agreed to do whatever was necessary to keep them safe.
- No--no!
- What are you doing?
- Erica tried to take everything from me, but I was strong.
[crying] I was really strong, and I didn't give her the location.
- Of what?
- If I tell you, you won't go back, and then we're all dead anyway.
- You're not making any sense.
- I can't stop Erica, but I will not help her kill 7 billion people.
- What?
- Molly, put the gun down, and let's talk, okay?
You're the only one who can tell me what really happened on June 13th.
- Forget the past, Noah.
Save the future.
- Molly, just-- [gunshot]
- [sobbing]
[alarmblaring]
- We can't leave her like this.
- If we don't, we're gonna end up just like her.
Come on, man.
We got to go.
- Find them.
They can't be far.
We just lost Molly Walker, gunshot wound, self-inflicted.
- How exactly did she manage to get her hands on a gun?
- Security ID'd Noah Bennet, and... well, there's no way to put this delicately.
He was with your daughter.
- Bring them to me.
What about EPIC?
- Local tracking still functions properly.
As long as you're within 100 feet of an Evo, they'll all register on the device.
- But remote locations?
- Not without the girl.
- At least tell me we found it before she died.
[scoffs]
Lovely.
It's only the future of the entire human race hanging in the balance.
- Before global tracking went down, EPIC did pick up a signal in Canada that showed some potential.
- It's too late for potential, Mr. Harris.
I need you to find me that child, and when you do, I need you to kill it.
- I'll put my usual team on it.
- No.
This is too important.
This time, you're taking the Shadow.

Our losses, our achievements, and our suffering.

Whoo-hoo!
My God, that was a pretty shot.
Did you see how his body crumpled before his eyes even realized he was dead?
Luke, I asked you a question.
Yeah, honey, that was a really pretty shot.
But this man, he had a family.
This man was a monster.
With a wife and a kid.
Who are safer now that we acted.
Or maybe we're just making assumptions because his name was on some list.
We don't know anything about these people.
He could've been a teacher, a doctor, I mean... (CLATTERS)

QUENTIN:
Look at these people.
They're digital sheep pedaling their free bikes, eating their precious free sushi, completely blind to everything that's going on around them.
You worked here for almost a year before you said anything.
It's really good sushi.
All right, come on.
We got to find a way inside the research lab.
Easier said than done.
Who said anything about easy?
You saw what they did with that device.
With EPIC online, no one is safe.
If they're really sucking out Molly's power, they're probably doing the same thing to Phoebe, turning her into some kind of...
Like, a shadow blaster or something.
What?
It's a thing.
It could be a thing.
Okay.
All right, all right.
You don't know.
Look, just keep your head low, and do exactly as I say, all right?
If your sister's here, we'll find her.
(BOLT CRANKING)
CARLOS:
What you doing?
(WRENCH CLATTERING) Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
What happened to your face?
Fell down some stairs.
(SIGHS)
Don't change the subject.
It was Abolition's.
Don't think it's seen the road in about 20 years though.
Dad promised we'd fix it.
Together.
It's up to me now.
You did all this?
All it needed was a little upgrade.
Little upgrade?
It's what he would have wanted.
Come here, Miro.
What is it?
Uncle Carlos?
I need to get to school.
Uncle Carlos?
We're gonna need bulletproof glass.
And Kevlar, lots of Kevlar.
(HUMMING)
Gotta try this spicy tuna.
Do I know you?
No, Taylor, but you do know a friend of ours.
What friend is that?
Molly Walker.
You're gonna help us break her out.
Yeah, you are.
NOAH:
What do you know about your mother's research division?
What do you think you're doing?
What kind of security does she have?
Noah Bennet.
The original bag and tagger.
Careful, Taylor.
What kind of mother puts her own daughter in this line of work?
One who trusts me to get the job done.
Or maybe one who doesn't care if you take a bullet?
QUENTIN:
You know, I almost met your mom once.
June 13th.
Right after the bombing.
All I wanted was one minute so I could ask her, face-to-face, what happened to my sister.
Security was too tight.
I couldn't get near her.
But now, I can get all my answers.
What do you think you'll find out?
She's kidnapping innocent people.
You have no idea what she's trying to accomplish.
NOAH:
And you do?
What is it you think she's trying to accomplish, Taylor?
Locking up human beings?
Torturing them?
You don't know that.
But they are human beings, Taylor.
You must have seen that.
Believe me, all parents will lie to their kids
to protect them from the truth.
I'm not asking you to betray your mother.
I'm just asking you to question her.
TAYLOR:
What happened to Francis?
You know, every time I doubt the path I'm on,
I think about you, Taylor.
Mom, can we not dredge up the past for once?
Look, I'm not mad at you for sleeping around.
What upsets me is you would sleep with one of them.
You act like this is just some fling.
With an Evo.
With a great guy, who I care about a lot.
(SIGHS) When did you become such a bigot?
You have no idea what I am, or what I'm trying to accomplish here.
Then tell me, Mom.
Bring me in for once.
Why are we rounding these people up?
Did you know that aluminum used to be one of the rarest, most valuable metals in the world?
I asked you a simple question.
In the courts of Napoleon Ill,
French royalty were served in round plates of solid gold, while only the Emperor himself had the honor of eating on a plate of aluminum.
That's how hard it was to come by.
And of course, a few decades later, a chemist by the name of Charles Martin Hall developed a way to extract aluminum from common dirt at almost no cost.
And just like that, it went from the banquet halls of royalty to the pantries of peasants.
All because of one person's creative spark.
This isn't a TED talk, Mom.
Just tell me the truth.
What are you really after?
Abundance, Taylor.
A world of infinite supply, so that you never have to suffer through war, hunger, pollution, terrorism, greed.
I mean, all the horrible consequences of an overcrowded, selfish, doomed planet.
But you still haven't answered my question.
Why are we rounding up Evos?
To save our species.
Do you trust me?
WOMAN: (ON PA) Dr. Susan Morris to ICU.
Dr. Susan Morris to ICU.
Tommy!
I'm so glad you're okay.
BRAD:
Dude.
Uh, what are you guys doing here?
A friend gets t-boned by a drunk driver, we're not gonna sit at home with our thumbs up our...
He gets the point, Brad.
We were worried about you.
Oh.
Wow.
DR. LOPEZ:
Thomas Clark?
Is my mom okay?
She suffered what we call a blunt splenic trauma causing an internal hemorrhage.
But now she's fine, right?
She's stable, but we're still gonna have to do a blood transfusion.
Okay, great.
Let's do it.
What's wrong?
We don't have any O-negative blood on supply.
It's quite rare, and ever since the Evos came out, blood donations aren't what they used to be.
What about mine?
You can give her mine, right?
Well, blood relatives are more likely to be a match...
Then test it.
EMILY:
Tommy.
She's the only family I have.
(CHUCKLES)
I almost forgot what it feels like to sweat.
Isn't it weirdly refreshing?
The Sindhis of Pakistan do not sweat.
We glow so that God may see us better.
Of course you do.
Why are we stopping?
The signs were there just like she said they'd be.
We don't have time to just stop.
Time?
What do you know about time?
I'm not a child anymore, Farah.
Have you ever wondered why we kept you hidden in the Arctic?
They've been hunting you, Malina.
Ever since your first birthday, our enemies have been searching for you with only one thing in mind.
Death.
Which is why we must fight them back with life.
(SPEAKING URDU)
Calm down.
Calm down, sir.
We pose you no threat.
(CELLPHONE BEEPS)
I need help out here now!
Yeah, there are these two... (GRUNTS)
Training is over.
What's the matter with you?
It's gorgeous out.
I've been fighting this wicked headache the last couple days, so...
No, no, it just, it just...
It feels better in the dark.
Take a bloody aspirin.
No, I'll be fine.
Look, babe, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and, uh...
I think maybe I should sit out this next appointment.
Maybe you should, too.
Maybe we both should.
We could...
I don't know.
We could...
We could rent a boat and watch the sunset, and maybe open a bottle of wine, be normal like we used to be.
Normal?
It's not too late.
Oh.
Feels like the surface of the sun.
Yeah, like I said, I...
No wonder you're not yourself.

Get some rest, drink plenty of fluids, and I will pick you up some meds on the way back.
We used to be a part of something special, weren't we?
Things always look better in the rear view.
No, we were happy.
I know we were.
Things change, Luke.
You gotta keep changing with them.
Joanne.
What?
I still love you.

(LABORED BREATHING)
It's beautiful, isn't it?

How exactly did she manage to get her hands on a gun?
Security ID'd Noah Bennet, and...
Well, there's no way to put this delicately.
He was with your daughter.
Bring them to me.
What about EPIC?
Local tracking still functions properly.
As long as you're within 100 feet of an Evo, they'll all register on the device.
But remote locations?
Not without the girl.
At least tell me we found it before she died.
(SCOFFS)
Lovely.
It's only the future of the entire human race hanging in the balance.
Before global tracking went down,
EPIC did pick up a signal in Canada that showed some potential.
It's too late for potential, Mr. Harris.
I need you to find me that child.
And when you do, I need you to kill it.
I'll put my usual team on it.
No.
This is too important.
This time, you're taking the Shadow.
SURESH:
We all have a unique purpose, and try as we might, we cannot run from it.
The only question that remains, will we be able to stay true to who we are, or will we succumb to the pressure of destiny and become something else entirely?
Something inhuman?
Previousy on The Expanse...
Picked up a Mayday.
Looks like a light freighter.
Calls itself the Scopuli.
We're obligated to check it out.
- It's pirate bait.
- Purge the logs.
We never received that signal.
I have something for you.
Little lost daughter case.
So what's my contract exactly?
Find Julie Mao.
If she's still here on Ceres, detain her and ship her home.
Kidnap job.
My pleasure.
Anybody grew up this far from the sun won't give a good goddamn what planet you're from.
Real sky over your head and real gravity holding you on the ground, they don't trust you.
That distress call we never received, it was logged with HQ.
Holden, you'll head up this rescue, or salvage.
Put a shuttle team together.
So, just for the record, guys,
I don't wanna be here right now.
This must be the beacon that called us.
Forwarding you an A-1 tight beam from the Canterbury.
Torpedo launch!
Canterbury, burn like hell, you got incoming.
Real lemon works best, if you could ever get your hands on one.
It's a crucial part of the formula.
Neutralizes acidity, adds body, balances pH.
Something like that.
Here.
A perfect cup of coffee.
Ah!
- It's an acquired taste.
- Yeah.
- So, wait and see.
- Yeah.
Hey, what's your name?
Ade.
I'm the new navigator.
Jim, there's something you should know.
Hoss.
Hoss!
Debris field.
Buckle up!
I'll try to drive us out of it.
How bad are we gonna catch it?
Pretty bad.
Right, sweetheart.
You know how much I love you.
Airlock breach!
We're losing pressure!
Somebody close the hatch!
I'm on it!
Somebody shut that damn airlock!
Son of a bitch.
We're through.
Do we still have scopes?
Damn straight.
Do not lose that ship.
What?
- Jesus, you're not...
- We're going after them.
- Buddy, I don't think...
- We're losing them!
Don't do it, Alex.
They just dusted 50 of our friends.
Well, let's not make it 55.
Alex, I'm telling you to go after that ship.
What if they don't like being followed?
They slip off that screen, they're gone forever.
They'll get away with this.
What is wrong with you?
I gave an order!
You think rank matters now?
Get up, I'll do it myself.
Get up!
We're not going anywhere.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Whoa, whoa!
Let's just take a deep breath here, people.
All of you.
Water ration exceeded.
Water ration exceeded.
They're trying to thirst us out.
- Who's that?
- Earth, Mars.
The water shipment's not late, copain.
They're holdin' it back.
You seem pretty sure about that.
Water means life.
One shipment late, you got protests.
Two shipments late, you got dead people in the street.
And it's gonna get worse.
Mark my words.
Christ.
"Father, bother, poured hot coffee in the parking lot."
"Father, bother, poured hot coffee in the parking lot."
Home.
I'm home.
Show me my files.
Copy all files.
Replay my last messages.
I tried to give you the best of all worlds, and you choose to live like some filthy handmaid among the riff-raff of the Solar System.
Since you have no intention of returning home,
I'm forced to consider selling The Razorback.
You're naive, sweetheart.
It's time to come home.
Please.
I'll make everything right again.
Jesus.
Spare me.
Show me my replies.
You're so blind and so condescending and you're never gonna change.
If you won't take yourself seriously as an adult, then why should I care about being your child?
You want to sell The Razorback?
Do it.
You can't buy me off or control me anymore.
Maybe what you hate about me the most is that I remind you of yourself.
Keep it up, partner.
You'll get there.
_
Is it true that you had a Belter up on hooks for 20 hours?
He's an O.P.A. smuggler and a terrorist.
The Secretary-General...
He didn't want to talk...
The Secretary-General has publicly disavowed gravity torture.
If you want to talk to that Belter, you put him in the tank.
You know who I am?
I've heard of you, yes.
Many interesting tales.
You're well-spoken for an O.P.A. soldier.
Because I'm a Belter, I'm naturally O.P.A.?
I'm just a citizen of the Belt.
I work for the future of my people as you do for yours.
Then for the future of both our people,
I need to know how you got your hands on restricted stealth technology that could destroy the balance in the system.
You mean the balance between Earth and Mars.
Either way, it's a lousy deal for Belters.
The O.P.A. demands legitimacy through violence.
They haven't earned it any other way.
No?
You talk to me through a piece of glass, you see my body which can no longer survive on the very planet that bore my great-grandmother.
Earth has created a race of exiles out in space, who have no homes to return to.
Should this go unanswered?
I don't mean to make you afraid, madame.
Have I given you the impression that I'm afraid?
Then why waste your time on a meaningless courier like myself?
You're too modest, child.
Someone entrusted you to transport pieces of the holy grail.
The question is, who?
There are places far worse than this.
And I imagine there is a mother somewhere who'll love to see her boy again.
Est cela ça, madame.
I understand.
We all have our duty.
_
We've got a dead radio and about four hours of oxygen left.
Alex, how much burn do we have?
I could get us maybe a third of the way to Ganymede Station, maybe.
Or get us right to the edge of the shipping lanes, and then we'd have to pray someone tripped over us.
It won't happen.
With a dead transponder, we're just like space trash.
What's wrong with the radio?
Board's cooked, and I'm guessing the antenna array up top has seen better days.
See if you can improvise another board.
I'm gonna go outside and see what's what.
Great.
We'll wait here.
I don't mean to be a bad news bull or anything, but the airlock's done.
The outer door's gone.
Then we'll have to vent the ship.
Are you outta your tree?
We'll lose all oxygen in the cabin.
Everything depends on fixing that radio.
We're wasting time.
There you go.
Calling the shots again.
I'm going outside.
You got a problem with that?
Amos, go with him.
Whoa!
Let's just hold on for one second.
We don't have to go outside.
We're safe right now.
We open those doors, we're done.
The ship could crack apart.
I'm telling you...
- Shed?
- I'm just...
If we open those doors...
Please, just listen to me.
Listen to me!
If we out there, we're gonna die.
Hey, hey, hey!
You're in shock.
You're in shock.
You know the symptoms.
You know the symptoms.
Just breathe.
Breathe.
Deep... breathe.
Breathe, breathe.
All right.
There.
There.
You chilled?
Okay.
Now, we're gonna go outside, and we're gonna fix the antenna, and we're gonna make some noise and get rescued.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
Watch your step, boys.
We're on the way.
How's it looking out there?
Well, it could've been worse.
It can always be worse.
Okay.
It's worse.
Captain was pissed you weren't around.
She wanted this dealt with.
Yeah, it must be my week.
New Earth partner.
Drawing all the "hot" cases...
Your attention, please.
The Air, Water and Power...
Well, it's about time.
Expected you an hour ago.
It's a long hoof from the Medina, sir.
A week ago, those dead patches started appearing.
My guess is, the Greigas are stealing water again.
Some Belters clearly don't respect the green space's role in recycling the air and the water.
Not to mention the embarrassment it causes the Governor.
You seem sure it was Belters.
The criminals here tend to be.
You're new here, aren't you?
We'll get right on that, sir.
Maybe if everyone in Ceres had this view, they'd respect you more.
There.
Now, you can make your own view.
Oh, shit!
You're an Earther.
And I don't even know where you're from.
We're gonna be space trash in a few hours and you wanna start a friendship?
If you don't think we're gonna make it, what are you doing up here?
Naomi told me to, so I am.
As far as I'm concerned, she's the cap now.
♪ Till I lost my Clementine ♪
Alex, send me some juice to E-12.
- ♪ How I missed her... ♪
- Alex?
Alex!
Oh.
E-12.
Copy that.
There you go, sugar.
You doin' okay up there?
I'm doing as good as dew on a mornin' full of sunshine.
Hey, what's the deal with you and Naomi?
You two an item or something?
An item?
Hey, it's none of my business, but...
You must think I'm pretty stupid, don't you?
I mean, you're right.
I can take a core apart and put it back together with my eyes closed.
But ask me whether or not I should rip your helmet off and kick you off this bucket, and I couldn't give you a reason why I should or shouldn't.
Except Naomi wouldn't like it.
Could you pass me the drill?
Thank you.
♪ Then I lost my Clementine ♪
Alex, what are you doing?
I'm bringin' her home, honey-pie.
- Hey.
- One more, two... and we'll be together.
Just one trip to Ganymede, sweetheart.
Oh, don't be like that, sugar, I said I'm comin' home.
- Alex.
- Shed, what's wrong with him?
He's, uh... he's hypoxic.
Oh, shit!
His breather's crapping out!
Damn it!
How long can he hold on?
Oh, oh, shit.
We're losin' him!
We're coming back in.
Negative.
We don't have enough oxygen to vent again.
Shed, take care of him!
Do something!
We're in a vacuum!
He's in a suit!
I...
What do you want me to do?
There's no spare!
Shed, you're a medic!
Act like one!
Hold on, buddy.
Listen, I'm hooking our breathers up, okay?
So we can share air.
So you can breathe off mine, okay?
Shed, what's happening?
Okay.
Hold on, buddy.
Come on.
Hold on, Alex!
Come on.
Yeah, there it is!
Breathe!
Breathe, Alex!
Breathe it in.
Breathe.
Just keep breathing.
We're buddy-breathing.
It's all gonna be good.
It's all good.
Shed, you got this?
No one else dies today.
If we don't get that radio back, we all die... today.
Okay, Alex.
My turn, buddy.
I just need a couple of breaths.
Ah, that's the stuff.
How's Alex doing?
He's hanging in there.
What does that mean?
Means he's hanging in there!
Get on with it.
Hurry up.
Don't look at it.
Just think about something else, okay?
Like your kid.
Think about your kid.
Swinging on a...
Swinging on a swing or something.
You're trying to distract me.
Hey, guys.
We're running out of...
we're running out of air.
Now?
No carrier.
Ah, piece of shit!
We have connection.
Get back in here now!
Come on.
- Go!
- Pressurizing.
Ow!
What the hell did you do to me?
You saved my hide, partner.
You crazy son of a bitch.
Ah, no problem.
I need him sent to Luna for deeper interrogations.
Let the team here go another round, they'll break him.
They have a budget, it's already shot to hell.
And unlike you, I have to grovel and promise and deliver to get reappointed.
This concerns me?
How?
You're two heartbeats away from running the government on this planet.
Yet you're accountable to no one.
How does that happen?
This boy isn't some hapless smuggler.
I believe the O.P.A may be trying to obtain stealth weapons.
Everything is not an O.P.A. plot and if Earth can't afford a stealth program, how can a bunch of rock-tossers?
They can't...
Unless they've found a new friend like Mars.
Cold war is a bloodless war.
Mutual distrust and complete co-dependence.
Nobody wants to change that.
Least of all Mars.
That's another thing.
I want every Martian weapons facility under a microscope.
They are.
You know, your Belter will like gravity on Luna better.
That's the only thing he'll like.
I'm afraid for him.
Heaven help your enemies, Chrisjen.
Heaven help us all if Mars and the Belt decide to share a toothbrush.
Bold move, I'll give him that.
What?
The cold war is over, this is something new.
The antenna's working but our signal's still too weak.
The transmitter was severed from the power grid.
It's done.
This just keeps getting better and better.
So we just blew an hour of air for a radio that doesn't even work?
Can't we rig ourselves an amplifier?
We're gonna need a shit load of power.
Take everything apart.
Be fast and be careful, we're inside of a limb with a pin here.
If it has a battery, a power pack, any charge capability, it goes into a part.
I'm sorry, does anyone need a back rub first?
Last one.
Even if someone hears our SOS, they're gonna think we're pirates.
Well...
We're gonna just have to pray there's another caring soul out there like Ade.
Ade?
She's why we're in this shit right now.
If she hadn't gone and logged that stupid distress call...
Hey!
You don't know what you are talking about.
You wanna keep your teeth in your mouth...
We're wasting air.
Give me a hand over here, will you, buddy?
You want to unburden your soul, do it on your own time.
On the remotest chance we get off this alive.
We have enough problems right now.
Yes, sir.
You know that guy was telling you to go hump yourself.
- Yeah.
- Geez...
Really?
I hadn't realized that.
I've got plans for it, anyway.
Not even gonna ask.
Nice tat.
Your boss lets you wear your colors like that, out in the open?
Boss has one just like it.
Here's the one.
Feeds the south-east corner of the gardens.
- This guy?
- Yeah.
Look it, here.
Sensor box should be to your right.
Amateurs.
But you gotta admire their stones for hittin' the park.
Where did you say this pipe diverts to?
Twelfth Level, condenser grid.
It's in a warehouse.
Even water like this today,
Belter loader gonna want it.
Huh?
Hmm?
Sa baka.
It's good!
Good.
We can sell it.
Let's make some money!
Star Helix, don't move!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Be smart.
Come on, kid.
Huh?
Is that everything you got?
Hey...
Hey!
Doing my work, cop.
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you punks doing stealing up-tunnel water?
Free sample.
All piss and vinegar.
You know, you're lucky it's us chasing you and not the Greigas.
They would feed you your fingers, for playin' in their district.
Greigas gone.
This is our turf now.
Nobody just abandons their territory to a bunch of street punks.
You see, the Greigas were smart.
They'd siphon a little water, and sell it off...
Nobody's the wiser.
But you, you gutter punks.
You screwed the golden goose.
- Mmm?
- Okay, man.
Schoolin' me on gangsters, que?
Yeah, dirtbag school's in session.
Listen...
Pick all the pockets you want, roll drunks...
But when you mess with the water, that's when you're going down.
Maybe a couple of years on a prison barge will set him straight.
Huh?
Would you like that?
Do what you gotta do.
Hey...
Hey!
Get out of here.
Stay away from the aqua.
Tell all your friends!
I did not see that coming.
Yeah?
How about this?
You see that coming?
Yeah.
Madam, I apologize for calling so late.
There's been an incident on the shuttle to Luna.
Go on.
The prisoner, Heikki Sobong took his own life by avoiding the high-gravity injections from his crash couch...
It appears he broke free of his restraints, during the critical phase of the ascent, when he knew the guards would be receiving their own injections.
I think, madam, he is making a statement.
Speak frankly, please.
Earth's gravity.
We used it to hurt him.
He threw it back in our face.
You want to clue us in?
This beacon we answered isn't pirate tech...
It's top-grade military stuff.
Serial stamp on the main board.
Martian Congressional Navy.
That makes no kind of sense.
It makes all kinds of sense.
That ship that attacked The Cant wasn't tucked behind an asteroid, it was hiding in plain sight.
A stealth ship... why would they nuke a civilian ship without warning?
Because they can.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Whoa...
What the hell are we tangled up in here?
Who gives a shit?
Let's focus on staying alive.
We'll worry about Mars later.
Good so far?
Good signal.
We've got three hours of juice.
Well...
I guess all we gotta do now is pop a cold beer, and wait to be rescued.
Nope.
Got no record of a Razorback on these docks.
Any, um, special hangar where rich people keep their pleasure-craft?
On Ceres?
Not last I heard.
Now, there's a girl I'm not gonna forget anytime soon.
Yeah, why's that?
Uh, few rotations back, some dock-jock was slobbering all over her while she was prepping to ship out.
Eh, guy must've mistaken her good manners for encouragement and when he laid hands on her, god damn, she planted him in the deck.
That girl had skills.
What ship was that?
Scopuli.
Dumpy old transport.
No cargo, just this young lady and a few crew.
Send me the ship manifest, will you?
And transponder logs, et cetera?
She in some kind of trouble?
I'm sure it's nothin' she can't handle.
Alex?
Someone heard us.
- Someone heard us?
- Yeah.
Are they coming?
Just waiting for the bounce back.
What is that?
Ship en route.
How far?
It's almost 80,000 clicks.
It's gonna be a hell of a close shave.
We'll make it.
What?
What is it?
The ship.
It's Mars.
What?
The Donnager.
The flagship of the Martian Navy.
Coming to finish the job.
And we just told 'em where we were.
... continues to appear for the raider Canterbury which disappeared while responding to a distress call.
The Canterbury was reported to be carrying ice, bound for Ceres station.
And the loss of that shipment has prompted a drastic increase in water rationing station-wide.
A spokesperson...
- Hey.
- Hey.
Good golly, Ms. Mao.
You sure can pick 'em.
Find your lost heiress yet?
Well...
She's not on Ceres.
Shipped out on the Scopuli.
It just went dark right after take-off.
Vanished.
The week for vanishing ships.
You'd think a rich girl like her would've had that birthmark fixed.
I don't know.
If it was a birthmark, her parents would have had it fixed.
That's a scar.
I don't think she wanted it fixed.
Why do you say that?
Oh, it's a badge of defiance.
Against everything she's supposed to be.
Wow.
She tell you that herself?
Yeah, she did.
Listen, we're the only ones who know what happened to the Cant.
We get on that ship and chances are we're never comin' out.
Unless...
What are you doing?
Buying us insurance.
My name is James Holden, speaking for the five survivors of the Canterbury.
Our ship was destroyed answering a bogus SOS from a ship called the Scopuli.
We recovered a false beacon and identified it as Martian Naval technology.
- It was a trap.
- Are you insane?
We are about to be taken aboard the MCRN Donnager.
- Alex, shut him down!
- He's locked us out.
He's locked us out!
Hey, whoa, whoa!
You don't speak for us.
We intend to cooperate and hope this means we won't be harmed.
Should I smoke him?
Say the word.
We're dead anyway.
Any such action will only confirm that the Canterbury was destroyed by Mars.
It just needs to reach one ship, one station.
Then it'll spread.
Don't count on it.
Their jammers were in range.
You are prisoners of the Mars Congressional Republic.
Move and you die.

I don't mean to be a bad news bull or anything, but the airlock's done.
The outer door's gone.
Then we'll have to vent the ship.
Are you outta your tree?
We'll lose all oxygen in the cabin.
Everything depends on fixing that radio.
We're wasting time.
There you go.
Calling the shots again.
I'm going outside.
You got a problem with that?
Amos, go with him.
Whoa!
Let's just hold on for one second.
We don't have to go outside.
We're safe right now.
We open those doors, we're done.
The ship could crack apart.
I'm telling you...
Shed?
I'm just...
If we open those doors...
Please, just listen to me.
Listen to me!
If we out there, we're gonna die.
Hey, hey, hey!
You're in shock.
You're in shock.
You know the symptoms.
You know the symptoms.
Just breathe.
Breathe.
Deep... breathe.
Breathe, breathe.
All right.
There.
There.
You chilled?
Okay.
Now, we're gonna go outside, and we're gonna fix the antenna, and we're gonna make some noise and get rescued.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.

Yourattention,please.
Theair,waterand power...
Well, it's about time.
Expected you an hour ago.
It's a long hoof from the Medina, sir.
A week ago, those dead patches started appearing.
My guess is, the greigas are stealing water again.
Some belters clearly don't respect the green space's role in recycling the air and the water.
Not to mention the embarrassment it causes the governor.
You seem sure it was belters.
The criminals here tend to be.
You're new here, aren't you?
We'll get right on that, sir.
Maybe if everyone in ceres had this view, they'd respect you more.
There.
Now, you can make your own view.

Ow!
What the hell did you do to me?
You saved my hide, partner.
You crazy son of a bitch.
Ah, no problem.
I need him sent to Luna for deeper interrogations.
Let the team here go another round, they'll break him.
They have a budget, it's already shot to hell.
And unlike you, i have to grovel and promise and deliver to get reappointed.
This concerns me?
How?
You're two heartbeats away from running the government on this planet.
Yet you're accountable to no one.
How does that happen?
This boy isn't some hapless smuggler.
I believe the o.P.A may be trying to obtain stealth weapons.
Everything is not an o.P.A. Plot and if earth can't afford a stealth program, how can a bunch of rock-tossers?
They can't...
Unless they've found a new friend like Mars.
Cold war is a bloodless war.
Mutual distrust and complete co-dependence.
Nobody wants to change that.
Least of all Mars.
That's another thing.
I want every martian weapons facility under a microscope.
They are.
You know, your belter will like gravity on Luna better.
That's the only thing he'll like.
I'm afraid for him.
Heaven help your enemies, chrisjen.
Heaven help us all if Mars and the belt decide to share a toothbrush.
Bold move, I'll give him that.
What?
The cold war is over, this is something new.
The antenna's working but our signal's still too weak.
The transmitter was severed from the power grid.
It's done.
This just keeps getting better and better.
So we just blew an hour of air for a radio that doesn't even work?
Can't we rig ourselves an amplifier?
We're gonna need a shit load of power.
Take everything apart.
Be fast and be careful, we're inside of a limb with a pin here.
If it has a battery, a power pack, any charge capability, it goes into a part.
I'm sorry, does anyone need a back rub first?
Last one.
Even if someone hears our sos, they're gonna think we're pirates.
Well...
We're gonna just have to pray there's another caring soul out there like Ade.
Ade?
She's why we're in this shit right now.
If she hadn't gone and logged that stupid distress call...
Hey!
You don't know what you are talking about.
You wanna keep your teeth in your mouth...
We're wasting air.
Give me a hand over here, will you, buddy?
You want to unburden your soul, do it on your own time.
On the remotest chance we get off this alive.
We have enough problems right now.
Yes, sir.
You know that guy was telling you to go hump yourself.
Yeah.
Geez... really?
I hadn't realized that.
I've got plans for it, anyway.
Not even gonna ask.
Nice tat.
Your boss lets you wear your colors like that, out in the open?
Boss has one just like it.
Here's the one.
Feeds the south-east corner of the gardens.
This guy?
Yeah.
Look it, here.
Sensor box should be to your right.
Amateurs.
But you gotta admire their stones for hittin' the park.
Where did you say this pipe diverts to?
Twelfth level, condenser grid.
It's in a warehouse.
Even water like this today, belter loader gonna want it.
Huh?
Hmm?
Sabaka.
It's good!
Good.
We can sell it.
Let's make some money!
Star helix, don't move!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Be smart.
Come on, kid.
Huh?
Is that everything you got?
Hey... hey!
Doing my work, cop.
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you punks doing stealing up-tunnel water?
Free sample.
All piss and vinegar.
You know, you're lucky it's us chasing you and not the greigas.
They would feed you your fingers, for playin' in their district.
Greigas gone.
This is our turf now.
Nobody just abandons their territory to a bunch of street punks.
You see, the greigas were smart.
They'd siphon a little water, and sell it off...
Nobody's the wiser.
But you, you gutter punks.
You screwed the golden goose.
Mmm?
Okay, man.
Schoolin' me on gangsters, que?
Yeah, dirtbag school's in session.
Listen... pick all the pockets you want, roll drunks...
But when you mess with the water, that's when you're going down.
Maybe a couple of years on a prison barge will set him straight.
Huh?
Would you like that?
Do what you gotta do.
Hey... hey!
Get out of here.
Stay away from the aqua.
Tell all your friends!
I did not see that coming.
Yeah?
How about this?
You see that coming?
Yeah.
Madam, Iapologizefor callingsolate.

You want to clue us in?
This beacon we answered isn't pirate tech...
It's top-grade military stuff.
Serial stamp on the main board.
Martian congressional Navy.
That makes no kind of sense.
It makes all kinds of sense.
That ship that attacked thecantwasn'ttucked behind an asteroid, it was hiding in plain sight.
A stealth ship... why would they nuke a civilian ship without warning?
Because they can.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Whoa...
What the hell are we tangled up in here?
Who gives a shit?
Let's focus on staying alive.
We'll worry about Mars later.
Good so far?
Good signal.
We've got three hours of juice.
Well...
I guess all we gotta do now is pop a cold beer, and wait to be rescued.
Nope.
Got no record of a razorback on these docks.
Any, um, special hangar where rich people keep their pleasure-craft?
On ceres ?
Not last I heard.
Now, there's a girl I'm not gonna forget anytime soon.
Yeah, why's that?
Uh, few rotations back, some dock-jock was slobbering all over her while she was prepping to ship out.
Eh, guy must've mistaken her good manners for encouragement and when he laid hands on her, god damn, she planted him in the deck.
That girl had skills.
What ship was that?
Scopuli.
Dumpy old transport.
No cargo, just this young lady and a few crew.
Send me the ship manifest, will you?
And transponder logs, et cetera?
She in some kind of trouble?
I'm sure it's nothin' she can't handle.
Alex?
Someone heard us.
Someone heard us?
Yeah.
Are they coming?
Just waiting for the bounce back.
What is that?
Ship en route.
How far?
It's almost 80,000 clicks.
It's gonna be a hell of a close shave.
We'll make it.
What?
What is it?
The ship.
It's Mars.
What?
The donnager.
The flagship of the martian Navy.
Coming to finish the job.
And we just told 'em where we were.
...continuestoappearfor theraidercanterbury whichdisappearedwhile respondingtoadistresscall .
Thecanterburywas reportedtobe carryingice , b adrasticincreasein waterrationingstation-wide.
Aspokesperson...
Hey.
Hey.
Good golly, Ms. mao.
You sure can pick 'em.
Find your lost heiress yet?
Well...
She's not on ceres.
Shipped out on the scopuli.
It just went dark right after take-off.
Vanished.
The week for vanishing ships.
You'd think a rich girl like her would've had that birthmark fixed.
I don't know.
If it was a birthmark, her parents would have had it fixed.
That's a scar.
I don't think she wanted it fixed.
Why do you say that?
Oh, it's a badge of defiance.
Against everything she's supposed to be.
Wow.
She tell you that herself?
Yeah, she did.
Listen, we're the only ones who know what happened to the cant.
We get on that ship and chances are we're never comin' out.
Unless...
What are you doing?
Buying us insurance.
Mynameis JamesHolden, speakingforthefive survivorsofthecanterbury.
Our ship was destroyed answering a bogus sos from a ship called the scopuli.
We recovered a false beacon and identified it as martian naval technology.
It was a trap.
Are you insane?
We are about to be taken aboard the mcrn donnager.
Alex, shut him down!
He's locked us out.
He's locked us out!
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Youdon'tspeakfor us.
Weintendto cooperate andhopethismeans wewon'tbe harmed.
Should I smoke him?
Say the word.
We're dead anyway.
Any such action will only confirm that the canterbury was destroyed by Mars.
It just needs to reach one ship, one station.
Then it'll spread.
Don't count on it.
Their jammers were in range.
Youare prisonersoftheMars congressionalRepublic.
Moveandyoudie .
Picked up a Mayday.
Looks like a light freighter.
Calls itself the Scopuli.
We're obligated to check it out.
It's pirate bait.
Purge the logs.
We never received that signal.
I have something for you.
Little lost-daughter case.
So what's my contract exactly?
Find Julie Mao, if she's still here on Ceres, detain her, and ship her home.
Kidnap job.
My pleasure.
Anybody grew up this far from the sun won't give a good goddamn what planet you're from.
Real sky over your head and real gravity holding you on the ground, they don't trust you.
That distress call we never received, it was logged with HQ.
Holden, you'll head up this rescue, or salvage.
Put a shuttle team together.
So, just for the record, guys,
I don't wanna be here right now.
This must be the beacon that called us.
Forwarding you an A-1 tight beam from the Canterbury.
Torpedo launch!
Canterbury, burn like hell, you've got incoming!
Real lemon works best, if you could ever get your hands on one.
It's a crucial part of the formula.
Neutralizes acidity, adds body, balances pH.
Something like that.
Here.
A perfect cup of coffee.
Ah!
It's an acquired taste.
Yeah.
So, wait and see.
Yeah.
Hey, what's your name?
Ade.
I'm the new navigator.
Jim, there's something you should know.
Hoss.
Hoss!
Debris field.
Buckle up!
I'll try to drive us out of it.
How bad are we gonna catch it?
Pretty bad.
Right, sweetheart.
You know how much I love you.
Airlock breach!
We're losing pressure!
Somebody close the hatch!
I'm on it!
Somebody shut that damn airlock!
Son of a bitch.
We're through.
Do we still have scopes?
Damn straight.
Do not lose that ship.
What?
Jesus, you're not...
We're going after them.
Buddy, I don't think...
We're losing them!
Don't do it, Alex.
They just dusted 50 of our friends.
Well, let's not make it 55.
Alex, I'm telling you to go after that ship.
What if they don't like being followed?
They slip off that screen, they're gone forever.
They'll get away with this.
What is wrong with you?
I gave an order!
You think rank matters now?
Get up, I'll do it myself.
Get up!
We're not going anywhere.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Whoa, whoa!
Let's just take a deep breath here, people.
All of you.
Water ration exceeded.
Water ration exceeded.
They're trying to thirst us out.
Who's that?
BOUILLOTTE DEALER:
Earth, Mars.
The water shipment's not late, copeng.
They're holdin' it back.
You seem pretty sure about that.
Water means life.
One shipment late, you got protests.
Two shipments late, you got dead people in the street.
And it's gonna get worse.
Mark my words.
Christ.
"Father, bother,"
"poured hot coffee in the parking lot. "
"Father, bother, poured hot coffee in the parking lot. "
Home.
I'm home.
Show me my files.
Copy all files.
Replay my last messages.
I tried to give you the best of all worlds, and you choose to live like some filthy handmaid among the riff-raff of the Solar System.
Since you have no intention of returning home,
I'm forced to consider selling the Razorback.
You're naive, sweetheart.
It's time to come home.
Please.
I'll make everything right again.
Jesus.
Spare me.
Show me my replies.
You're so blind and so condescending and you're never gonna change.
If you won't take yourself seriously as an adult, then why should I care about being your child?
You want to sell the Razorback?
Do it.
You can't buy me off or control me any more.
Maybe what you hate about me the most is that I remind you of yourself.
Keep it up, partner.
You'll get there.
Is it true that you had a Belter up on hooks for 20 hours?
He's an O. P.A. smuggler and a terrorist.
The Secretary-General...
He didn't want to talk...
The Secretary-General has publicly disavowed gravity torture.
If you want to talk to that Belter, you put him in the tank.
You know who I am?
I've heard of you, yes.
Many interesting tales.
You're well-spoken for an O. P.A. soldier.
Because I'm a Belter, I'm naturally O.P.A.?
I'm just a citizen of the Belt.
I work for the future of my people as you do for yours.
Then for the future of both our people,
I need to know how you got your hands on restricted stealth technology that could destroy the balance in the system.
You mean the balance between Earth and Mars.
Either way, it's a lousy deal for Belters.
The O. P.A. demands legitimacy through violence.
They haven't earned it any other way.
No?
You talk to me through a piece of glass, you see my body which can no longer survive on the very planet that bore my great-grandmother.
Earth has created a race of exiles out in space, who have no homes to return to.
Should this go unanswered?
I don't mean to make you afraid, madam.
Have I given you the impression that I'm afraid?
Then why waste your time on a meaningless courier like myself?
You're too modest, child.
Someone entrusted you to transport pieces of the Holy Grail.
The question is, who?
There are places far worse than this.
And I imagine there is a mother somewhere who'll love to see her boy again.
Y sasa, madam.
I understand.
We all have our duty.
We've got a dead radio and about four hours of oxygen left.
Alex, how much burn do we have?
I could get us maybe a third of the way to Ganymede Station, maybe.
Or get us right to the edge of the shipping lanes, and then we'd have to pray someone tripped over us.
It won't happen.
With a dead transponder, we're just like space trash.
What's wrong with the radio?
Board's cooked, and I'm guessing the antenna array up top has seen better days.
See if you can improvise another board.
I'm gonna go outside and see what's what.
Great.
We'll wait here.
I don't mean to be a bad news bull or anything, but the airlock's done.
The outer door's gone.
Then we'll have to vent the ship.
Are you outta your tree?
We'll lose all oxygen in the cabin.
Everything depends on fixing that radio.
We're wasting time.
There you go.
Calling the shots again.
I'm going outside.
You got a problem with that?
Amos, go with him.
Whoa!
Let's just hold on for one second.
We don't have to go outside.
We're safe right now.
We open those doors, we're done.
The ship could crack apart.
I'm telling you...
Shed?
I'm just...
If we open those doors...
Please, just listen to me.
Listen to me!
If we out there, we're gonna die.
Hey, hey, hey!
You're in shock.
You're in shock.
You know the symptoms.
You know the symptoms.
Just breathe.
Breathe.
Deep...
Breathe.
Breathe, breathe.
All right.
There.
There.
You chilled?
Okay.
Now, we're gonna go outside, and we're gonna fix the antenna, and we're gonna make some noise and get rescued.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
Watch your step, boys.
We're on the way.
How's it looking out there?
Well, it could've been worse.
It can always be worse.
Okay.
It's worse.
Captain was pissed you weren't around.
She wanted this dealt with.
Yeah, it must be my week.
New Earth partner.
Drawing all the "hot" cases...
Your attention, please.
The Air, Water and Power...
Well, it's about time.
Expected you an hour ago.
It's a long hoof from the Medina, sir.
A week ago, those dead patches started appearing.
My guess is, the Greigas are stealing water again.
Some Belters clearly don't respect the green space's role in recycling the air and the water.
Not to mention the embarrassment it causes the Governor.
You seem sure it was Belters.
The criminals here tend to be.
You're new here, aren't you?
We'll get right on that, sir.
Maybe if everyone in Ceres had this view, they'd respect you more.
There.
Now, you can make your own view.
Oh, shit!
You're an Earther.
And I don't even know where you're from.
We're gonna be space trash in a few hours and you wanna start a friendship?
If you don't think we're gonna make it, what are you doing up here?
Naomi told me to, so I am.
As far as I'm concerned, she's the cap now.
Till I lost my Clementine
Alex, send me some juice to E-12.
How I missed her...
Alex?
Alex!
Oh.
E-12.
Copy that.
There you go, sugar.
You doin' okay up there?
I'm doing as good as dew on a mornin' full of sunshine.
Hey, what's the deal with you and Naomi?
You two an item or something?
An item?
Hey, it's none of my business, but...
You must think I'm pretty stupid, don't you?
I mean, you're right.
I can take a core apart and put it back together with my eyes closed.
But ask me whether or not I should rip your helmet off and kick you off this bucket, and I couldn't give you a reason why I should or shouldn't.
Except Naomi wouldn't like it.
Could you pass me the drill?
Thank you.
Then I lost my Clementine
Alex, what are you doing?
I'm bringin' her home, honey-pie.
One more, two...
And we'll be together.
Just one trip to Ganymede, sweetheart.
Oh, don't be like that, sugar, I said I'm comin' home.
Alex.
Shed, what's wrong with him?
He's, uh...
He's hypoxic.
Oh, shit!
His breather's crapping out.
Damn it!
How long can he hold on?
Oh, oh, shit.
We're losin' him.
We're coming back in.
Negative.
We don't have enough oxygen to vent again.
Shed, take care of him!
Do something!
We're in a vacuum!
He's in a suit!
I...
What do you want me to do?
There's no spare!
Shed, you're a medic!
Act like one!
Hold on, buddy.
Listen, I'm hooking our breathers up, okay?
So we can share air.
So you can breathe off mine, okay?
Shed, what's happening?
Okay.
Hold on, buddy.
Come on.
Hold on, Alex!
Come on.
Yeah, there it is!
Breathe!
Breathe, Alex!
Breathe it in.
Breathe.
Just keep breathing.
We're buddy-breathing.
It's all gonna be good.
It's all good.
Shed, you got this?
No one else dies today.
If we don't get that radio back, we all die...
Today.
Okay, Alex.
My turn, buddy.
I just need a couple of breaths.
Ah, that's the stuff.
How's Alex doing?
He's hanging in there.
What does that mean?
Means he's hanging in there!
Get on with it.
Hurry up.
Don't look at it.
Just think about something else, okay?
Like your kid.
Think about your kid.
Swinging on a...
Swinging on a swing or something.
You're trying to distract me.
Hey, guys.
We're running out of...
We're running out of air.
Now?
No carrier.
Ah, piece of shit!
We have connection.
Get back in here now!
Come on.
- Go!
- Pressurizing.
Ow!
What the hell did you do to me?
You saved my hide, partner.

We're gonna just have to pray there's another caring soul out there like Ade.
Ade?
She's why we're in this shit right now.
If she hadn't gone and logged that stupid distress call...
Hey!
You don't know what you are talking about.
You wanna keep your teeth in your mouth...
We're wasting air.
Give me a hand over here, will you, buddy?
You want to unburden your soul, do it on your own time.
On the remotest chance we get off this alive.
We have enough problems right now.
Yes, sir.
You know that guy was telling you to go... hump yourself.
Yeah.
Geez...
Really?
I hadn't realized that.
I've got plans for it, anyway.
Not even gonna ask.
Nice tat.
Your boss lets you wear your colors like that, out in the open?
Boss has one just like it.
Here's the one.
Feeds the south-east corner of the gardens.
This guy?
Yeah.
Look it, here.
Sensor box should be to your right.
Amateurs.
But you gotta admire their stones for hittin' the park.
Where did you say this pipe diverts to?
Twelfth Level, condenser grid.
It's in a warehouse.
Even water like this today,
Belter loader gonna want it.
Huh?
Hmm?
Sa baka.
It's good!
Good.
We can sell im.
Let's make some money!
Star Helix, don't move!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Be smart.
Come on, kid.
Huh?
Is that everything you got?
Hey...
Hey!
Doing my work, cop.
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you punks doing stealing-up tunnel water?
Free sample.
All piss and vinegar.
You know, you're lucky it's us chasing you and not the Greigas.
They would feed you your fingers, for playin' in their district.
Greigas gone.
This is our turf now.
Nobody just abandons their territory to a bunch of street punks.
You see, the Greigas were smart.
They'd siphon a little water, and sell it off...
Nobody's the wiser.
But you, you gutter punks.
You screwed the golden goose.
Mmm?
Okay, man.
Schoolin' me on gangsters, ke?
Yeah, dirtbag school's in session.
Listen, pick all the pockets you want, roll drunks...
But when you mess with the water, that's when you're going down.
Maybe a couple of years on a prison barge will set him straight.
Huh?
Would you like that?
Do what you gotta do.
Hey...
Hey!
Get out of here.
Stay away from da awkwa!
Tell all your friends!
I did not see that coming.
Yeah?
How about this?
You see that coming?
Yeah.
Madam, I apologize for calling so late.
There's been an incident on the shuttle to Luna.
Go on.
The prisoner, Heikki Sobong took his own life by avoiding the high-gravity injections from his crash couch.
It appears he broke free of his restraints, during the critical phase of the ascent, when he knew the guards would be receiving their own injections.
I think, madam, he is making a statement.
Speak frankly, please.
Earth's gravity.
We used it to hurt him.
He threw it back in our face.
You want to clue us in?
This beacon we answered isn't pirate tech...
It's top-grade military stuff.
Serial stamp on the main board.
Martian Congressional Navy.
That makes no kind of sense.
It makes all kinds of sense.
That ship that attacked the Cant wasn't tucked behind an asteroid, it was hiding in plain sight.
A stealth ship...
Why would they nuke a civilian ship without warning?
Because they can.
Whoa.
What the hell are we tangled up in here?
Who gives a shit?
Let's focus on staying alive.
We'll worry about Mars later.
Good so far?
Good signal.
We've got three hours of juice.
Well...
I guess all we gotta do now is pop a cold beer, and wait to be rescued.
Nope.
Got no record of a Razorback on these docks.
Any, um, special hangar where rich people keep their pleasure-craft?
On Ceres?
Not last I heard.
Now, there's a girl I'm not gonna forget anytime soon.
Yeah, why's that?
Uh, few rotations back, some dock-jock was slobbering all over her while she was prepping to ship out.
Eh, guy must've mistaken her good manners for encouragement, and when he laid hands on her,
God damn, she planted him in the deck.
That girl had skills.
What ship was that?
Scopuli.
Dumpy old transport.
No cargo, just this young lady and a few crew.
Send me the ship manifest, will you?
And transponder logs, et cetera?
She in some kind of trouble?
I'm sure it's nothin' she can't handle.
Alex?
Someone heard us.
Someone heard us?
Yeah.
Are they coming?
Just waiting for the bounce back.
What is that?
Ship en route.
How far?
It's almost 80,000 clicks.
It's gonna be a hell of a close shave.
We'll make it.
What?
What is it?
The ship.
It's Mars.
What?
The Donnager.
The flagship of the Martian Navy.
Coming to finish the job.
And we just told 'em where we were.
Continues to appear for the raider Canterbury which disappeared while responding to a distress call.
The Canterbury was reported to be carrying ice, bound for Ceres station.
And the loss of that shipment has prompted a drastic increase in water rationing station-wide.
A spokesperson...
Hey.
Hey.
Good golly, Ms. Mao.
You sure can pick 'em.
Find your lost heiress yet?
Well...
She's not on Ceres.
Shipped out on the Scopuli.
It just went dark right after take-off.
Vanished.
The week for vanishing ships.
You'd think a rich girl like her would've had that birthmark fixed.
I don't know.
If it was a birthmark, her parents would have had it fixed.
That's a scar.
I don't think she wanted it fixed.
Why do you say that?
Oh, it's a badge of defiance.
Against everything she's supposed to be.
Wow.
She tell you that herself?
Yeah, she did.
Listen, we're the only ones who know what happened to the Cant.
We get on that ship and chances are we're never comin' out.
Unless...
What are you doing?
Buying us insurance.
My name is James Holden, speaking for the five survivors of the Canterbury.
Our ship was destroyed answering a bogus SOS from a ship called the Scopuli.
We recovered a false beacon and identified it as Martian Naval technology.
It was a trap.
Are you insane?
We are about to be taken aboard the MCRN Donnager.
Alex, shut him down!
He's locked us out.
He's locked us out!
Hey, whoa, whoa!
You don't speak for us.
We intend to cooperate and hope this means we won't be harmed.
Should I smoke him?
Say the word.
We're dead anyway.
Any such action will only confirm that the Canterbury was destroyed by Mars.
It just needs to reach one ship, one station.
Then it'll spread.
Don't count on it.
Their jammers were in range.
You are prisoners of the Mars Congressional Republic.
Move and you die.
Previousy on The Expanse...
Picked up a Mayday.
Looks like a light freighter.
Calls itself the Scopuli.
We're obligated to check it out.
- It's pirate bait.
- Purge the logs.
We never received that signal.
I have something for you.
Little lost daughter case.
So what's my contract exactly?
Find Julie Mao.
If she's still here on Ceres, detain her and ship her home.
Kidnap job.
My pleasure.
Anybody grew up this far from the sun won't give a good goddamn what planet you're from.
Real sky over your head and real gravity holding you on the ground, they don't trust you.
That distress call we never received, it was logged with HQ.
Holden, you'll head up this rescue, or salvage.
Put a shuttle team together.
So, just for the record, guys,
I don't wanna be here right now.
This must be the beacon that called us.
Forwarding you an A-1 tight beam from the Canterbury.
Torpedo launch!
Canterbury, burn like hell, you got incoming.
Real lemon works best, if you could ever get your hands on one.
It's a crucial part of the formula.
Neutralizes acidity, adds body, balances pH.
Something like that.
Here.
A perfect cup of coffee.
Ah!
- It's an acquired taste.
- Yeah.
- So, wait and see.
- Yeah.
Hey, what's your name?
Ade.
I'm the new navigator.
Jim, there's something you should know.
Hoss.
Hoss!
Debris field.
Buckle up!
I'll try to drive us out of it.
How bad are we gonna catch it?
Pretty bad.
Right, sweetheart.
You know how much I love you.
Airlock breach!
We're losing pressure!
Somebody close the hatch!
I'm on it!
Somebody shut that damn airlock!
Son of a bitch.
We're through.
Do we still have scopes?
Damn straight.
Do not lose that ship.
What?
- Jesus, you're not...
- We're going after them.
- Buddy, I don't think...
- We're losing them!
Don't do it, Alex.
They just dusted 50 of our friends.
Well, let's not make it 55.
Alex, I'm telling you to go after that ship.
What if they don't like being followed?
They slip off that screen, they're gone forever.
They'll get away with this.
What is wrong with you?
I gave an order!
You think rank matters now?
Get up, I'll do it myself.
Get up!
We're not going anywhere.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Whoa, whoa!
Let's just take a deep breath here, people.
All of you.
Water ration exceeded.
Water ration exceeded.
They're trying to thirst us out.
- Who's that?
- Earth, Mars.
The water shipment's not late, copain.
They're holdin' it back.
You seem pretty sure about that.
Water means life.
One shipment late, you got protests.
Two shipments late, you got dead people in the street.
And it's gonna get worse.
Mark my words.
Christ.
"Father, bother, poured hot coffee in the parking lot."
"Father, bother, poured hot coffee in the parking lot."
Home.
I'm home.
Show me my files.
Copy all files.
Replay my last messages.
I tried to give you the best of all worlds, and you choose to live like some filthy handmaid among the riff-raff of the Solar System.
Since you have no intention of returning home,
I'm forced to consider selling The Razorback.
You're naive, sweetheart.
It's time to come home.
Please.
I'll make everything right again.
Jesus.
Spare me.
Show me my replies.
You're so blind and so condescending and you're never gonna change.
If you won't take yourself seriously as an adult, then why should I care about being your child?
You want to sell The Razorback?
Do it.
You can't buy me off or control me anymore.
Maybe what you hate about me the most is that I remind you of yourself.
Keep it up, partner.
You'll get there.
_
Is it true that you had a Belter up on hooks for 20 hours?
He's an O.P.A. smuggler and a terrorist.
The Secretary-General...
He didn't want to talk...
The Secretary-General has publicly disavowed gravity torture.
If you want to talk to that Belter, you put him in the tank.
You know who I am?
I've heard of you, yes.
Many interesting tales.
You're well-spoken for an O.P.A. soldier.
Because I'm a Belter, I'm naturally O.P.A.?
I'm just a citizen of the Belt.
I work for the future of my people as you do for yours.
Then for the future of both our people,
I need to know how you got your hands on restricted stealth technology that could destroy the balance in the system.
You mean the balance between Earth and Mars.
Either way, it's a lousy deal for Belters.
The O.P.A. demands legitimacy through violence.
They haven't earned it any other way.
No?
You talk to me through a piece of glass, you see my body which can no longer survive on the very planet that bore my great-grandmother.
Earth has created a race of exiles out in space, who have no homes to return to.
Should this go unanswered?
I don't mean to make you afraid, madame.
Have I given you the impression that I'm afraid?
Then why waste your time on a meaningless courier like myself?
You're too modest, child.
Someone entrusted you to transport pieces of the holy grail.
The question is, who?
There are places far worse than this.
And I imagine there is a mother somewhere who'll love to see her boy again.
Est cela ça, madame.
I understand.
We all have our duty.
_
We've got a dead radio and about four hours of oxygen left.
Alex, how much burn do we have?
I could get us maybe a third of the way to Ganymede Station, maybe.
Or get us right to the edge of the shipping lanes, and then we'd have to pray someone tripped over us.
It won't happen.
With a dead transponder, we're just like space trash.
What's wrong with the radio?
Board's cooked, and I'm guessing the antenna array up top has seen better days.
See if you can improvise another board.
I'm gonna go outside and see what's what.
Great.
We'll wait here.
I don't mean to be a bad news bull or anything, but the airlock's done.
The outer door's gone.
Then we'll have to vent the ship.
Are you outta your tree?
We'll lose all oxygen in the cabin.
Everything depends on fixing that radio.
We're wasting time.
There you go.
Calling the shots again.
I'm going outside.
You got a problem with that?
Amos, go with him.
Whoa!
Let's just hold on for one second.
We don't have to go outside.
We're safe right now.
We open those doors, we're done.
The ship could crack apart.
I'm telling you...
- Shed?
- I'm just...
If we open those doors...
Please, just listen to me.
Listen to me!
If we go out there, we're gonna die.
Hey, hey, hey!
You're in shock.
You're in shock.
You know the symptoms.
You know the symptoms.
Just breathe.
Breathe.
Deep... breathe.
Breathe, breathe.
All right.
There.
There.
You chilled?
Okay.
Now, we're gonna go outside, and we're gonna fix the antenna, and we're gonna make some noise and get rescued.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
Watch your step, boys.
We're on the way.
How's it looking out there?
Well, it could've been worse.
It can always be worse.
Okay.
It's worse.
Captain was pissed you weren't around.
She wanted this dealt with.
Yeah, it must be my week.
New Earth partner.
Drawing all the "hot" cases...
Your attention, please.
The Air, Water and Power...
Well, it's about time.
Expected you an hour ago.
It's a long hoof from the Medina, sir.
A week ago, those dead patches started appearing.
My guess is, the Greigas are stealing water again.
Some Belters clearly don't respect the green space's role in recycling the air and the water.
Not to mention the embarrassment it causes the Governor.
You seem sure it was Belters.
The criminals here tend to be.
You're new here, aren't you?
We'll get right on that, sir.
Maybe if everyone in Ceres had this view, they'd respect you more.
There.
Now, you can make your own view.
Oh, shit!
You're an Earther.
And I don't even know where you're from.
We're gonna be space trash in a few hours and you wanna start a friendship?
If you don't think we're gonna make it, what are you doing up here?
Naomi told me to, so I am.
As far as I'm concerned, she's the cap now.
♪ Till I lost my Clementine ♪
Alex, send me some juice to E-12.
- ♪ How I missed her... ♪
- Alex?
Alex!
Oh.
E-12.
Copy that.
There you go, sugar.
You doin' okay up there?
I'm doing as good as dew on a mornin' full of sunshine.
Hey, what's the deal with you and Naomi?
You two an item or something?
An item?
Hey, it's none of my business, but...
You must think I'm pretty stupid, don't you?
I mean, you're right.
I can take a core apart and put it back together with my eyes closed.
But ask me whether or not I should rip your helmet off and kick you off this bucket, and I couldn't give you a reason why I should or shouldn't.
Except Naomi wouldn't like it.
Could you pass me the drill?
Thank you.
♪ Then I lost my Clementine ♪
Alex, what are you doing?
I'm bringin' her home, honey-pie.
- Hey.
- One more, two... and we'll be together.
Just one trip to Ganymede, sweetheart.
Oh, don't be like that, sugar, I said I'm comin' home.
- Alex.
- Shed, what's wrong with him?
He's, uh... he's hypoxic.
Oh, shit!
His breather's crapping out!
Damn it!
How long can he hold on?
Oh, oh, shit.
We're losin' him!
We're coming back in.
Negative.
We don't have enough oxygen to vent again.
Shed, take care of him!
Do something!
We're in a vacuum!
He's in a suit!
I...
What do you want me to do?
There's no spare!
Shed, you're a medic!
Act like one!
Hold on, buddy.
Listen, I'm hooking our breathers up, okay?
So we can share air.
So you can breathe off mine, okay?
Shed, what's happening?
Okay.
Hold on, buddy.
Come on.
Hold on, Alex!
Come on.
Yeah, there it is!
Breathe!
Breathe, Alex!
Breathe it in.
Breathe.
Just keep breathing.
We're buddy-breathing.
It's all gonna be good.
It's all good.
Shed, you got this?
No one else dies today.
If we don't get that radio back, we all die... today.
Okay, Alex.
My turn, buddy.
I just need a couple of breaths.
Ah, that's the stuff.
How's Alex doing?
He's hanging in there.
What does that mean?
Means he's hanging in there!
Get on with it.
Hurry up.
Don't look at it.
Just think about something else, okay?
Like your kid.
Think about your kid.
Swinging on a...
Swinging on a swing or something.
You're trying to distract me.
Hey, guys.
We're running out of...
we're running out of air.
Now?
No carrier.
Ah, piece of shit!
We have connection.
Get back in here now!
Come on.
- Go!
- Pressurizing.
Ow!
What the hell did you do to me?
You saved my hide, partner.
You crazy son of a bitch.
Ah, no problem.
I need him sent to Luna for deeper interrogations.
Let the team here go another round, they'll break him.
They have a budget, it's already shot to hell.
And unlike you, I have to grovel and promise and deliver to get reappointed.
This concerns me?
How?
You're two heartbeats away from running the government on this planet.
Yet you're accountable to no one.
How does that happen?
This boy isn't some hapless smuggler.
I believe the O.P.A may be trying to obtain stealth weapons.
Everything is not an O.P.A. plot and if Earth can't afford a stealth program, how can a bunch of rock-tossers?
They can't...
Unless they've found a new friend like Mars.
Cold war is a bloodless war.
Mutual distrust and complete co-dependence.
Nobody wants to change that.
Least of all Mars.
That's another thing.
I want every Martian weapons facility under a microscope.
They are.
You know, your Belter will like gravity on Luna better.
That's the only thing he'll like.
I'm afraid for him.
Heaven help your enemies, Chrisjen.
Heaven help us all if Mars and the Belt decide to share a toothbrush.
Bold move, I'll give him that.
What?
The cold war is over, this is something new.
The antenna's working but our signal's still too weak.
The transmitter was severed from the power grid.
It's done.
This just keeps getting better and better.
So we just blew an hour of air for a radio that doesn't even work?
Can't we rig ourselves an amplifier?
We're gonna need a shitload of power.
Take everything apart.
Be fast and be careful, we're inside of a limb with a pin here.
If it has a battery, a power pack, any charge capability, it goes into a part.
I'm sorry, does anyone need a back rub first?
Last one.
Even if someone hears our SOS, they're gonna think we're pirates.
Well...
We're gonna just have to pray there's another caring soul out there like Ade.
Ade?
She's why we're in this shit right now.
If she hadn't gone and logged that stupid distress call...

Find Julie Mao.
If she's still here on Ceres, detain her and ship her home.
Kidnap job.
My pleasure.
Anybody grew up this far from the sun won't give a good goddamn what planet you're from.
Real sky over your head and real gravity holding you on the ground, they don't trust you.
That distress call we never received, it was logged with HQ.
Holden, you'll head up this rescue, or salvage.
Put a shuttle team together.
So, just for the record, guys,
I don't wanna be here right now.

This must be the beacon that called us.
ALEX:

Don't do it, Alex.
They just dusted 50 of our friends.
Well, let's not make it 55.
Alex, I'm telling you to go after that ship.
What if they don't like being followed?
They slip off that screen, they're gone forever.
They'll get away with this.

Is it true that you had a Belter up on hooks for 20 hours?
He's an O.P.A. smuggler and a terrorist.
The Secretary-General...
He didn't want to talk...
The Secretary-General has publicly disavowed gravity torture.
If you want to talk to that Belter, you put him in the tank.
You know who I am?
I've heard of you, yes.
Many interesting tales.
You're well-spoken for an O.P.A. soldier.
Because I'm a Belter, I'm naturally O.P.A.?
(SCOFFS) I'm just a citizen of the Belt.
I work for the future of my people as you do for yours.
Then for the future of both our people,
I need to know how you got your hands on restricted stealth technology that could destroy the balance in the system.
You mean the balance between Earth and Mars.
Either way, it's a lousy deal for Belters.
The O.P.A. demands legitimacy through violence.
They haven't earned it any other way.
No?
You talk to me through a piece of glass, you see my body which can no longer survive on the very planet that bore my great-grandmother.
(INHALES) Earth has created a race of exiles out in space, who have no homes to return to.
Should this go unanswered?
I don't mean to make you afraid, madame.
Have I given you the impression that I'm afraid?
Then why waste your time on a meaningless courier like myself?
You're too modest, child.
Someone entrusted you to transport pieces of the holy grail.
The question is, who?
There are places far worse than this.
And I imagine there is a mother somewhere who'll love to see her boy again.
Est cela ça, madame.
I understand.
We all have our duty.
_
We've got a dead radio and about four hours of oxygen left.
Alex, how much burn do we have?
ALEX:
I could get us maybe a third of the way to Ganymede Station, maybe.
Or get us right to the edge of the shipping lanes, and then we'd have to pray someone tripped over us.
AMOS:
It won't happen.
With a dead transponder, we're just like space trash.
What's wrong with the radio?
Board's cooked, and I'm guessing the antenna array up top has seen better days.
HOLDEN:
See if you can improvise another board.
I'm gonna go outside and see what's what.
Great.
We'll wait here.
I don't mean to be a bad news bull or anything, but the airlock's done.
The outer door's gone.
Then we'll have to vent the ship.
Are you outta your tree?
We'll lose all oxygen in the cabin.
Everything depends on fixing that radio.
We're wasting time.
There you go.
Calling the shots again.
I'm going outside.
You got a problem with that?
Amos, go with him.
Whoa!
(STUTTERING) Let's just hold on for one second.
We don't have to go outside.

JOON:
Well, it's about time.
Expected you an hour ago.
It's a long hoof from the Medina, sir.
A week ago, those dead patches started appearing.
My guess is, the Greigas are stealing water again.
Some Belters clearly don't respect the green space's role in recycling the air and the water.
Not to mention the embarrassment it causes the Governor.
You seem sure it was Belters.
The criminals here tend to be.
You're new here, aren't you?
We'll get right on that, sir.
Maybe if everyone in Ceres had this view, they'd respect you more.

They're trying to thirst us out.
- Who's that?
- Earth, Mars.
The water shipment's not late, copain.
They're holdin' it back.
You seem pretty sure about that.
Water means life.
One shipment late, you got protests.
Two shipments late, you got dead people in the street.
And it's gonna get worse.

Is it true that you had a belter up on hooks for 20 hours?
He's an o.P.A. Smuggler and a terrorist.
The secretary-general...
He didn't want to talk...
The secretary-general has publicly disavowed gravity torture.
If you want to talk to that belter, you put him in the tank.
You know who I am?
I'veheardof you,yes .
Manyinterestingtales.
You're well-spoken for an o.P.A. Soldier.
BecauseI 'ma belter, I'mnaturallyo.P.A.?
I'mjust acitizenof thebelt.

Then for the future of both our people,
I need to know how you got your hands on restricted stealth technology that could destroy the balance in the system.
Youmeanthebalance betweenearthandMars.
Eitherway, it'sa lousydeal forbelters.
The o.P.A. Demands legitimacy through violence.
They haven't earned it any other way.
No?

Have I given you the impression that I'm afraid?
Thenwhywasteyourtime ona meaninglesscourier likemyself?
You're too modest, child.
Someone entrusted you to transport pieces of the holy grail.
The question is, who?
There are places far worse than this.
And I imagine there is a mother somewhere who'll love to see her boy again.
Estcelaça ,madame.
Iunderstand.
Weallhaveour duty.
We've got a dead radio and about four hours of oxygen left.
Alex, how much burn do we have?
I could get us maybe a third of the way to ganymede station, maybe.
Or get us right to the edge of the shipping lanes, and then we'd have to pray someone tripped over us.
It won't happen.
With a dead transponder, we're just like space trash.
What's wrong with the radio?
Board's cooked, and I'm guessing the antenna array up top has seen better days.
See if you can improvise another board.
I'm gonna go outside and see what's what.
Great.
We'll wait here.
I don't mean to be a bad news bull or anything, but the airlock's done.
The outer door's gone.
Then we'll have to vent the ship.
Are you outta your tree?
We'll lose all oxygen in the cabin.
Everything depends on fixing that radio.
We're wasting time.
There you go.
Calling the shots again.
I'm going outside.
You got a problem with that?
Amos, go with him.
Whoa!
Let's just hold on for one second.
We don't have to go outside.
We're safe right now.
We open those doors, we're done.
The ship could crack apart.
I'm telling you...
Shed?
I'm just...
If we open those doors...
Please, just listen to me.
Listen to me!
If we out there, we're gonna die.
Hey, hey, hey!

You're in shock.

Well, it's about time.
Expected you an hour ago.
It's a long hoof from the Medina, sir.
A week ago, those dead patches started appearing.
My guess is, the greigas are stealing water again.
Some belters clearly don't respect the green space's role in recycling the air and the water.
Not to mention the embarrassment it causes the governor.
You seem sure it was belters.
The criminals here tend to be.
You're new here, aren't you?
We'll get right on that, sir.
Maybe if everyone in ceres had this view, they'd respect you more.

Ow!
What the hell did you do to me?
You saved my hide, partner.
You crazy son of a bitch.
Ah, no problem.
I need him sent to Luna for deeper interrogations.
Let the team here go another round, they'll break him.
They have a budget, it's already shot to hell.
And unlike you, i have to grovel and promise and deliver to get reappointed.
This concerns me?
How?
You're two heartbeats away from running the government on this planet.
Yet you're accountable to no one.
How does that happen?
This boy isn't some hapless smuggler.
I believe the o.P.A may be trying to obtain stealth weapons.
Everything is not an o.P.A. Plot and if earth can't afford a stealth program, how can a bunch of rock-tossers?
They can't...
Unless they've found a new friend like Mars.
Cold war is a bloodless war.
Mutual distrust and complete co-dependence.
Nobody wants to change that.
Least of all Mars.
That's another thing.
I want every martian weapons facility under a microscope.
They are.
You know, your belter will like gravity on Luna better.
That's the only thing he'll like.
I'm afraid for him.
Heaven help your enemies, chrisjen.
Heaven help us all if Mars and the belt decide to share a toothbrush.
Bold move, I'll give him that.
What?
The cold war is over, this is something new.
The antenna's working but our signal's still too weak.
The transmitter was severed from the power grid.
It's done.
This just keeps getting better and better.
So we just blew an hour of air for a radio that doesn't even work?
Can't we rig ourselves an amplifier?
We're gonna need a shit load of power.
Take everything apart.
Be fast and be careful, we're inside of a limb with a pin here.
If it has a battery, a power pack, any charge capability, it goes into a part.
I'm sorry, does anyone need a back rub first?
Last one.
Even if someone hears our sos, they're gonna think we're pirates.
Well...
We're gonna just have to pray there's another caring soul out there like Ade.
Ade?
She's why we're in this shit right now.
If she hadn't gone and logged that stupid distress call...
Hey!
You don't know what you are talking about.
You wanna keep your teeth in your mouth...
We're wasting air.
Give me a hand over here, will you, buddy?
You want to unburden your soul, do it on your own time.
On the remotest chance we get off this alive.
We have enough problems right now.
Yes, sir.
You know that guy was telling you to go hump yourself.
Yeah.
Geez... really?
I hadn't realized that.
I've got plans for it, anyway.
Not even gonna ask.
Nice tat.
Your boss lets you wear your colors like that, out in the open?
Boss has one just like it.
Here's the one.
Feeds the south-east corner of the gardens.
This guy?
Yeah.
Look it, here.
Sensor box should be to your right.
Amateurs.
But you gotta admire their stones for hittin' the park.
Where did you say this pipe diverts to?
Twelfth level, condenser grid.
It's in a warehouse.
Even water like this today, belter loader gonna want it.
Huh?
Hmm?
Sabaka.
It's good!
Good.
We can sell it.
Let's make some money!
Star helix, don't move!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Be smart.
Come on, kid.
Huh?
Is that everything you got?
Hey... hey!
Doing my work, cop.
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you punks doing stealing up-tunnel water?
Free sample.
All piss and vinegar.
You know, you're lucky it's us chasing you and not the greigas.
They would feed you your fingers, for playin' in their district.
Greigas gone.
This is our turf now.
Nobody just abandons their territory to a bunch of street punks.
You see, the greigas were smart.
They'd siphon a little water, and sell it off...
Nobody's the wiser.
But you, you gutter punks.
You screwed the golden goose.
Mmm?
Okay, man.
Schoolin' me on gangsters, que?
Yeah, dirtbag school's in session.
Listen... pick all the pockets you want, roll drunks...
But when you mess with the water, that's when you're going down.
Maybe a couple of years on a prison barge will set him straight.
Huh?
Would you like that?
Do what you gotta do.
Hey... hey!
Get out of here.
Stay away from the aqua.
Tell all your friends!
I did not see that coming.
Yeah?
How about this?
You see that coming?
Yeah.
Madam, Iapologizefor callingsolate.

You want to clue us in?
This beacon we answered isn't pirate tech...
It's top-grade military stuff.
Serial stamp on the main board.
Martian congressional Navy.
That makes no kind of sense.
It makes all kinds of sense.
That ship that attacked thecantwasn'ttucked behind an asteroid, it was hiding in plain sight.
A stealth ship... why would they nuke a civilian ship without warning?
Because they can.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Whoa...
What the hell are we tangled up in here?
Who gives a shit?
Let's focus on staying alive.
We'll worry about Mars later.
Good so far?
Good signal.
We've got three hours of juice.
Well...
I guess all we gotta do now is pop a cold beer, and wait to be rescued.
Nope.
Got no record of a razorback on these docks.
Any, um, special hangar where rich people keep their pleasure-craft?
On ceres ?
Not last I heard.
Now, there's a girl I'm not gonna forget anytime soon.
Yeah, why's that?
Uh, few rotations back, some dock-jock was slobbering all over her while she was prepping to ship out.
Eh, guy must've mistaken her good manners for encouragement and when he laid hands on her, god damn, she planted him in the deck.
That girl had skills.
What ship was that?
Scopuli.
Dumpy old transport.
No cargo, just this young lady and a few crew.
Send me the ship manifest, will you?
And transponder logs, et cetera?
She in some kind of trouble?
I'm sure it's nothin' she can't handle.
Alex?
Someone heard us.
Someone heard us?
Yeah.
Are they coming?
Just waiting for the bounce back.
What is that?
Ship en route.
How far?
It's almost 80,000 clicks.
It's gonna be a hell of a close shave.
We'll make it.
What?
What is it?
The ship.
It's Mars.
What?
The donnager.
The flagship of the martian Navy.
Coming to finish the job.
And we just told 'em where we were.
...continuestoappearfor theraidercanterbury whichdisappearedwhile respondingtoadistresscall .

Aspokesperson...
Hey.
Hey.
Good golly, Ms. mao.
You sure can pick 'em.
Find your lost heiress yet?
Well...
She's not on ceres.
Shipped out on the scopuli.
It just went dark right after take-off.
Vanished.
The week for vanishing ships.
You'd think a rich girl like her would've had that birthmark fixed.
I don't know.
If it was a birthmark, her parents would have had it fixed.
That's a scar.
I don't think she wanted it fixed.
Why do you say that?
Oh, it's a badge of defiance.
Against everything she's supposed to be.
Wow.
She tell you that herself?
Yeah, she did.
Listen, we're the only ones who know what happened to the cant.
We get on that ship and chances are we're never comin' out.
Unless...
What are you doing?
Buying us insurance.
Mynameis JamesHolden, speakingforthefive survivorsofthecanterbury.
Our ship was destroyed answering a bogus sos from a ship called the scopuli.
We recovered a false beacon and identified it as martian naval technology.
It was a trap.
Are you insane?
We are about to be taken aboard the mcrn donnager.
Alex, shut him down!
He's locked us out.
He's locked us out!
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Youdon'tspeakfor us.
Weintendto cooperate andhopethismeans wewon'tbe harmed.
Should I smoke him?
Say the word.
We're dead anyway.
Any such action will only confirm that the canterbury was destroyed by Mars.
It just needs to reach one ship, one station.
Then it'll spread.
Don't count on it.
Their jammers were in range.
Youare prisonersoftheMars congressionalRepublic.
Moveandyoudie .
Picked up a Mayday.
Looks like a light freighter.
Calls itself the Scopuli.
We're obligated to check it out.
It's pirate bait.
Purge the logs.
We never received that signal.
I have something for you.
Little lost-daughter case.
So what's my contract exactly?
Find Julie Mao, if she's still here on Ceres, detain her, and ship her home.
Kidnap job.
My pleasure.
Anybody grew up this far from the sun won't give a good goddamn what planet you're from.
Real sky over your head and real gravity holding you on the ground, they don't trust you.
That distress call we never received, it was logged with HQ.
Holden, you'll head up this rescue, or salvage.
Put a shuttle team together.
So, just for the record, guys,
I don't wanna be here right now.
This must be the beacon that called us.
Forwarding you an A-1 tight beam from the Canterbury.
Torpedo launch!
Canterbury, burn like hell, you've got incoming!
Real lemon works best, if you could ever get your hands on one.
It's a crucial part of the formula.
Neutralizes acidity, adds body, balances pH.
Something like that.
Here.
A perfect cup of coffee.
Ah!
It's an acquired taste.
Yeah.
So, wait and see.
Yeah.
Hey, what's your name?
Ade.
I'm the new navigator.
Jim, there's something you should know.
Hoss.
Hoss!
Debris field.
Buckle up!
I'll try to drive us out of it.
How bad are we gonna catch it?
Pretty bad.
Right, sweetheart.
You know how much I love you.
Airlock breach!
We're losing pressure!
Somebody close the hatch!
I'm on it!
Somebody shut that damn airlock!
Son of a bitch.
We're through.
Do we still have scopes?
Damn straight.
Do not lose that ship.
What?
Jesus, you're not...
We're going after them.
Buddy, I don't think...
We're losing them!
Don't do it, Alex.
They just dusted 50 of our friends.
Well, let's not make it 55.
Alex, I'm telling you to go after that ship.
What if they don't like being followed?
They slip off that screen, they're gone forever.
They'll get away with this.
What is wrong with you?
I gave an order!
You think rank matters now?
Get up, I'll do it myself.
Get up!
We're not going anywhere.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Whoa, whoa!
Let's just take a deep breath here, people.
All of you.
Water ration exceeded.
Water ration exceeded.
They're trying to thirst us out.
Who's that?
BOUILLOTTE DEALER:
Earth, Mars.
The water shipment's not late, copeng.
They're holdin' it back.
You seem pretty sure about that.
Water means life.

I'm home.
Show me my files.
Copy all files.
Replay my last messages.
I tried to give you the best of all worlds, and you choose to live like some filthy handmaid among the riff-raff of the Solar System.
Since you have no intention of returning home,
I'm forced to consider selling the Razorback.
You're naive, sweetheart.
It's time to come home.
Please.
I'll make everything right again.
Jesus.
Spare me.
Show me my replies.
You're so blind and so condescending and you're never gonna change.
If you won't take yourself seriously as an adult, then why should I care about being your child?
You want to sell the Razorback?
Do it.
You can't buy me off or control me anymore.
Maybe what you hate about me the most is that I remind you of yourself.
Keep it up, partner.
You'll get there.
Is it true that you had a Belter up on hooks for 20 hours?
He's an O. P.A. smuggler and a terrorist.
The Secretary-General...
He didn't want to talk...
The Secretary-General has publicly disavowed gravity torture.
If you want to talk to that Belter, you put him in the tank.
You know who I am?
I've heard of you, yes.
Many interesting tales.
You're well-spoken for an O. P.A. soldier.
Because I'm a Belter, I'm naturally O.P.A.?
I'm just a citizen of the Belt.
I work for the future of my people as you do for yours.
Then for the future of both our people,
I need to know how you got your hands on restricted stealth technology that could destroy the balance in the system.
You mean the balance between Earth and Mars.
Either way, it's a lousy deal for Belters.
The O. P.A. demands legitimacy through violence.
They haven't earned it any other way.
No?
You talk to me through a piece of glass, you see my body which can no longer survive on the very planet that bore my great-grandmother.
Earth has created a race of exiles out in space, who have no homes to return to.
Should this go unanswered?
I don't mean to make you afraid, madam.
Have I given you the impression that I'm afraid?
Then why waste your time on a meaningless courier like myself?
You're too modest, child.
Someone entrusted you to transport pieces of the Holy Grail.
The question is, who?
There are places far worse than this.
And I imagine there is a mother somewhere who'll love to see her boy again.

Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
Watch your step, boys.
We're on the way.
How's it looking out there?
Well, it could've been worse.
it can always be worse.
Okay. it's worse.
Captain was pissed you weren't around.
She wanted this dealt with.
Yeah, it must be my week.

Oh, shit!
You're an Earther.
And I don't even know where you're from.
We're gonna be space trash in a few hours and you wanna start a friendship?
If you don't think we're gonna make it, what are you doing up here?
Naomi told me to, so I am.
As far as I'm concerned, she's the cap now.
Till I lost my Clementine
Alex, send me some juice to E-12.
How I missed her...
Alex?
Alex!
Oh.
E-12.
Copy that.
There you go, sugar.
You doin' okay up there?
I'm doing as good as dew on a mornin' full of sunshine.
Hey, what's the deal with you and Naomi?
You two an item or something?
An item?
Hey, it's none of my business, but...
You must think I'm pretty stupid, don't you?
I mean, you're right.
I can take a core apart and put it back together with my eyes closed.
But ask me whether or not I should rip your helmet off and kick you off this bucket, and I couldn't give you a reason why I should or shouldn't.
Except Naomi wouldn't like it.
Could you pass me the drill?
Thank you.
Then I lost my Clementine
Alex, what are you doing?
I'm bringin' her home, honey-pie.
One more, two...
And we'll be together.
Just one trip to Ganymede, sweetheart.
Oh, don't be like that, sugar, I said I'm comin' home.
Alex.
Shed, what's wrong with him?
He's, uh...
He's hypoxic.
Oh, shit!
His breather's crapping out.
Damn it!
How long can he hold on?

He's in a suit!
