The worst part is things were really going great between us.
Tell me about it.
Perry and I finally got to the place where we could have sex facing each other.
I finally got so comfortable with her that I was able to be the real me.
I even told her I don't want to have kids.
I just want to adopt a really short old guy.
If she wants to break up with me, that's fine.
But I'm just gonna dump her first.
I'm gonna torture him till he gives up that ring.
Eavesdropping.
Things have been going so great between J.D. and I since we started dating again.
- You want to know why?
- Not really.
No one cares that you two are back together.
Why not?
Because you've been doing it on and off for 7 years.
And if anyone of us ever want to have another stupid conversation about your relationship, all we have to do is think back and remember one of the other billions of stupid conversations we've all had about your relationship.
So Turk, this Elliot chick is pretty hot.
- She got nice boobies.
- Awesome boobies.
- So how's the butt.
- Flat.
Just like I like it.
Oh, yeah.
# J.D.'s gonna hit that flat butt # # J.D.'s gonna hit that flat butt #
# J.D.'s gonna hit that flat butt # # J.D... #
I was just thinking about the first time I told Turk about you.
Look, you guys both have said that you've been happy lately.
Why mess that up over a ring?
And why throw all of that away before you even talk to Lady?
Since I'm part of a couple again, I'm gonna give some relationship advice whether you want it or not.
That's what I do.
I can't help myself.
Still, don't tear things apart just because you're afraid to feel vulnerable.
Oh, look at him.
You're adorable.
You got a daddy?
I'm just window shopping.
Okay, Rich.
Mike's hooked up to the thermoregulation system.
His body's now cooling.
All we can do is wait and hope for the best.
I feel really good about this, you know.
That makes one of us.
Baby, what am I doing?
I am proud of you.
Not just for being smart, but for being brave.
Kiss me.
Where did you get the idea for this risky therapy anyway?
SportsCenter.
Excuse me?
# SportsCenter # # The place for sports #
- Now is not really a good time.
- Okay.
We should talk.
Yeah, I know.
Sorry about that.
- But.
- But.
- You go.
- Oh no.
You first.
- I'd prefer you...
- No, you go first.
I don't know what to say.
Please go.
May I?
I'm not really at the talking part of relationships, but I've given this a little thought.
And, huh...
And here goes.
If I were a catfish,...
See, that's no good.
Catfish is no good.
Let's pretend we're in Africa.
And you're a monkey trying to steal my gold.
I'm a germaphobe!
What?
The reason I don't want to hold hands is that I am a germaphobe.
Specifically, a hand-specific germaphobe.
My therapist thinks that part of the reason I'm attracted to you is that you clean germs for a living.
And you're a dead ringer for my dad.
Whatever, anyway.
I've never told anyone this before.
And I just finally feel so comfortable with you that I want to be the real me.
You know?
I do.
- You're weird.
- Yeah.
I love that.
- Really?
- Yes.
Don't touch the table.
It's full of bacteria.
Thanks.
That sucked.
See you tomorrow, everybody.
Bye Bob!
They're so cute.
But I still think that we're the best couple here.
- No one cares, Elliot.
- J.D., you're in the relationship.
- You have to care.
- Sorry.
Look, you know what I love about where we are now?
I can tell you...
As I took Elliot's hand and nodded to make her think I was listening,
I started to think about hands again.
And how they really are windows to what we're feeling.
Whether it's love...
If you say anything, I'll kill you.
Come here.
Or acceptance.
This is great.
It's like I'm steering you.
Look out for weird coughing guy.
And sometimes, they can even express hope.
So you really think it was the cold therapy that helped him?
I don't know, but I'm glad I did it.
I'm really proud of you, baby.
There's got to be a way I could get on SportsCenter.
Dr. Cox is athletic.
I wonder if he could help.
- What is going on?
- Involuntary luge.
J.D.:
Eagle!
- That's gotta hurt.
- Gloria always does.
Look at how his legs are all twisted.
I'm still not sure why luge is even a sport.
Hey, Zeltzer.
My family is with me here today, but all the tables are full.
Do you mind if we join you for breakfast?
Not at all.
I get family.
I'm here so much I hardly ever see my wife.
That's why I installed a web camera at my house so I can see her during the day.
Right now, I'm watching her do the Dishes.
Who in god's name are those two naked people?
- That's Mr. and Mrs. Dish.
- Get out!
Hi, poppy.
FYI, I fired the cashier and the person that made the scrambled eggs.
- Their accents were unintelligible.
- What are you talking about?
It's one of the benefits of you being the Chief of Medicine.
I can fire people under your auspices.
Also, I didn't have to pay for food.
I got three steaks.
Jordan, that's rid- Give me one of these.
Why isn't he in preschool right now?
'Cause he told me they have the day off for Yom Kippur.
Yom Kippur was six months ago.
I hate school!
Never have been more proud of you.
It's the password to my webcam.
Think you're going to dig it.
Oh, babe.
You got a little smudge there.
- What is that, strawberry jam?
- No, just a little blood from shaving.
Oh.
Sweety.
Don't worry.
I wasn't shaving myself.
Say, Jack?
Don't your think your mom should be just a little embarrassed since she's constantly being outwitted by a 4-year old?
I hate school!
I remember.
Can you please not be a jackass in front of the help?
- I'm gonna get going.
- Okay.
- We're still on for tonight, right?
- I'll answer that with this...
- I don't know what that means.
- You're so cute!
I'm actually baffled.
Am I gonna see her tonight or not?
Was either one of us giving you a vibe that we gave a crap?
Because if so, that's an accident and we're sorry.
Apology accepted.
You know, just because Lady and I are clicking and you guys aren't doesn't matter really.
Just means we're a better couple.
I'm just tired of him saying I'm not a good parent.
- I am a great mom.
- Oh really?
Then where is your son Jack?
Damn it!
Jack!
This is SportsCenter.
After Buffalo Bills' tight end Kevin Everett fractured his cervical spine during a game, the question wasn't whether he would ever walk again.
It was whether he would live.
Thankfully, Mr. Everett's both alive and walking today, thanks to an incredibly risky medical procedure, called "cold therapy".
It's as unproven as it is controversial, with doctors still disagreeing about its very effectiveness.
CARLA:
Turk, if we have another baby, it'll still be pretty financially tight, 'cause we're gonna need to keep the nanny on for Izzy.
Are you even listening to me?
I'm not, baby.
But I was pretending to listen, so I think we can both agree that means I love you.
Turk, this is serious.
I worry about this stuff.
Baby, the only thing I'm worried about is you having another girl.
- I'm surrounded by girls.
- Surrounded?
Yes, surrounded by girls, baby.
You, Izzy, Elliot.
- Who else?
- Hey!
What's that laugh about?
That laugh is never good for me.
- You're a girl.
- No I'm not.
- What's this show, is it new?
- It's SportsCenter, dude.
If you must do that witch cackle, can you please do it in the hallway?
Thank you.
I've been watching this show every day since I was 10 years old.
We've asked you, among many things today, how do you feel about the baseball, the football, the...
So, they just sit there and talk about sports?
Your wife is a dirty whore.
- Dude!
- Sorry, not dirty.
- Dude!
- Not a whore.
How cool would it be to be on SportsCenter?
Welcome to SportsCenter.
America has voted.
The results are in.
And the worse athlete in the world...
It's this guy right here.
I like wearing a helmet 'cause I can do this....
And it only hurts a little bit.
Congratulations, John Dorian.
You are a giant nerd.
So cool.
Season 8 Episode 11 My Nah Nah Nah
It's amazing watching Turk do his thing.
I haven't been to the future yet, but I may be the best surgeon of all time.
Close him up.
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah.
What are you doing?
You were awesome, just like on SportsCenter.
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah.
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah.
I know, that's what I did...
No, hold on a second.
Doe a deer.
No, it's do, it's a deer.
J.D., now is not a good time, okay?
That kid broke his neck.
I want to thank you for dinner last night.
I've eaten by candle light before, but never by firefly light.
It was hard to get them all in the jugs, but I thought that was worth it.
So what do you want to do tonight?
I don't really want to hold hands right now.
Is that okay?
Sure.
You know, that's-- I'm fine with that, whatever.
Like teenage girls say, whatever.
We're cool.
Okay, I'll call you.
Okay.
Hey, janitor.
Rock solid relationship there.
You know, there's nothing like looking in someone's eyes and seeing a part of them die.
There it goes.
Bye bye hope.
Everything is fine between me and Lady.
And excuse me for not having a relationship built on a mutual affection for jet-black hate.
We don't hate each other, do we?
A little bit, but we make it work.
- At least, I can hold your hand.
- There it is.
What's this?
What the hell?
Are you wearing a wedding ring?
You're just noticing that now?
He's been wearing it for months.
- Months?
- Gotta go.
I'm a cutter.
I usually say "Surgery went great" or...
"He's not gonna make it, I'm sorry."
I've never had to tell anyone that their son is gonna be paralyzed
That's gotta suck.
I wish there was an easier way to say this.
Mr. Hill.
Got you a card.
Great to see you, great to talk.
The bad new is...
your son can't walk.
And see, there's a picture of a kitty cat in a wheelchair.
Look at the cat, he's shrugging like "What are you gonna do?"
What are you gonna-- We did it at the same time.
Dude, was the daydream helpful?
Not especially.
I need you to focus.
You're better at this than I am.
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go in there and you're gonna be completely honest.
That's all you've got. 'Cause I've been a doctor for more than ten minutes.
Try not to get too emotional.
If you feel yourself starting to cry, do what I do and think of that gopher at the end of Caddyshack when he dances.
Got it.
And Turk, most importantly...
Don't give him any false hope.
You know.
If you go in there and make him think for a second there could be a happy ending for him, it doesn't work out, they're gonna blame you forever.
I did that, you remember, with my patient Mr. Chazznini
I think about it everyday.
Good luck.
Mr. Hill.
I'm Dr. Christopher Turk.
I need to talk to you about your son.
Mrs. Jensen, your brain CT came back and as you can see, we were able to get all of the tumor.
Unfortunately...
We were not able to remove this.
That's the song that has been stuck in your head.
Dr. Cox.
Hey!
What gives with you wearing that thing on your finger?
It's mainly to detour cougars like Mrs. Jensen here from hitting on me, but it doesn't seem to have stopped you, does it?
What's the real reason?
I don't know.
Lately, I've been feeling warm and fuzzy about the kids, a little less nauseous about you, and then I found this thing stuck to an old piece of gum in the medicine cabinet.
I put it on a couple of months ago and I haven't taken it off since.
Perry, we're not married.
We're two independent people who enjoy each other's company and are perfectly happy.
We're the opposite of married.
- I don't want you to wear it anymore.
- Fine.
Fine, what do you say I melt it down into a bullet and shoot myself with it?
Thank you.
Holding hands isn't so hard, is it?
I guess something's wrong between me and Lady.
Dibs.
Who's Lady?
Apparently she's not a fan of hand holding.
And that's what couples do.
That and sleep head to toe.
I'm just not sure she's the one.
Zeltzer, when were you sure your wife was the one?
That was our fourth date over at her place.
We were sitting by the fire, just staring into each other's eyes.
And I knew then in there that she was the one.
I would have told her, but I had a rubber ball in my mouth.
I've just been zeltzered.
- Mr. Hill.
- It's Rich.
Okay, Rich.
Here's the situation.
Your son is stable, his vitals are good.
But the damage to his spine was quite severe so there's a strong possibility that he could...
He really loved that car.
The one he had the accident in.
He was always cleaning it.
Driving it around with the top down.
Okay, hum...
Rich, the problem with spinal cord injuries...
Do you have any kids, Dr. Turk?
Yeah, I do.
- I've got a daughter.
- They grew up fast.
You know, when Mickey was 12, he was a hell of a football player.
Rich, I'm trying to talk to you about your son.
- Here's the...
- Yeah.
I know you're trying to talk to me about my son.
When I brought Mike in, I saw them poking at his fingers and toes, asking if he felt it.
Dr. Turk, I have a pit in my stomach because I'm afraid you've come here to tell me my boy is going to be paralyzed.
Tell me it isn't true.
We're not exactly certain of that yet.
You're his doctor, what do you think?
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
Listen, just something really funny jumped into my head.
What?
Tell me.
You remember when the gopher starts to dance in Caddyshack?
Don't do the dance, Turk.
Don't do the dance.
Carla, your husband's not doing very well in there.
I can't watch right now, I'm working.
You know, if I was married to him, I'd be more supportive.
You know you said that out loud, right?
I'm not ashamed of who I am.
And there's a 90% chance that the gopher was a puppet, but this right here...
It's hilarious.
- Dr. Turk, what the hell are we doing?
- I don't know.
Rich, there's a strong possibility that your son will be paralyzed from the neck down.
This is unfair.
I'm so sorry.
Please tell me there's something else that you can do for my son.
Anything.
Don't give up on Mike.
Please.
There's a lot a person can express simply with their hands.
Whether it's defiance,
What the hell?
Rejection.
Oh, I said I didn't want to do that.
Why?
We can...
talk about it later, okay?
Looks like somebody is getting their ass dumped.
Or even desperation.
Please, Dr. Turk.
Please help.
Don't do it, Turk.
No false hope, just get out.
There might be something I can do.
- Dr. Turk?
A word please.
- Yeah.
I'm sorry, sir.
One of your patients is very...
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?
Don't you remember my "don't give him false hope" speech, and my lie about how I had done it with Mr. Chazznini.
- That was a lie?
- Yes, Turk.
I lie to drive my points home.
We both know that about me.
Look, I actually have a good idea.
Mr. Hill.
There's a therapy I'd like to try on Mike.
But here's the thing.
It's very experimental.
I don't care.
We're in.
It's not up to me to make the decision, I have to talk to my boss.
Baby, I need to run something by you.
Are you trying to annoy me by wearing your wedding ring?
Because all you really needed to do was wear that "Who farted?" T-shirt.
Now, hun.
And when I say hun, I don't mean the short for honey kind,
But rather the Attila kind.
Despite the fact that wearing our wedding ring may actually annoy you, which don't get me wrong is one of the most stupendous perks in the history of the planet, the truth is
I'm wearing it because I want to.
So that's it, you're just gonna ignore me.
As much as I'll ignore the opening of Hugh Jackman's next cinematic excretion.
Jordan, come one.
Bottom line,
I'm not telling anyone we're married, this isn't for other people, it's...
It's for me, which begs the question
Why on earth would you care?
She can't break up with me if I don't let her talk to me.
I don't know what was odder.
The janitor spouting random non sequiturs or Dr. Kelso doing his daily post-muffin power walk and rubbing in the fact that he's retired.
Must suck to be you people.
Baby, it's a long shot.
But there's a procedure I heard of called cold therapy.
We'd induce a mild hypothermia which would minimize swelling and hopefully reduce the body's metabolic demand, preventing his paralysis.
Hey.
Do you have a second?
Oh honey, I would love to but I'm just right in the middle of something.
Anyway, between the weak American dollar and the, uh... you know low interest rates, I think you'd be absolute fools not to buy a house right now.
And-and-and the subprime mortgage foreclosures have just made it a complete buyer's market
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.
But it kinda made sense.
Look, problem with cold therapy is that it's controversial.
Bottom line:
If there are any complications, that's on me.
I could get sued, lose my license.
Hell baby, we could lose everything.
The car, the college fund.
- The house.
- What house?
The one the janitor was talking about.
What am I supposed to do?
What would you do if it's was one of our kids?
I'd try everything.
There is your answer.
- Say it.
- You're always right.
Well, you were right.
Lady and I are doomed.
Congratulations, Pam.
You think my name is Pam?
You know what, I don't care.
I have my own problems.
The worst part is things were really going great between us.
Tell me about it.
Perry and I finally got to the place where we could have sex facing each other.
I finally got so comfortable with her that I was able to be the real me.
I even told her I don't want to have kids.
I just want to adopt a really short old guy.
If she wants to break up with me, that's fine.
But I'm just gonna dump her first.
I'm gonna torture him till he gives up that ring.
Eavesdropping.
Things have been going so great between J.D. and I since we started dating again.

Engine two looks fine.
How's number one?
Did a compression check.
Engine one looks fine.
We love you, Amelia!
Good luck, Amelia!
Miss Earhart, do you really think you'll break the record this time?
She will fly the world's full circumference, 24,902 miles, to travel across the South Atlantic, crossing Africa, over India...
After this 'round-the-world flight, Miss Earhart, are you gonna give up long-distance flying?
Not while there's still life left in me.
I fly for the fun of it.
Good luck!
All right, give us a big smile!
We love you, Amelia!
Thank you.
That's enough.
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.
Mr. Putnam.
The headwinds were stronger than they knew when they took off.
I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them nine percent.
Nine percent.
When I saw that little plane, it lifted me above the Kansas prairie.
I had to fly.
My daddy had the wanderlust.
That's why I like to keep moving.
Flying lets me move in three dimensions.
Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?
Miss Earhart?
Mr. Putnam will see you now.
Send the papers over this afternoon.
Thank you, bye.
-Miss Earhart?
-Mr.
Putnam?
Please, sit.
I'm told you want to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.
-I do.
-Why do you want to fly?
-Why?
-Why do you want to fly?
Why does a man ride a horse?
Because he wants to, I guess.
Three women have died trying.
Two others have escaped with their lives.
If you do make it, you will be the first, which is the real attraction for both of us, I expect.
Always nice to know what the real attraction is.
The plane was bought from Admiral Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite, who's asked to find an American.
Educated, well-spoken, a flier and preferably physically attractive.
Why would that matter?
Because she wants the world to pay attention.
And pretty girls command more attention.
Was that your advice?
There'll be a contract for the girl's story with The New York Times.
Also a book to be published under her name.
But all the money from this will go to Mrs. Guest.
Except for the part that goes to you.
Well, this is America, and therefore I am obligated to make as much money as I can.
You have a wonderful laugh, Miss Earhart.
You said she wants a flier.
Don't get your hopes up.
The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be pilot.
There will be a male co-pilot who will also serve as navigator.
The woman will be purely a passenger.
Take Lindbergh.
I published his book three months after his historic flight.
Must be wonderful to actually know him, to be a friend of his.
Friend?
Good God, no.
Can't stand the man.
He's a stiff-ass, sanctimonious, boring prude.
Was a bestseller though.
Why would anyone want to read a book written by a passenger?
Because the hook is that they're gonna make the woman commander.
The pilot will sign a contract saying he's under your direction and control.
It would be your flight.
My fraud, you mean.
A very distasteful word in book publishing, Miss Earhart.
I don't know, Mr. Putnam.
My dream has always been to fly across the Atlantic, but the way you want me to do it is far from the way I've envisioned it.
Let me be frank.
With your level of flight experience, I wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would normally be considered for this, if a woman were to do any flying at all.
Miss Earhart, let me be painfully clear,
I give the orders and you take them.
And if you do as you're told, you'll be a star.
And I will be nearby, a small particle of dust in your constellation.
Spoken like a gentleman.
Miss Earhart.
Mr. Putnam.
Of course, a gentleman would've paid for my ticket.
What the hell are they?
Oryx!
Look how free they are!
No constraints, no schedules to keep.
For a gal who don't like schedules, you sure got yourself hooked up with the wrong fella in Mr. Putnam.
Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.
Say hello to Slim Gordon, your navigator.
How do you do?
And Bill Stultz,
-the best pilot working today.
-Hello, Bill.
How much fuel do you lose because of these?
Costs us at least 400 gallons.
Well, then why have them?
The owner wants to protect her plane in case you have to ditch it at sea.
But those are decisions I have to make, not somebody else.
They're not making this trip, we are.
But she owns the plane, and this is still America, Miss Earhart.
Ownership is the trump card.
Sad to say, but dollars put planes in the air.
I wonder if it can keep us up there, not that I've ever had enough to try.
Our job is to figure out how to fly this beauty without gasoline.
Include the whole engine up here.
The name is Amelia Earhart.
Careful up there, Slim.
They're leaving for Newfoundland.
Yes, they'll be taking off for there tomorrow, weather permitting.
Make sure the reporters are there.
Goodbye.
Popping-off letters.
For my dad, my mom, and my sis.
You know, in case.
I'm honored that you would leave these with me.
Who else?
If I do pop off, it's your fault.
Pray I make it.
Not much of a prayer man.
Then at least tip your hat and cross your fingers.
Well,
-see you.
-See you.
It's a short hop from Boston to Newfoundland for Amelia Earhart and crew.
Then on to Ireland, and possibly the record books.
Earhart and top-notch ace Bill Stultz have to get airborne, quite a feat once their plane is fully loaded for the Atlantic crossing.
Seems like we got a situation here, a real problem.
When you figure it out, Commander, let us know.
BILL:
I don't even know what the hell I'm saying anymore.
Here's to Little Miss Earhart, who couldn't lift a pigeon off the ground!
What time is it?
It's time to fly.
Get up, get dressed, we're going now.
Where's the weather report?
It's not good enough.
Great.
Either we fly to Ireland or you're going home today.
Well, it's not good enough.
It's fine.
There's a tailwind all the way.
We'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind will get us to Ireland.
You're dumping fuel?
You're serious?
Just as serious as you're hung-over.
Slim, you go now.
Get the late weather.
We'll meet you at the plane.
Slim, go.
I've got this.
I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill.
He's the most caring and generous and charming and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know.
He's my father.
He's a drunk, and he's let me down all my life.
Now you get out of that goddamn bed, and you fly that plane to Ireland, or I swear to you, I will.
Good.
Slim, start the engines.
This report indicates some degree of risk.
It's a risk I'm taking.
Have a nice flight.
Read tomorrow's papers, Bill!
We'll both be in them.
So, to take off, you pull back on the thing, right?
Go get 'em, Amelia!
Start the clock!
Let's hope this works!
We're up.
We're up.
We're up!
-Good work!
-Well done, Commander!
The fog comes on little cat feet.
It sits, looking over harbor and city, on silent haunches and then moves on.
Listen.
The motors are humming sweetly.
And I feel at home.
You okay?
Be better off if the damn radio would join the party!
Mr. Putnam!
There's a call coming in.
Putnam.
I'm afraid we've lost contact with Miss Earhart's plane, sir.
Keep me informed.
Thank you.
We've been flying for 19 hours plus.
How far to land?
Radio is still out.
There's no way to compute wind speed and drift in the clouds, so God only knows where Ireland is.
There may be an hour of gasoline left.
Probably less.
If we land on the water now, we might have a rescue.
And a failure!
That's out.
Hold on to something, for Christ's sake!
Slim, go help her.
Hang on!
Okay, I'm coming.
Hold on.
Got it.
Take my hand.
-Hang on, Slim!
-Help!
You boys all right?
Oh, God!
Land.
Land.
Look.
We got land!
We did it!
We're alive!
Nice work!
Amazing!
Glory, hallelujah!
We made it!
Hello!
-Hello there!
-Hello, young lady!
-Fine young fella.
-Hello!
Hello there, gentlemen.
Hello!
What do you make of that?
Hurry up with it.
You're going to miss it.
Hurry up, man!
Welcome, Miss Earhart!
Miss Earhart!
Morgan, be careful.
That's precious cargo!
There you go, lovely lady.
Watch your step.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Is it Irish tradition to greet newcomers with song?
I couldn't say.
This is Wales!
Bill, look!
Hello, Dorothy.
Are you going to be the next girls to become pilots?
What?
It feels strange.
We haven't had a moment alone.
Just the two of us.
Miss Earhart, do you have a statement for the Times?
We're so proud of you!
We love you, Amelia!
Amelia!
Not in the rain!
I flew across the Atlantic!
Hold it right there.
Now, this is a list of the shots they want.
Do you have dirt on your face?
I believe you are referring to my freckles.
-They come with the skin.
-I don't like them.
Very heroic.
Think Lindbergh.
Lady Lindy.
That's what they'll call you.
As I look back on the flight,
I think of two questions that have been asked me most frequently:
"Where are you going next?"
and "What did you wear?"
Lucky Strike endorsement.
I wrote the copy myself.
What does it say?
"I don't smoke, but you should"?
No, it says that Lucky Strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship.
Which is true.
I hid them under the seat.
True, maybe, but misleading.
Why would I sign that?
So that Bill and Slim get paid.
Amelia Earhart, the only woman to fly across the Atlantic, just can't keep her feet on the ground.
The publisher George Putnam has commissioned her to write a book on her flying adventures.
-Thanks, fellas!
-You're welcome, Miss Earhart.
You didn't have to come get me.
You do have a dress to change into, I hope.
-Well, it's just a college class, George.
-No, no, no.
No.
You have to take every appearance seriously.
You never know what it might lead to.
Spoken by a man who should know.
What was that for?
Good luck?
What happened to tipping your hat and crossing your fingers?
Oh, I'm afraid I'm way beyond that now, like it or not.
I think I like it.
What did your mother say when she knew you flew across the Atlantic?
Well, she sent a telegram congratulating me and then she said the next time she wants to sit beside me in the cockpit.
How did it feel to fly over the ocean?
Were you scared?
When I looked down at the sea, it seemed much like the sky to me.
As if the sky and the sea were the same.
I felt much as I do when I'm flying upward toward the sun.
Transported somehow to a simple, safe, beautiful place, where everything is comprehensible.
Welcome to the Chicago Congress Plaza Hotel.
Good night, Amelia.
Good night.
It must have been moon glow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moon glow
That led me straight to you
I still hear you...
Dance with me, George.
And I keep on praying
"Oh, Lord, please let this last"
We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs
Seemed to come from everywhere
And now when there's moon glow
Way up in the blue
I'll always remember
That moon glow gave me you
Hello, Elinor.
Mr. Putnam.
Yes, please come in.
Amelia.
Miss Smith.
I've been following your career with a great deal of admiration.
Oh, Miss Earhart, you are such an inspiration.
I never get tired of reading about you.
They're saying you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit.
-On a good week.
-On a bad week.
Depends on whether you want the real or the sell.
Oh, I don't underestimate the value of selling.
A 16-year-old girl makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the East River.
You don't seem to need much help selling yourself.
Actually, Mr. Putnam,
I was hoping you could do to me what you've done to her.
What's your primary ambition?
To take Amelia's place as the number one female pilot.
-You want a tip?
-I do.
If I listened to everyone who said it was impossible,
I'd never be flying.
Don't let anyone turn you around.
-You're all here.
-Thank you.
So lovely to see you.
-Hello.
-Good evening.
Good evening, Miss Earhart.
Marvelous party.
Oh, Amelia.
This is Gene Vidal.
Amelia Earhart, the aviatrix.
She's a friend of George's.
How do you do, Miss Earhart?
Quite well, Mr. Vidal.
Thank you.
I understand you're writing a book about your transatlantic journey under the tutelage of the master.
Yes.
You enjoying your stay here in Rye?
I must say, I'm a bit out of my element.
The distance between this world and where I come from is as great as the distance between the sun and the moon.
And you believe the whole "opposites attract" theory is...
Pure hooey.
Pure hooey.
-Where are you from?
-Kansas.
"Hooey" is a Kansas word?
Yes, I suppose it is.
Public relations.
It's a new field, entirely new.
It's not publicity, not promotion.
Miss Earhart.
May I call you Amelia?
We may be from different worlds, but we have more in common than you might imagine.
-Is that so?
-Yes.
I'm a teacher, at West Point, true, but still a teacher.
What do you teach?
Flying.
Listen, Amelia...
This is the first time I've ever seen you stumped for a word.
What is it?
Marry me.
-What?
-I want you to marry me.
I don't want to get married, George.
I'm not the marrying kind.
Don't you see you and I embarking on a new life?
Dear George.
Only I can make a fulfilling life for myself.
I don't believe that one can have a fulfilled life alone.
Only when it's shared.
Let me share your life with you.
Let me try to give you whatever you want.
When I was a little girl, for my seventh birthday
my father gave me a globe.
And I'd spend hours just spinning it slowly, reading the names of all those strange, faraway places.
Morocco.
Spain.
Ethiopia.
Dreaming that someday I would go to those places, like a wayfarer,
a traveler, a vagabond.
I want to be free, George.
To be a vagabond of the air.
I'll help you get there.
Thanks.
Hello!
Give me the camera.
I am on my shining adventure, flying the world.
No borders, just horizons.
Only freedom.
Dear G.P.,
You must know again my reluctance to marry, my feeling that I shatter thereby my life in flying, which means so much to me.
In this connection, I may have to keep some place where I can go to be myself now and then, for I cannot guarantee to endure at all the confinements of even an attractive cage.
"In our life together,
"I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me
"nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.
"I must exact a cruel promise.
"And that is, you will let me go in a year
"if we find no happiness together."
Only you, my dear Amelia, could say those brutal words to me
and still have me wanting to be with you.
Forever.
Amelia, do you promise to love, honor and obey this man...
Excuse me, sir?
May we take that back a bit, please?
Love, yes, if it's warranted.
Honor, same thing.
Obey, I can't promise that under any circumstances, but the groom understands that.
Please remove "obey" from the prayer so we can wrap this up before the bride runs off.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Announcing the first Women's Air Derby, racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland.
Yeah, that's fine.
What's this we're hearing?
Advance press release.
The gentlemen who are running the Derby are about to announce the race has to end west of the Rockies.
-What?
-Mmm-hmm.
That's absurd, they're cutting out half the route.
What are they thinking?
They're thinking that it would be bad press when you girls start smashing into the Rocky Mountains.
How dare they?
I'm gonna have a word with these gentlemen.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no.
Come here and walk with me.
I think it would benefit women fliers everywhere if Amelia won the Derby.
You know, the publicity would put the race and all of you up there with the boys.
Well, maybe I'll win the race myself.
Well, you can't win if your plane doesn't pass the final inspection.
And let me predict that it won't.
-Well, that's a threat.
-No.
A prediction.
Amelia's the one who said I shouldn't let anybody turn me around.
Yeah, she probably meant me.
Well, obviously she doesn't see me as a threat.
Oh, sure, she does.
She just doesn't care.
Hey, Gladys!
I let the boys in charge know, in no uncertain terms, we're not changing our route!
We'll sail over those mountains like we're eagles.
I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor.
This is what my loyalty requires.
Lady Lindy herself, Amelia Earhart!
Clear!
Amelia Earhart organizes a competition for women pilots.
Nine cities in nine days.
Tragedy strikes, and there are crashes along the way.
The race continues.
Thousands plan to be on hand to witness those who make it as they approach the finish line.
Here they come, folks.
In first place, Louise Thaden from Bentonville, Arkansas!
In second place, Gladys O'Donnell from Long Beach, California.
Third place goes to Amelia Earhart, Atchison, Kansas!
How does it feel to finish third?
A victory for any woman flier is a victory for me.
I'd like to add my congratulations to Louise Thaden and announce that we have formed an organization to promote women in aviation.
Ninety-nine women pilots have applied, so we're calling it The Ninety-Nines.
And we're going to fly forever!
-George?
-Mmm-hmm?
-I've been thinking.
-Yes?
I want to fly the Atlantic.
You already have.
As a passenger.
It doesn't count.
I want to fly it solo.
It's been five years since Lindbergh.
No one has made it solo.
Fourteen have died trying.
I'll make it.
I know I will.
And if you don't?
I'd rather face a watery grave than go on living as a fraud.
What's wrong with that?
I've been very successful at it.
Amelia Earhart demonstrates her flying prowess and adventurous spirit.
And now she is set to climb to new heights on her second attempt to cross the Atlantic.
No more a passenger, this time Miss Earhart will do it alone.
Still sleepy?
Well, I'll nap on the way.
Good news about flying solo, no one making noise.
Do you have money?
No.
A whole 20?
I spent our money on ocean liner passage.
Going to bring you back.
It's non-refundable.
Please do your part.
I will.
Well, see you.
Please clear the runway for takeoff.
See you.
Presently all clear over the Atlantic, keeping an eye on a storm system south of the route.
It was a night of stars, of tropic loveliness.
Stars hung outside my cockpit window near enough to touch.
If Lindbergh did it, you can do it.
No sign of Miss Earhart yet, Mr. Putnam, sir.
If she's on course, the moon should be with her the rest of the way.
Weather updates are coming in every quarter-hour from Kemble.
Le Bourget Aéroport, France.
A galaxy of press, well-wishers and ambassadors alike has gathered here in Paris in anticipation of the historic moment when Amelia Earhart will touch down where Lindbergh did years ago.
The world waits with bated breath as Amelia flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
-Jimmy, look at that there.
-What do you see?
Excuse me, sir.
Where am I?
Uh...
In Gallagher's pasture.
Where are you supposed to be?
When I left, I was aiming for Paris.
Oh.
You missed, you know.
It's over there.
Well, hello, sheep!
Yes.
Miss Earhart has arrived safely, sir.
She's landed in Ireland.
Wonderful.
Wonderful news!
Journey's end.
Here she is, safe and sound on a farm in Ireland having just completed the first flight by a woman across the Atlantic.
And there's the little plane in which she's broken all records.
Well done.
Well done.
Action!
You're on vacation with Amelia Earhart luggage.
Travel the Nile, moonlight...
I'm sorry, I can't say this.
I try to put the freedom that is flying into my clothes!
Eastman Kodak cameras.
Travel the world, save your memories.
The second person to fly the Atlantic solo,
-and the first one to fly it twice.
-Standing room only, good.
Fourteen hours and 54 minutes.
Are you staying for this?
No, I can't.
I gotta meet the features editor at the Post and then organize that photo shoot for the new luggage line.
What's wrong with you today?
Here I am jumping through hoops like a white horse in the circus.
That's what's wrong.
The only way that we can finance your flying is to make enough money to finance your flying.
...Amelia Earhart!
Go on out there.
Thank you!
Thank you very much.
Oh.
Please!
Miss Earhart?
An autograph, please.
Miss Earhart, please.
Miss Earhart?
-What's your name?
-Gore.
That's an unusual name.
I know.
I don't much like it.
We blame his mother.
She was a Gore, roots going back to colonial times.
Hello.
God, do I have to wade through that?
You will have two Vidal men to protect you.
You'll be fine.
You are so much prettier than your pictures.
Well, thank you, but that...
Have you heard from Lindbergh?
What did he say?
"Well done."
Are you gonna write another book?
Yes, if my husband has anything to say about it.
Take my hand.
Come on, Gore.
Let's you and I lead Miss Earhart to safety.
You know, that woman was right.
-Excuse me?
-I felt the same way when I first met you.
You are much prettier than your pictures.
It all seems rather silly considering what's happening out there.
Those men, all those families.
Why have I been given so much?
You've earned the spotlight.
Enjoy it.
You'll be fine.
Just hold on to yourself.
I'm not sure who that is anymore.
She's that girl from Kansas who says "hooey."
Distinguished dignitaries from every corner of the world, please rise and welcome Miss Amelia Earhart, honored guest of President Roosevelt and the League of American Pilots.
I'd like to toast a world-class pilot who, at age 15, became the youngest woman in the world to fly solo.
This year, she's recognized as Woman Pilot of the Year.
Here's to Elinor Smith, an inspiration to us all.
Your husband encourages you to fly across the Atlantic.
My husband wouldn't want me to fly to N Street.
So, he hasn't actually forbidden you?
Franklin doesn't forbid.
He just feels it's a waste of my valuable time to learn since I can't afford to buy a plane.
The wrong Roosevelt got elected.
I did ask about aviation, but he hasn't decided on the structure yet.
It might be under the Bureau of Commerce.
I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it.
I'm sorry, my hearing's failing.
I missed the words "or woman"?
This may be one of those rare instances when the most accomplished candidate turns out to be male.
Is it a name I know?
Gene Vidal.
I love finding the exception that proves the rule.
How do you feel about flying at night?
Whoa!
There we are, ladies and gentlemen, champagne.
Champagne to toast the first lady.
Put your hands on the wheel!
It's dual controls.
No one'll ever know.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to toast to you!
Oh.
Dear God!
Good night.
Well, I shall never, ever forget this night.
She seems quite taken with you.
And vice-versa.
Then again, lots of people are quite taken with you.
If you're referring to Gene, as I know you are,
I was able to get a word in for him, to head the Aeronautics Branch.
How did it go?
It's her husband's decision, but I'm hopeful.
Gene is so fortunate to have you in his corner, Amelia.
He'll help me and I'm helping him.
You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me Why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me
Transcontinental was too ambitious.
Too many hops, too tough on the ladies.
But the shuttle, Washington, New York, Boston, we think it's the future.
Will you go there with us?
What on earth would you need me for?
You're the most famous woman in America, that's what for.
You know, I can see it now.
You on the poster with Gene, a legendary athlete at West Point, two events at the Olympics, a top pilot who's gonna be running the skies for Roosevelt when he wins.
Thanks, Paul.
I think you've even talked me out of it.
Do, do that voodoo that you do so well...
May I ask you a question?
May I ask you a question?
That woman over there.
She's beautiful.
You're the only woman I know who points out other beautiful women.
Lovely legs, unlike mine.
No, I'm sure that's not true.
That's why you wear trousers?
No.
And all this while I thought you just wanted to be one of the boys.
I may have, at one time, but not anymore.
Was that Amelia Earhart?
Sixth floor, please.
Gore!
AMELIA:
I couldn't wait for your visit this weekend.
Lewis.
Lewis.
Help!
Tiger, tiger!
Ah.
The wallpaper.
Coming, Gore.
It's okay.
Do you know why I papered this room like this?
No.
But I wish you hadn't.
It's because I'm very, very afraid of jungles.
So, when I find myself worrying about it,
I test my courage by coming into this room and pretending I'm in the deepest, darkest part of Africa.
In a jungle so thick, I can't even see the sky above.
And I start to feel better right away because I looked my fear right in the face.
Miss Earhart?
Yes?
Could you please marry my father?
Then I'll never be afraid of anything ever again.
Aw.
I'm already married to Mr. Putnam.
Why can't you be married to Mr. Putnam and my father?
I put together one month in Europe.
Had to close some foreign licensing deals, open new markets.
When are you leaving?
Well, the thing is, I'd like you to come.
I don't see how I could.
Well, I've already spoken to the promoters.
They're willing to switch some of the lecture dates, just for us.
Well, it's not just that.
There's my work on the shuttle.
I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
Normally I'd be worried about leaving you here alone, but I suppose that won't be a problem, will it?
What are you trying to say?
Gene, here in our house, when I am here, is one thing.
When I am not here,
-I can't have it.
-I understand.
I can't have it.
Hello?
I found something you'd written.
Quite beautiful.
"To touch your hand and see your face today is joy.
"Your casual presence in a room recalls the stars
"that watched us as we lay.
"I mark you in the moving crowd and see again those stars
"a warm night lent us long ago.
"We loved so then, we love so now."
Thank you so much for writing that.
Even though I'd never seen it.
At the time, I...
George?
George.
Thank you.
How are you?
I wondered if you were avoiding me a little or...
Just very, very busy.
I'm leaving for Indiana.
Edward Elliott of Purdue wants me to build a Women's Careers Department there.
That's a wonderful idea, especially now.
What's special about now?
You don't read the papers?
Not unless someone makes me.
Well, someone should.
They're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose other than publicity, meaning money.
They also harp on a growing list of products you commercially endorse.
How thoughtless of me to be doing all this in a society where no one else is interested in making money, present company included.
People viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's sweetheart of the skies, the wife, mother, daughter they all wish they'd had, would be helpful.
Thanks for the tip.
Thanks for not being defensive.
I've decided I'm resigning as your consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
The public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together.
And you, of all people, should know that whatever I do,
I do so that I can fly.
And I want to fly that beautiful bird as far as it will take me.
I'm going to fly around the world, Gene.
It can't be done.
Well, I'm going to try.
And I'm going home.
To George.
You can't mean that.
Race you to New York City.
Well, are you going to tell me your surprise, or do I need to be physical?
Boy, that's exactly what I want.
Come on, G.P., tell me.
If you're serious about this flying-around-the-world nonsense, then it might be handy to have a plane to fly in.
Except it would have to be an Electra, and they cost... $36,000, after a generous discount from Lockheed.
It may as well be a billion.
Not to mention at least another $36,000 to have it modified and ready.
And your surprise is you robbed a bank?
No, actually, a university.
I persuaded Ed Elliott to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue.
I suggested a budget amount of $80,000 for a suitable flying laboratory.
The Electra?
Your Electra, Amelia.
George!
Well, there is one thing.
The trustees and the donors, they have to be on board also.
Well, that's my job.
I'll do a series of lectures...
No, there will be no more horses, no more hoops, for my Amelia.
Thank you, George.
Even if you don't care if she lives or dies, you know her death will not be a plus for aviation women, or your next campaign.
What if she doesn't die?
What if she just circumnavigates the globe and it's a plus for everyone?
The closest land west of Hawaii is beyond the range of the Electra.
She'll refuel in the air.
She doesn't have the flying skills.
She's taking bigger risks.
Yes.
I'm aware of that.
Don't be so proud of it.
I understand the danger, fellas.
I've studied the route.
What have you come up with?
This is Howland Island.
It's halfway between Honolulu and New Guinea.
It has no elevation, no trees, hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.
It would be almost impossible to spot from the air.
It's really tiny, like a grain of sand in a thousand miles of nowhere.
If you miss this island, you're out of fuel with 2,000 miles to go.
But I'll have Fred Noonan, the best celestial navigator around.
In fact, she's taking Fred along for the whole trip.
Giving up my little arrogance about solo.
Safety first, yes?
You've always had Amelia's best interest at heart.
And for that, we're both grateful.
Stay for supper?
I'd like to, but I'd better be getting back.
Please tell Gore hello for me.
Give him this.
He can track the time zones.
He misses you.
He doesn't understand, really.
Is the new gasket up to spec, Jim?
Everything's good, Miss Earhart.
Hello, Fred.
Ma'am.
-Good to see you.
-And you.
Thank you.
Are we sizing me up?
I'm told midair refueling would be beyond my abilities.
You have to put in time, learn the technique.
Even so, 20%, it works, 20%, you crash, 60%, you don't get the fuel, so you're cooked anyway.
Better odds of hitting that island?
How do you feel about 100%?
Even with cloud cover?
Pan Am told you I'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen.
They did.
Someone else told you I got a drinking problem.
Which is a big part of why we're here, right?
Everyone I ever worked for will tell you, nothing's interfered with my performance, not once.
We'd be looking for an island less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet.
That's what you'd be looking for.
I'd be looking for coordinates on a map.
How can I lose?
Amelia Earhart leaves Oakland for Honolulu, setting out on the most dangerous aeronautic feat ever attempted:
to traverse the waistline of the world.
How about a smile for the people back in the States?
Miss Earhart, look this way.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Take care of her, Fred.
That's great.
Thanks.
One big one for the camera, Miss Amelia!
You know, we've got so much fuel we can't possibly get off the ground.
Much safer than flying.
Well, we'll need enough for a third pass at Howland after you miss it the first couple times around.
Good thinking.
Thank you!
One more, please, Miss Earhart.
Right here, Amelia!
Good luck, Fred!
Good luck, Amelia!
Clear!
No!
You all right?
Good reaction cutting the switch!
You saved our ass!
Come on, Fred!
Right engine, get the right engine!
Hose on there, right underneath.
-We need tetrachloride here.
-Pyrene, pyrene.
Sam, make sure you get a picture of that.
Make sure you get a good shot of their faces!
Turn her up.
Okay, go.
I'll make it good, G.P., I swear to you I will.
I'll make it back and more, I promise.
The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three years.
Maybe.
No, it will, I promise.
Our sales, our prices are going to double.
This just showed them how dangerous it all is.
They were taking it for granted.
They thought I was competent.
Here.
I meant, maybe...
Maybe we can just stop it.
You mean after?
Or even now.
So my exit would be a stupid crash and withdrawing from a world-publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before.
It would ruin us in the bargain.
-Mmm-hmm.
Yes.
-We'd have nothing.
Mmm-hmm.
It's true.
And I'd be fine with that.
That's because you're an idiot.
Lucky for you.
And what if it's not something I need to show the world?
What if it's something I need to show me?
I don't really have a choice, I have to reverse the route.
I'd be facing hurricanes in the Caribbean, monsoons in Africa.
Yeah, but you'll be flying Howland last.
-When I'm most tired.
-Yeah.
So, I just won't get tired.
What's the timetable on the plane?
Three weeks.
She'll be good as new.
We have a remarkable crew here.
-The best that money can...
-Money can buy.
...buy, yeah.
All the money wasted that's never coming back.
You cut the engines.
It would've cost a bundle more to replace a burnt-out plane.
Not to mention a burnt-up pilot.
I overreacted.
The plane was too heavy, I should've used more rudder instead of the throttle.
I...
It's only money.
We'll figure this out.
We always do.
Have you considered, Miss Earhart, that your enthusiasm as a pilot outweighs your ability, as demonstrated by the disaster in Honolulu?
People are saying that you're reckless, a better celebrity than pilot.
Enthusiastic?
Yes.
Reckless?
Not on your life.
I'm a flier pursuing my passion for the fun of it, that's all.
Thank you.
A future flier!
You can do it, Amelia!
Mr. Noonan, over here!
Miss Earhart!
We love you, Amelia!
She will fly the world's full circumference, 24,902 miles, to travel across the South Atlantic, crossing Africa, over India, and across the wide Pacific...
After this 'round-the-world flight, Miss Earhart, are you gonna give up long-distance flying?
Not while there's still life left in me.
Always ready for a new adventure.
Great, great.
Fred, you're on.
Hey, Fred, give us a big smile for the camera!
Come back to me.
Always.
Hurry up, come on!
Hurry up!
Miss Earhart!
Just one more picture, please!
Just one more, please!
Miss Earhart, over here!
Miss Earhart!
See you.
A fairyland of beauty lay below and about me so lovely as to distract a pilot's attention from the task at hand, that of herding a heavy plane out of that great upland saucer and over the mountains that make its rim.
What is this thing, huh?
Whole thing's made of mud.
It's beautiful.
It's like working with you.
Come on, Amelia.
Amelia Earhart has reached Calcutta...
Dad!
Dad!
It's a bulletin!
...but heavy rains have temporarily grounded her.
She will push on to Bangkok, then Papua New Guinea before heading east toward her final destination, California.
We should go, Fred.
Oh, come on!
You're not really taking off?
It's only going to get heavier.
We could be stuck here for days, even weeks.
It's only 700 miles to Bangkok, it's lighter there.
To get that far in a monsoon, you'd need divine help!
Chai?
Thank you.
Come on, Fred.
You think we should turn back, huh?
Nope.
I think we shouldn't have come.
Hi, Joan.
Hello, Frances.
You look beat, lady.
That's funny, you look tip-top.
Why don't you grab a few hours of sleep?
Might as well keep you company.
I've got some good flying stories.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You and your old George.
That's a touching love story.
An honest one, if I say so myself.
I wonder if it's honest enough for George.
If you mean Gene, we're not together anymore.
In that way.
Not for a long time.
You don't think I love my husband?
Actually, I do.
In a certain way.
But you disapprove of how I live?
Hell, no.
It's just like me.
In fact, it's like most guys I know.
Meaning?
Guys love their wives, their girlfriends.
Doesn't mean they don't take advantage of an opportunity.
If you have a point, make it.
I believe I have.
All you need to do is just show up tomorrow morning, show up sober, and get me to Howland Island.
Ready, ma'am.
Thank you.
Feel like stepping out for a smoke?
Oh, I don't smoke.
Or something?
Earhart here.
Putnam here.
You should be sleeping.
You should be working.
I'm running a big adventure here.
I'm a very important fellow.
You told me I was the star and you'd be nearby, a small particle of dust in my constellation.
I thought I was joking.
Guess the joke's on me.
I'll be in Honolulu on the third and with you in Oakland on the Fourth of July, okay?
Don't keep me waiting.
I won't dare.
How's Fred?
On the wagon?
I sent you my movies to lighten the plane.
You wouldn't sell a salesman, would you?
Fred is fine.
He's calculating headwind speed versus fuel as we speak.
So what's that I hear in your voice?
Is he drinking?
I can handle it.
All right, call it off.
Call it off now.
Right now, Amelia.
I mean it.
Right now.
I can handle it.
After the Fourth, we're going home.
Where is that?
For me?
Anywhere you are.
I'm going to like it there.
I'd better, since this is going to be my last flight.
If you insist.
I love you.
Should I let you go now?
No, never.
I'll go tell the world you're on your way.
See you, my darling.
See you, my love.
It looks like she's ready to leave.
Might be easier to just shoot me.
Traveling light, is all.
You got room for 180 pounds of asshole?
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
It's fine.
Everything is.
-Have you filled the other side?
-Mmm-hmm.
Not more than a month ago, I was on the other shore of the Pacific, looking westward.
This morning, I look eastward over the Pacific.
In these fast-moving days that have intervened, the whole width of the world has passed behind us except this broad ocean.
I shall be glad when we have the hazards of this navigation behind us.
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.
Mr. Putnam.
The headwinds were stronger than they knew when they took off.
I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them nine percent.
Nine percent.
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?
Mr. Putnam, I can't reach them, sir.
I tried voice and Morse Code.
No, forget Morse Code.
They didn't take the receiver.
Just stay with voice.
You'll get them.
At ease, sailor.
The direction finder.
How long has this been left on?
The battery's dead.
Itasca, this is Earhart.
We're about 200 miles out.
Sky overcast.
Over.
That's her, on 3105.
She said "cloudy and overcast."
Itasca, this is Earhart.
Sky overcast.
Over.
We are receiving your signal.
Please acknowledge ours.
What is your position and ETA Howland?
Over.
Itasca, this is Earhart.
Unable to hear you, over.
Earhart, this is Itasca.
Did you receive transmission?
King How Able Queen Queen.
Please acknowledge our signals on key.
Please acknowledge.
Over.
She's having trouble with voice transmission.
Stay with Morse.
Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen.
Been unable to receive you by radio.
Cannot take bearing on you.
If you can hear this, please take bearing on us.
Earhart's signal strength 4.
Please take bearing on us and report in half an hour.
We'll make noise in microphone.
We are about 100 miles out.
Over.
She's got to stay on longer.
On air too briefly, bearing's impossible.
Maybe her Morse receiver's out.
King How Able Queen Queen.
This is Itasca.
Can't take bearing on 3105.
Please send on 500.
Or do you want to take bearing on us?
Over.
Intercom top deck.
Double-check the smoke stack.
O'Hare to top deck.
Top deck, come in.
They should be able to see that for 20 miles at least.
Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen.
We must be on you, but cannot see you.
Fuel is running low.
Been unable to receive you by radio.
We are flying at altitude 1,000 feet.
Over.
We are receiving you and transmitting on 3105 and 500 consistently.
Over.
Itasca, we are circling, but cannot hear you.
Over.
King How Able Queen Queen, this is Itasca.
Your signal is strong.
Are you receiving this?
Over.
Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen.
We received your signal, but unable to take bearing.
Please take bearing on us and answer on 3105 with voice.
Over.
Your signal received okay.
It is impossible to take a bearing on 3105 on your voice.
Send us a longer transmission, please.
Over.
A report has come in from the ship for Mr. Putnam.
Oh, God.
Miss Earhart has finally received transmission from Itasca.
Keep us at 7500.
That's her only acknowledgment.
You've got her signal, damn it.
What about the direction finder?
Cipriani reports the battery's dead, sir.
It was left on all night, so we can't track her.
King How Able Queen Queen to Itasca.
Earhart, will you please come in and reply on 500?
We are transmitting constantly on 7500 and we cannot hear you on 500.
Despite constant attempts, the USS Itasca has lost contact with Amelia Earhart.
Come on.
Come on.
King How Able Queen Queen to Itasca.
We are on the position line 157-337.
We are running north and south.
Over.
We hear you.
We hear you.
Are you receiving us?
Earhart, this is Itasca.
Did you receive transmission?
Itasca to Earhart, come in, please.
All the things I never said for so very long, look up, they're in my eyes.
Everyone has oceans to fly.
As long as you have the heart to do it.
Is it reckless?
Maybe.
But what do dreams know of boundaries?
I think about the hands I have held,
the places I've seen,
the vast lands whose dirt is caked on the bottom of my shoes.
The world has changed me.

Engine two looks fine.
How's number one?
Did a compression check.
Engine one looks fine.
We love you, Amelia!
Good luck, Amelia!
Miss Earhart, do you really think you'll break the record this time?
She will fly the world's full circumference, 24,902 miles, to travel across the South Atlantic, crossing Africa, over India...
After this 'round-the-world flight, Miss Earhart, are you gonna give up long-distance flying?
Not while there's still life left in me.
I fly for the fun of it.
Good luck!
All right, give us a big smile!
We love you, Amelia!
Thank you.
That's enough.
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.
Mr. Putnam.
The headwinds were stronger than they knew when they took off.
I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them nine percent.
Nine percent.
When I saw that little plane, it lifted me above the Kansas prairie.
I had to fly.
My daddy had the wanderlust.
That's why I like to keep moving.
Flying lets me move in three dimensions.
Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?
Miss Earhart?
Mr. Putnam will see you now.
Send the papers over this afternoon.
Thank you, bye.
- Miss Earhart?
- Mr. Putnam?
Please, sit.
I'm told you want to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.
- I do.
- Why do you want to fly?
- Why?
- Why do you want to fly?
Why does a man ride a horse?
Because he wants to, I guess.
Three women have died trying.
Two others have escaped with their lives.
If you do make it, you will be the first, which is the real attraction for both of us, I expect.
Always nice to know what the real attraction is.
The plane was bought from Admiral Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite, who's asked to find an American.
Educated, well-spoken, a flier and preferably physically attractive.
Why would that matter?
Because she wants the world to pay attention.
And pretty girls command more attention.
Was that your advice?
There'll be a contract for the girl's story with The New York Times.
Also a book to be published under her name.
But all the money from this will go to Mrs. Guest.
Except for the part that goes to you.
Well, this is America, and therefore I am obligated to make as much money as I can.
You have a wonderful laugh, Miss Earhart.
You said she wants a flier.
Don't get your hopes up.
The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be pilot.
There will be a male co-pilot who will also serve as navigator.
The woman will be purely a passenger.
Take Lindbergh.
I published his book three months after his historic flight.
Must be wonderful to actually know him, to be a friend of his.
Friend?
Good God, no.
Can't stand the man.
He's a stiff-ass, sanctimonious, boring prude.
Was a bestseller though.
Why would anyone want to read a book written by a passenger?
Because the hook is that they're gonna make the woman commander.
The pilot will sign a contract saying he's under your direction and control.
It would be your flight.
My fraud, you mean.
A very distasteful word in book publishing, Miss Earhart.
I don't know, Mr. Putnam.
My dream has always been to fly across the Atlantic, but the way you want me to do it is far from the way I've envisioned it.
Let me be frank.
With your level of flight experience, I wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would normally be considered for this, if a woman were to do any flying at all.
Miss Earhart, let me be painfully clear,
I give the orders and you take them.
And if you do as you're told, you'll be a star.
And I will be nearby, a small particle of dust in your constellation.
Spoken like a gentleman.
Miss Earhart.
Mr. Putnam.
Of course, a gentleman would've paid for my ticket.
What the hell are they?
Oryx!
Look how free they are!
No constraints, no schedules to keep.
For a gal who don't like schedules, you sure got yourself hooked up with the wrong fella in Mr. Putnam.
Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.
Say hello to Slim Gordon, your navigator.
How do you do?
And Bill Stultz,
- the best pilot working today.
- Hello, Bill.
How much fuel do you lose because of these?
Costs us at least 400 gallons.
Well, then why have them?
The owner wants to protect her plane in case you have to ditch it at sea.
But those are decisions I have to make, not somebody else.
They're not making this trip, we are.
But she owns the plane, and this is still America, Miss Earhart.
Ownership is the trump card.
Sad to say, but dollars put planes in the air.
I wonder if it can keep us up there, not that I've ever had enough to try.
Our job is to figure out how to fly this beauty without gasoline.
Include the whole engine up here.
The name is Amelia Earhart.
Careful up there, Slim.
They're leaving for Newfoundland.
Yes, they'll be taking off for there tomorrow, weather permitting.
Make sure the reporters are there.
Goodbye.
Popping-off letters.
For my dad, my mom, and my sis.
You know, in case.
I'm honored that you would leave these with me.
Who else?
If I do pop off, it's your fault.
Pray I make it.
Not much of a prayer man.
Then at least tip your hat and cross your fingers.
Well,
- see you.
- See you.
It's a short hop from Boston to Newfoundland for Amelia Earhart and crew.
Then on to Ireland, and possibly the record books.
Earhart and top-notch ace Bill Stultz have to get airborne, quite a feat once their plane is fully loaded for the Atlantic crossing.
Seems like we got a situation here, a real problem.
When you figure it out, Commander, let us know.
I don't even know what the hell I'm saying anymore.
Here's to Little Miss Earhart, who couldn't lift a pigeon off the ground!
What time is it?
It's time to fly.
Get up, get dressed, we're going now.
Where's the weather report?
It's not good enough.
Great.
Either we fly to Ireland or you're going home today.
Well, it's not good enough.
It's fine.
There's a tailwind all the way.
We'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind will get us to Ireland.
You're dumping fuel?
You're serious?
Just as serious as you're hung-over.
Slim, you go now.
Get the late weather.
We'll meet you at the plane.
Slim, go.
I've got this.
I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill.
He's the most caring and generous and charming and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know.
He's my father.
He's a drunk, and he's let me down all my life.
Now you get out of that goddamn bed, and you fly that plane to Ireland, or I swear to you, I will.
Good.
Slim, start the engines.
This report indicates some degree of risk.
It's a risk I'm taking.
Have a nice flight.
Read tomorrow's papers, Bill!
We'll both be in them.
So, to take off, you pull back on the thing, right?
Go get 'em, Amelia!
Start the clock!
Let's hope this works!
We're up.
We're up.
We're up!
- Good work!
- Well done, Commander!
The fog comes on little cat feet.
It sits, looking over harbor and city, on silent haunches and then moves on.
Listen.
The motors are humming sweetly.
And I feel at home.
You okay?
Be better off if the damn radio would join the party!
Mr. Putnam!
There's a call coming in.
Putnam.
I'm afraid we've lost contact with Miss Earhart's plane, sir.
Keep me informed.
Thank you.
We've been flying for 19 hours plus.
How far to land?
Radio is still out.
There's no way to compute wind speed and drift in the clouds, so God only knows where Ireland is.
There may be an hour of gasoline left.
Probably less.
If we land on the water now, we might have a rescue.
And a failure!
That's out.
Hold on to something, for Christ's sake!
Slim, go help her.
Hang on!
Okay, I'm coming.
Hold on.
Got it.
Take my hand.
- Hang on, Slim!
- Help!
You boys all right?
Oh, God!
Land.
Land.
Look.
We got land!
We did it!
We're alive!
Nice work!
Amazing!
Glory, hallelujah!
We made it!
Hello!
- Hello there!
- Hello, young lady!
- Fine young fella.
- Hello!
Hello there, gentlemen.
Hello!
What do you make of that?
Hurry up with it.
You're going to miss it.
Hurry up, man!
Welcome, Miss Earhart!
Miss Earhart!
Morgan, be careful.
That's precious cargo!
There you go, lovely lady.
Watch your step.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Is it Irish tradition to greet newcomers with song?
I couldn't say.
This is Wales!
Bill, look!
Hello, Dorothy.
Are you going to be the next girls to become pilots?
What?
It feels strange.
We haven't had a moment alone.
Just the two of us.
Miss Earhart, do you have a statement for the Times?
We're so proud of you!
We love you, Amelia!
Amelia!
Not in the rain!
I flew across the Atlantic!
Hold it right there.
Now, this is a list of the shots they want.
Do you have dirt on your face?
I believe you are referring to my freckles.
- They come with the skin.
- I don't like them.
Very heroic.
Think Lindbergh.
Lady Lindy.
That's what they'll call you.
As I look back on the flight,
I think of two questions that have been asked me most frequently:
"Where are you going next?"
and "What did you wear?"
Lucky Strike endorsement.
I wrote the copy myself.
What does it say?
"I don't smoke, but you should"?
No, it says that Lucky Strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship.
Which is true.
I hid them under the seat.
True, maybe, but misleading.
Why would I sign that?
So that Bill and Slim get paid.
Amelia Earhart, the only woman to fly across the Atlantic, just can't keep her feet on the ground.
The publisher George Putnam has commissioned her to write a book on her flying adventures.
- Thanks, fellas!
- You're welcome, Miss Earhart.
You didn't have to come get me.
You do have a dress to change into, I hope.
- Well, it's just a college class, George.
- No, no, no.
No.
You have to take every appearance seriously.
You never know what it might lead to.
Spoken by a man who should know.
What was that for?
Good luck?
What happened to tipping your hat and crossing your fingers?
Oh, I'm afraid I'm way beyond that now, like it or not.
I think I like it.
What did your mother say when she knew you flew across the Atlantic?
Well, she sent a telegram congratulating me and then she said the next time she wants to sit beside me in the cockpit.
How did it feel to fly over the ocean?
Were you scared?
When I looked down at the sea, it seemed much like the sky to me.
As if the sky and the sea were the same.
I felt much as I do when I'm flying upward toward the sun.
Transported somehow to a simple, safe, beautiful place, where everything is comprehensible.
Welcome to the Chicago Congress Plaza Hotel.
Good night, Amelia.
Good night.
It must have been moon glow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moon glow
That led me straight to you
I still hear you...
Dance with me, George.
And I keep on praying
"Oh, Lord, please let this last"
We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs
Seemed to come from everywhere
And now when there's moon glow
Way up in the blue
I'll always remember
That moon glow gave me you
Hello, Elinor.
Mr. Putnam.
Yes, please come in.
Amelia.
Miss Smith.
I've been following your career with a great deal of admiration.
Oh, Miss Earhart, you are such an inspiration.
I never get tired of reading about you.
They're saying you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit.
- On a good week.
- On a bad week.
Depends on whether you want the real or the sell.
Oh, I don't underestimate the value of selling.
A 16-year-old girl makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the East River.
You don't seem to need much help selling yourself.
Actually, Mr. Putnam,
I was hoping you could do to me what you've done to her.
What's your primary ambition?
To take Amelia's place as the number one female pilot.
- You want a tip?
- I do.
If I listened to everyone who said it was impossible,
I'd never be flying.
Don't let anyone turn you around.
- You're all here.
- Thank you.
So lovely to see you.
- Hello.
- Good evening.
Good evening, Miss Earhart.
Marvelous party.
Oh, Amelia.
This is Gene Vidal.
Amelia Earhart, the aviatrix.
She's a friend of George's.
How do you do, Miss Earhart?
Quite well, Mr. Vidal.
Thank you.
I understand you're writing a book about your transatlantic journey under the tutelage of the master.
Yes.
You enjoying your stay here in Rye?
I must say, I'm a bit out of my element.
The distance between this world and where I come from is as great as the distance between the sun and the moon.
And you believe the whole "opposites attract" theory is...
Pure hooey.
- Where are you from?
- Kansas.
"Hooey" is a Kansas word?
Yes, I suppose it is.
Public relations.
It's a new field, entirely new.
It's not publicity, not promotion.
Miss Earhart.
May I call you Amelia?
We may be from different worlds, but we have more in common than you might imagine.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
I'm a teacher, at West Point, true, but still a teacher.
What do you teach?
Flying.
Listen, Amelia...
This is the first time I've ever seen you stumped for a word.
What is it?
Marry me.
- What?
- I want you to marry me.
I don't want to get married, George.
I'm not the marrying kind.
Don't you see you and I embarking on a new life?
Dear George.
Only I can make a fulfilling life for myself.
I don't believe that one can have a fulfilled life alone.
Only when it's shared.
Let me share your life with you.
Let me try to give you whatever you want.
When I was a little girl, for my seventh birthday
my father gave me a globe.
And I'd spend hours just spinning it slowly, reading the names of all those strange, faraway places.
Morocco.
Spain.
Ethiopia.
Dreaming that someday I would go to those places, like a wayfarer,
a traveler, a vagabond.
I want to be free, George.
To be a vagabond of the air.
I'll help you get there.
Thanks.
Hello!
Give me the camera.
I am on my shining adventure, flying the world.
No borders, just horizons.
Only freedom.
Dear G.P.,
You must know again my reluctance to marry, my feeling that I shatter thereby my life in flying, which means so much to me.
In this connection, I may have to keep some place where I can go to be myself now and then, for I cannot guarantee to endure at all the confinements of even an attractive cage.
"In our life together,
"I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me
"nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.
"I must exact a cruel promise.
"And that is, you will let me go in a year
"if we find no happiness together."
Only you, my dear Amelia, could say those brutal words to me
and still have me wanting to be with you.
Forever.
Amelia, do you promise to love, honor and obey this man...
Excuse me, sir?
May we take that back a bit, please?
Love, yes, if it's warranted.
Honor, same thing.
Obey, I can't promise that under any circumstances, but the groom understands that.
Please remove "obey" from the prayer so we can wrap this up before the bride runs off.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Announcing the first Women's Air Derby, racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland.
Yeah, that's fine.
What's this we're hearing?
Advance press release.
The gentlemen who are running the Derby are about to announce the race has to end west of the Rockies.
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.
That's absurd, they're cutting out half the route.
What are they thinking?
They're thinking that it would be bad press when you girls start smashing into the Rocky Mountains.
How dare they?
I'm gonna have a word with these gentlemen.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no.
Come here and walk with me.
I think it would benefit women fliers everywhere if Amelia won the Derby.
You know, the publicity would put the race and all of you up there with the boys.
Well, maybe I'll win the race myself.
Well, you can't win if your plane doesn't pass the final inspection.
And let me predict that it won't.
- Well, that's a threat.
- No.
A prediction.
Amelia's the one who said I shouldn't let anybody turn me around.
Yeah, she probably meant me.
Well, obviously she doesn't see me as a threat.
Oh, sure, she does.
She just doesn't care.
Hey, Gladys!
I let the boys in charge know, in no uncertain terms, we're not changing our route!
We'll sail over those mountains like we're eagles.
I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor.
This is what my loyalty requires.
Lady Lindy herself, Amelia Earhart!
Clear!
Amelia Earhart organizes a competition for women pilots.
Nine cities in nine days.
Tragedy strikes, and there are crashes along the way.
The race continues.
Thousands plan to be on hand to witness those who make it as they approach the finish line.
Here they come, folks.
In first place, Louise Thaden from Bentonville, Arkansas!
In second place, Gladys O'Donnell from Long Beach, California.
Third place goes to Amelia Earhart, Atchison, Kansas!
How does it feel to finish third?
A victory for any woman flier is a victory for me.
I'd like to add my congratulations to Louise Thaden and announce that we have formed an organization to promote women in aviation.
Ninety-nine women pilots have applied, so we're calling it The Ninety-Nines.
And we're going to fly forever!
- George?
- Mmm-hmm?
- I've been thinking.
- Yes?
I want to fly the Atlantic.
You already have.
As a passenger.
It doesn't count.
I want to fly it solo.
It's been five years since Lindbergh.
No one has made it solo.
Fourteen have died trying.
I'll make it.
I know I will.
And if you don't?
I'd rather face a watery grave than go on living as a fraud.
What's wrong with that?
I've been very successful at it.
Amelia Earhart demonstrates her flying prowess and adventurous spirit.
And now she is set to climb to new heights on her second attempt to cross the Atlantic.
No more a passenger, this time Miss Earhart will do it alone.
Still sleepy?
Well, I'll nap on the way.
Good news about flying solo, no one making noise.
Do you have money?
No.
A whole 20?
I spent our money on ocean liner passage.
Going to bring you back.
It's non-refundable.
Please do your part.
I will.
Well, see you.
Please clear the runway for takeoff.
See you.
Presently all clear over the Atlantic, keeping an eye on a storm system south of the route.
It was a night of stars, of tropic loveliness.
Stars hung outside my cockpit window near enough to touch.
If Lindbergh did it, you can do it.
No sign of Miss Earhart yet, Mr. Putnam, sir.
If she's on course, the moon should be with her the rest of the way.
Weather updates are coming in every quarter-hour from Kemble.
Le Bourget Aéroport, France.
A galaxy of press, well-wishers and ambassadors alike has gathered here in Paris in anticipation of the historic moment when Amelia Earhart will touch down where Lindbergh did years ago.
The world waits with bated breath as Amelia flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
- Jimmy, look at that there.
- What do you see?
Excuse me, sir.
Where am I?
Uh...
In Gallagher's pasture.
Where are you supposed to be?
When I left, I was aiming for Paris.
Oh.
You missed, you know.
It's over there.
Well, hello, sheep!
Yes.
Miss Earhart has arrived safely, sir.
She's landed in Ireland.
Wonderful.
Wonderful news!
Journey's end.
Here she is, safe and sound on a farm in Ireland having just completed the first flight by a woman across the Atlantic.
And there's the little plane in which she's broken all records.
Well done.
Well done.
Action!
You're on vacation with Amelia Earhart luggage.
Travel the Nile, moonlight...
I'm sorry, I can't say this.
I try to put the freedom that is flying into my clothes!
Eastman Kodak cameras.
Travel the world, save your memories.
The second person to fly the Atlantic solo,
- and the first one to fly it twice.
- Standing room only, good.
Fourteen hours and 54 minutes.
Are you staying for this?
No, I can't.
I gotta meet the features editor at the Post and then organize that photo shoot for the new luggage line.
What's wrong with you today?
Here I am jumping through hoops like a white horse in the circus.
That's what's wrong.
The only way that we can finance your flying is to make enough money to finance your flying.
...Amelia Earhart!
Go on out there.
Thank you!
Thank you very much.
Oh.
Please!
Miss Earhart?
An autograph, please.
Miss Earhart, please.
Miss Earhart?
- What's your name?
- Gore.
That's an unusual name.
I know.
I don't much like it.
We blame his mother.
She was a Gore, roots going back to colonial times.
Hello.
God, do I have to wade through that?
You will have two Vidal men to protect you.
You'll be fine.
You are so much prettier than your pictures.
Well, thank you, but that...
Have you heard from Lindbergh?
What did he say?
"Well done."
Are you gonna write another book?
Yes, if my husband has anything to say about it.
Take my hand.
Come on, Gore.
Let's you and I lead Miss Earhart to safety.
You know, that woman was right.
- Excuse me?
- I felt the same way when I first met you.
You are much prettier than your pictures.
It all seems rather silly considering what's happening out there.
Those men, all those families.
Why have I been given so much?
You've earned the spotlight.
Enjoy it.
You'll be fine.
Just hold on to yourself.
I'm not sure who that is anymore.
She's that girl from Kansas who says "hooey."
Distinguished dignitaries from every corner of the world, please rise and welcome Miss Amelia Earhart, honored guest of President Roosevelt and the League of American Pilots.
I'd like to toast a world-class pilot who, at age 15, became the youngest woman in the world to fly solo.
This year, she's recognized as Woman Pilot of the Year.
Here's to Elinor Smith, an inspiration to us all.
Your husband encourages you to fly across the Atlantic.
My husband wouldn't want me to fly to N Street.
So, he hasn't actually forbidden you?
Franklin doesn't forbid.
He just feels it's a waste of my valuable time to learn since I can't afford to buy a plane.
The wrong Roosevelt got elected.
I did ask about aviation, but he hasn't decided on the structure yet.
It might be under the Bureau of Commerce.
I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it.
I'm sorry, my hearing's failing.
I missed the words "or woman"?
This may be one of those rare instances when the most accomplished candidate turns out to be male.
Is it a name I know?
Gene Vidal.
I love finding the exception that proves the rule.
How do you feel about flying at night?
Whoa!
There we are, ladies and gentlemen, champagne.
Champagne to toast the first lady.
Put your hands on the wheel!
It's dual controls.
No one'll ever know.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to toast to you!
Oh.
Dear God!
Good night.
Well, I shall never, ever forget this night.
She seems quite taken with you.
And vice-versa.
Then again, lots of people are quite taken with you.
If you're referring to Gene, as I know you are,
I was able to get a word in for him, to head the Aeronautics Branch.
How did it go?
It's her husband's decision, but I'm hopeful.
Gene is so fortunate to have you in his corner, Amelia.
He'll help me and I'm helping him.
You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me Why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me
Transcontinental was too ambitious.
Too many hops, too tough on the ladies.
But the shuttle, Washington, New York, Boston, we think it's the future.
Will you go there with us?
What on earth would you need me for?
You're the most famous woman in America, that's what for.
You know, I can see it now.
You on the poster with Gene, a legendary athlete at West Point, two events at the Olympics, a top pilot who's gonna be running the skies for Roosevelt when he wins.
Thanks, Paul.
I think you've even talked me out of it.
Do, do that voodoo that you do so well...
May I ask you a question?
That woman over there.
She's beautiful.
You're the only woman I know who points out other beautiful women.
Lovely legs, unlike mine.
No, I'm sure that's not true.
That's why you wear trousers?
No.
And all this while I thought you just wanted to be one of the boys.
I may have, at one time, but not anymore.
Was that Amelia Earhart?
Sixth floor, please.
Gore!
I couldn't wait for your visit this weekend.
Lewis.
Lewis.
Help!
Tiger, tiger!
Ah.
The wallpaper.
Coming, Gore.
It's okay.
Do you know why I papered this room like this?
No.
But I wish you hadn't.
It's because I'm very, very afraid of jungles.
So, when I find myself worrying about it,
I test my courage by coming into this room and pretending I'm in the deepest, darkest part of Africa.
In a jungle so thick, I can't even see the sky above.
And I start to feel better right away because I looked my fear right in the face.
Miss Earhart?
Yes?
Could you please marry my father?
Then I'll never be afraid of anything ever again.
Aw.
I'm already married to Mr. Putnam.
Why can't you be married to Mr. Putnam and my father?
I put together one month in Europe.
Had to close some foreign licensing deals, open new markets.
When are you leaving?
Well, the thing is, I'd like you to come.
I don't see how I could.
Well, I've already spoken to the promoters.
They're willing to switch some of the lecture dates, just for us.
Well, it's not just that.
There's my work on the shuttle.
I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
Normally I'd be worried about leaving you here alone, but I suppose that won't be a problem, will it?
What are you trying to say?
Gene, here in our house, when I am here, is one thing.
When I am not here,
- I can't have it.
- I understand.
I can't have it.
Hello?
I found something you'd written.
Quite beautiful.
"To touch your hand and see your face today is joy.
"Your casual presence in a room recalls the stars
"that watched us as we lay.
"I mark you in the moving crowd and see again those stars
"a warm night lent us long ago.
"We loved so then, we love so now."
Thank you so much for writing that.
Even though I'd never seen it.
At the time, I...
George?
George.
Thank you.
How are you?
I wondered if you were avoiding me a little or...
Just very, very busy.
I'm leaving for Indiana.
Edward Elliott of Purdue wants me to build a Women's Careers Department there.
That's a wonderful idea, especially now.
What's special about now?
You don't read the papers?
Not unless someone makes me.
Well, someone should.
They're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose other than publicity, meaning money.
They also harp on a growing list of products you commercially endorse.
How thoughtless of me to be doing all this in a society where no one else is interested in making money, present company included.
People viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's sweetheart of the skies, the wife, mother, daughter they all wish they'd had, would be helpful.
Thanks for the tip.
Thanks for not being defensive.
I've decided I'm resigning as your consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
The public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together.
And you, of all people, should know that whatever I do,
I do so that I can fly.
And I want to fly that beautiful bird as far as it will take me.
I'm going to fly around the world, Gene.
It can't be done.
Well, I'm going to try.
And I'm going home.
To George.
You can't mean that.
Race you to New York City.
Well, are you going to tell me your surprise, or do I need to be physical?
Boy, that's exactly what I want.
Come on, G.P., tell me.
If you're serious about this flying-around-the-world nonsense, then it might be handy to have a plane to fly in.
Except it would have to be an Electra, and they cost... $36,000, after a generous discount from Lockheed.
It may as well be a billion.
Not to mention at least another $36,000 to have it modified and ready.
And your surprise is you robbed a bank?
No, actually, a university.
I persuaded Ed Elliott to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue.
I suggested a budget amount of $80,000 for a suitable flying laboratory.
The Electra?
Your Electra, Amelia.
George!
Well, there is one thing.
The trustees and the donors, they have to be on board also.
Well, that's my job.
I'll do a series of lectures...
No, there will be no more horses, no more hoops, for my Amelia.
Thank you, George.
Even if you don't care if she lives or dies, you know her death will not be a plus for aviation women, or your next campaign.
What if she doesn't die?
What if she just circumnavigates the globe and it's a plus for everyone?
The closest land west of Hawaii is beyond the range of the Electra.
She'll refuel in the air.
She doesn't have the flying skills.
She's taking bigger risks.
Yes.
I'm aware of that.
Don't be so proud of it.
I understand the danger, fellas.
I've studied the route.
What have you come up with?
This is Howland Island.
It's halfway between Honolulu and New Guinea.
It has no elevation, no trees, hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.
It would be almost impossible to spot from the air.
It's really tiny, like a grain of sand in a thousand miles of nowhere.
If you miss this island, you're out of fuel with 2,000 miles to go.
But I'll have Fred Noonan, the best celestial navigator around.
In fact, she's taking Fred along for the whole trip.
Giving up my little arrogance about solo.
Safety first, yes?
You've always had Amelia's best interest at heart.
And for that, we're both grateful.
Stay for supper?
I'd like to, but I'd better be getting back.
Please tell Gore hello for me.
Give him this.
He can track the time zones.
He misses you.
He doesn't understand, really.
Is the new gasket up to spec, Jim?
Everything's good, Miss Earhart.
Hello, Fred.
Ma'am.
- Good to see you.
- And you.
Thank you.
Are we sizing me up?
I'm told midair refueling would be beyond my abilities.
You have to put in time, learn the technique.
Even so, 20%, it works, 20%, you crash, 60%, you don't get the fuel, so you're cooked anyway.
Better odds of hitting that island?
How do you feel about 100%?
Even with cloud cover?
Pan Am told you I'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen.
They did.
Someone else told you I got a drinking problem.
Which is a big part of why we're here, right?
Everyone I ever worked for will tell you, nothing's interfered with my performance, not once.
We'd be looking for an island less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet.
That's what you'd be looking for.
I'd be looking for coordinates on a map.
How can I lose?
Amelia Earhart leaves Oakland for Honolulu, setting out on the most dangerous aeronautic feat ever attempted:
to traverse the waistline of the world.
How about a smile for the people back in the States?
Miss Earhart, look this way.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Take care of her, Fred.
That's great.
Thanks.
One big one for the camera, Miss Amelia!
You know, we've got so much fuel we can't possibly get off the ground.
Much safer than flying.
Well, we'll need enough for a third pass at Howland after you miss it the first couple times around.
Good thinking.
Thank you!
One more, please, Miss Earhart.
Right here, Amelia!
Good luck, Fred!
Good luck, Amelia!
Clear!
No!
You all right?
Good reaction cutting the switch!
You saved our ass!
Come on, Fred!
Right engine, get the right engine!
Hose on there, right underneath.
- We need tetrachloride here.
- Pyrene, pyrene.
Sam, make sure you get a picture of that.
Make sure you get a good shot of their faces!
Turn her up.
Okay, go.
I'll make it good, G.P., I swear to you I will.
I'll make it back and more, I promise.
The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three years.
Maybe.
No, it will, I promise.
Our sales, our prices are going to double.
This just showed them how dangerous it all is.
They were taking it for granted.
They thought I was competent.
Here.
I meant, maybe...
Maybe we can just stop it.
You mean after?
Or even now.
So my exit would be a stupid crash and withdrawing from a world-publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before.
It would ruin us in the bargain.
- Mmm-hmm.
Yes.
- We'd have nothing.
Mmm-hmm.
It's true.
And I'd be fine with that.
That's because you're an idiot.
Lucky for you.
And what if it's not something I need to show the world?
What if it's something I need to show me?
I don't really have a choice, I have to reverse the route.
I'd be facing hurricanes in the Caribbean, monsoons in Africa.
Yeah, but you'll be flying Howland last.
- When I'm most tired.
- Yeah.
So, I just won't get tired.
What's the timetable on the plane?
Three weeks.
She'll be good as new.
We have a remarkable crew here.
- The best that money can...
- Money can buy.
...buy, yeah.
All the money wasted that's never coming back.
You cut the engines.
It would've cost a bundle more to replace a burnt-out plane.
Not to mention a burnt-up pilot.
I overreacted.
The plane was too heavy, I should've used more rudder instead of the throttle.
I...
It's only money.
We'll figure this out.
We always do.
Have you considered, Miss Earhart, that your enthusiasm as a pilot outweighs your ability, as demonstrated by the disaster in Honolulu?
People are saying that you're reckless, a better celebrity than pilot.
Enthusiastic?
Yes.
Reckless?
Not on your life.
I'm a flier pursuing my passion for the fun of it, that's all.
Thank you.
A future flier!
You can do it, Amelia!
Mr. Noonan, over here!
Miss Earhart!
We love you, Amelia!
She will fly the world's full circumference, 24,902 miles, to travel across the South Atlantic, crossing Africa, over India, and across the wide Pacific...
After this 'round-the-world flight, Miss Earhart, are you gonna give up long-distance flying?
Not while there's still life left in me.
Always ready for a new adventure.
Great, great.
Fred, you're on.
Hey, Fred, give us a big smile for the camera!
Come back to me.
Always.
Hurry up, come on!
Hurry up!
Miss Earhart!
Just one more picture, please!
Just one more, please!
Miss Earhart, over here!
Miss Earhart!
See you.
A fairyland of beauty lay below and about me so lovely as to distract a pilot's attention from the task at hand, that of herding a heavy plane out of that great upland saucer and over the mountains that make its rim.
What is this thing, huh?
Whole thing's made of mud.
It's beautiful.
It's like working with you.
Come on, Amelia.
Amelia Earhart has reached Calcutta...
Dad!
Dad!
It's a bulletin!
...but heavy rains have temporarily grounded her.
She will push on to Bangkok, then Papua New Guinea before heading east toward her final destination, California.
We should go, Fred.
Oh, come on!
You're not really taking off?
It's only going to get heavier.
We could be stuck here for days, even weeks.
It's only 700 miles to Bangkok, it's lighter there.
To get that far in a monsoon, you'd need divine help!
Chai?
Thank you.
Come on, Fred.
You think we should turn back, huh?
Nope.
I think we shouldn't have come.
Hi, Joan.
Hello, Frances.
You look beat, lady.
That's funny, you look tip-top.
Why don't you grab a few hours of sleep?
Might as well keep you company.
I've got some good flying stories.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You and your old George.
That's a touching love story.
An honest one, if I say so myself.
I wonder if it's honest enough for George.
If you mean Gene, we're not together anymore.
In that way.
Not for a long time.
You don't think I love my husband?
Actually, I do.
In a certain way.
But you disapprove of how I live?
Hell, no.
It's just like me.
In fact, it's like most guys I know.
Meaning?
Guys love their wives, their girlfriends.
Doesn't mean they don't take advantage of an opportunity.
If you have a point, make it.
I believe I have.
All you need to do is just show up tomorrow morning, show up sober, and get me to Howland Island.
Ready, ma'am.
Thank you.
Feel like stepping out for a smoke?
Oh, I don't smoke.
Or something?
Earhart here.
Putnam here.
You should be sleeping.
You should be working.
I'm running a big adventure here.
I'm a very important fellow.
You told me I was the star and you'd be nearby, a small particle of dust in my constellation.
I thought I was joking.
Guess the joke's on me.
I'll be in Honolulu on the third and with you in Oakland on the Fourth of July, okay?
Don't keep me waiting.
I won't dare.
How's Fred?
On the wagon?
I sent you my movies to lighten the plane.
You wouldn't sell a salesman, would you?
Fred is fine.
He's calculating headwind speed versus fuel as we speak.
So what's that I hear in your voice?
Is he drinking?
I can handle it.
All right, call it off.
Call it off now.
Right now, Amelia.
I mean it.
Right now.
I can handle it.
After the Fourth, we're going home.
Where is that?
For me?
Anywhere you are.
I'm going to like it there.
I'd better, since this is going to be my last flight.
If you insist.
I love you.
Should I let you go now?
No, never.
I'll go tell the world you're on your way.
See you, my darling.
See you, my love.
It looks like she's ready to leave.
Might be easier to just shoot me.
Traveling light, is all.
You got room for 180 pounds of asshole?
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
It's fine.
Everything is.
- Have you filled the other side?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not more than a month ago, I was on the other shore of the Pacific, looking westward.
This morning, I look eastward over the Pacific.
In these fast-moving days that have intervened, the whole width of the world has passed behind us except this broad ocean.
I shall be glad when we have the hazards of this navigation behind us.
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.
Mr. Putnam.
The headwinds were stronger than they knew when they took off.
I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them nine percent.
Nine percent.
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?
Mr. Putnam, I can't reach them, sir.
I tried voice and Morse Code.
No, forget Morse Code.
They didn't take the receiver.
Just stay with voice.
You'll get them.
At ease, sailor.
The direction finder.
How long has this been left on?
The battery's dead.
Itasca, this is Earhart.
We're about 200 miles out.
Sky overcast.
Over.
That's her, on 3105.
She said "cloudy and overcast."
Itasca, this is Earhart.
Sky overcast.
Over.
We are receiving your signal.
Please acknowledge ours.
What is your position and ETA Howland?
Over.
Itasca, this is Earhart.
Unable to hear you, over.
Earhart, this is Itasca.
Did you receive transmission?
King How Able Queen Queen.
Please acknowledge our signals on key.
Please acknowledge.

Earhart's signal strength 4.
Please take bearing on us and report in half an hour.
We'll make noise in microphone.
We are about 100 miles out.
Over.
She's got to stay on longer.
On air too briefly, bearing's impossible.
Maybe her Morse receiver's out.
King How Able Queen Queen.
This is Itasca.
Can't take bearing on 3105.
Please send on 500.
Or do you want to take bearing on us?
Over.
Intercom top deck.
Double-check the smoke stack.
O'Hare to top deck.
Top deck, come in.
They should be able to see that for 20 miles at least.
Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen.
We must be on you, but cannot see you.

Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen.
We received your signal, but unable to take bearing.
Please take bearing on us and answer on 3105 with voice.
Over.
Your signal received okay.
It is impossible to take a bearing on 3105 on your voice.
Send us a longer transmission, please.
Over.
A report has come in from the ship for Mr. Putnam.
Oh, God.
Miss Earhart has finally received transmission from Itasca.
Keep us at 7500.
That's her only acknowledgment.
You've got her signal, damn it.
What about the direction finder?
Cipriani reports the battery's dead, sir.
It was left on all night, so we can't track her.
King How Able Queen Queen to Itasca.
Earhart, will you please come in and reply on 500?
We are transmitting constantly on 7500 and we cannot hear you on 500.
Despite constant attempts, the USS Itasca has lost contact with Amelia Earhart.
Come on.
Come on.
King How Able Queen Queen to Itasca.
We are on the position line 157-337.
We are running north and south.
Over.
We hear you.
We hear you.
Are you receiving us?
Earhart, this is Itasca.
Did you receive transmission?
Itasca to Earhart, come in, please.
All the things I never said for so very long, look up, they're in my eyes.
Everyone has oceans to fly.
As long as you have the heart to do it.
Is it reckless?
Maybe.
But what do dreams know of boundaries?
I think about the hands I have held,
the places I've seen,
the vast lands whose dirt is caked on the bottom of my shoes.
The world has changed me.
Engine 2 looks fine.
How's number 1?
Did a compression check.
Engine 1 looks fine.
We love you, Amelia!
Good luck, Amelia!
Miss Earhart, do you really think you'll break the record this time?
She will fly the world's full circumference, 24,902 miles, to travel across the South Atlantic, crossing Africa, over India...
After this 'round-the-world flight, Miss Earhart, are you gonna give up long-distance flying?
Not while there's still life left in me.
I fly for the fun of it.
Good luck!
All right, give us a big smile!
We love you, Amelia!
Thank you.
That's enough.
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.
Mr. Putnam.
The headwinds were stronger than they knew when they took off.
I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them 9%.
9%.
When I saw that little plane, it lifted me above the Kansas prairie.
I had to fly.
My daddy had the wanderlust.
That's why I like to keep moving.
Flying lets me move in 3 dimensions.
Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?
Miss Earhart?
Mr. Putnam will see you now.
Send the papers over this afternoon.
Thank you, bye.
-Miss Earhart?
-Mr.
Putnam?
Please, sit.
I'm told you want to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.
-I do.
-Why do you want to fly?
-Why?
-Why do you want to fly?
Why does a man ride a horse?
Because he wants to, I guess.
3 women have died trying.
2 others have escaped with their lives.
If you do make it, you will be the first, which is the real attraction for both of us, I expect.
Always nice to know what the real attraction is.
The plane was bought from Admiral Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite, who's asked to find an American.
Educated, well-spoken, a flier and preferably physically attractive.
Why would that matter?
Because she wants the world to pay attention.
And pretty girls command more attention.
Was that your advice?
There'll be a contract for the girl's story with The New York Times.
Also a book to be published under her name.
But all the money from this will go to Mrs. Guest.
Except for the part that goes to you.
Well, this is America, and therefore I am obligated to make as much money as I can.
You have a wonderful laugh, Miss Earhart.
You said she wants a flier.
Don't get your hopes up.
The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be pilot.
There will be a male co-pilot who will also serve as navigator.
The woman will be purely a passenger.
Take Lindbergh.
I published his book 3 months after his historic flight.
Must be wonderful to actually know him, to be a friend of his.
Friend?
Good God, no.
Can't stand the man.
He's a stiff-ass, sanctimonious, boring prude.
Was a bestseller though.
Why would anyone want to read a book written by a passenger?
Because the hook is that they're gonna make the woman commander.
The pilot will sign a contract saying he's under your direction and control.
It would be your flight.
My fraud, you mean.
A very distasteful word in book publishing, Miss Earhart.
I don't know, Mr. Putnam.
My dream has always been to fly across the Atlantic, but the way you want me to do it is far from the way I've envisioned it.
Let me be frank.
With your level of flight experience, I wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would normally be considered for this, if a woman were to do any flying at all.
Miss Earhart, let me be painfully clear,
I give the orders and you take them.
And if you do as you're told, you'll be a star.
And I will be nearby, a small particle of dust in your constellation.
Spoken like a gentleman.
Miss Earhart.
Mr. Putnam.
Of course, a gentleman would've paid for my ticket.
What the hell are they?
Oryx!
Look how free they are!
No constraints, no schedules to keep.
For a gal who don't like schedules, you sure got yourself hooked up with the wrong fella in Mr. Putnam.
Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.
Say hello to Slim Gordon, your navigator.
How do you do?
And Bill Stultz,
-the best pilot working today.
-Hello, Bill.
How much fuel do you lose because of these?
Costs us at least 400 gallons.
Well, then why have them?
The owner wants to protect her plane in case you have to ditch it at sea.
But those are decisions I have to make, not somebody else.
They're not making this trip, we are.
But she owns the plane, and this is still America, Miss Earhart.
Ownership is the trump card.
Sad to say, but dollars put planes in the air.
I wonder if it can keep us up there, not that I've ever had enough to try.
Our job is to figure out how to fly this beauty without gasoline.
Include the whole engine up here.
The name is Amelia Earhart.
Careful up there, Slim.
They're leaving for Newfoundland.
Yes, they'll be taking off for there tomorrow, weather permitting.
Make sure the reporters are there.
Goodbye.
Popping-off letters.
For my dad, my mom, and my sis.
You know, in case.
I'm honored that you would leave these with me.
Who else?
If I do pop off, it's your fault.
Pray I make it.
Not much of a prayer man.
Then at least tip your hat and cross your fingers.
Well,
-see you.
-See you.
It's a short hop from Boston to Newfoundland for Amelia Earhart and crew.
Then on to Ireland, and possibly the record books.
Earhart and top-notch ace Bill Stultz have to get airborne, quite a feat once their plane is fully loaded for the Atlantic crossing.
Seems like we got a situation here, a real problem.
When you figure it out, Commander, let us know.
I don't even know what the hell I'm saying anymore.
Here's to Little Miss Earhart, who couldn't lift a pigeon off the ground!
What time is it?
It's time to fly.
Get up, get dressed, we're going now.
Where's the weather report?
It's not good enough.
Great.
Either we fly to Ireland or you're going home today.
Well, it's not good enough.
It's fine.
There's a tailwind all the way.
We'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind will get us to Ireland.
You're dumping fuel?
You're serious?
Just as serious as you're hung-over.
Slim, you go now.
Get the late weather.
We'll meet you at the plane.
Slim, go.
I've got this.
I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill.
He's the most caring and generous and charming and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know.
He's my father.
He's a drunk, and he's let me down all my life.
Now you get out of that goddamn bed, and you fly that plane to Ireland, or I swear to you, I will.
Good.
Slim, start the engines.
This report indicates some degree of risk.
It's a risk I'm taking.
Have a nice flight.
Read tomorrow's papers, Bill!
We'll both be in them.
So, to take off, you pull back on the thing, right?
Go get 'em, Amelia!
Start the clock!
Let's hope this works!
We're up.
We're up.
We're up!
-Good work!
-Well done, Commander!
The fog comes on little cat feet.
It sits, looking over harbor and city, on silent haunches and then moves on.
Listen.
The motors are humming sweetly.
And I feel at home.
You okay?
Be better off if the damn radio would join the party!
Mr. Putnam!
There's a call coming in.
Putnam.
I'm afraid we've lost contact with Miss Earhart's plane, sir.
Keep me informed.
Thank you.
We've been flying for 19 hours plus.
How far to land?
Radio is still out.
There's no way to compute wind speed and drift in the clouds, so God only knows where Ireland is.
There may be an hour of gasoline left.
Probably less.
If we land on the water now, we might have a rescue.
And a failure!
That's out.
Hold on to something, for Christ's sake!
Slim, go help her.
Hang on!
Okay, I'm coming.
Hold on.
Got it.
Take my hand.
-Hang on, Slim!
-Help!
You boys all right?
God!
Land.
Land.
Look.
We got land!
We did it!
We're alive!
Nice work!
Amazing!
Glory, hallelujah!
We made it!
Hello!
-Hello there!
-Hello, young lady!
-Fine young fella.
-Hello!
Hello there, gentlemen.
Hello!
What do you make of that?
Hurry up with it.
You're going to miss it.
Hurry up, man!
Welcome, Miss Earhart!
Miss Earhart!
Morgan, be careful.
That's precious cargo!
There you go, lovely lady.
Watch your step.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Is it Irish tradition to greet newcomers with song?
I couldn't say.
This is Wales!
Bill, look!
Hello, Dorothy.
Are you going to be the next girls to become pilots?
What?
It feels strange.
We haven't had a moment alone.
Just the 2 of us.
Miss Earhart, do you have a statement for the Times?
We're so proud of you!
We love you, Amelia!
Amelia!
Not in the rain!
I flew across the Atlantic!
Hold it right there.
Now, this is a list of the shots they want.
Do you have dirt on your face?
I believe you are referring to my freckles.
-They come with the skin.
-I don't like them.
Very heroic.
Think Lindbergh.
Lady Lindy.
That's what they'll call you.
As I look back on the flight,
I think of 2 questions that have been asked me most frequently:
"Where are you going next?"
and "What did you wear?"
Lucky Strike endorsement.
I wrote the copy myself.
What does it say?
"I don't smoke, but you should"?
No, it says that Lucky Strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship.
Which is true.
I hid them under the seat.
True, maybe, but misleading.
Why would I sign that?
So that Bill and Slim get paid.
Amelia Earhart, the only woman to fly across the Atlantic, just can't keep her feet on the ground.
The publisher George Putnam has commissioned her to write a book on her flying adventures.
-Thanks, fellas!
-You're welcome, Miss Earhart.
You didn't have to come get me.
You do have a dress to change into, I hope.
-Well, it's just a college class, George.
-No, no, no.
No.
You have to take every appearance seriously.
You never know what it might lead to.
Spoken by a man who should know.
What was that for?
Good luck?
What happened to tipping your hat and crossing your fingers?
I'm afraid I'm way beyond that now, like it or not.
I think I like it.
What did your mother say when she knew you flew across the Atlantic?
Well, she sent a telegram congratulating me and then she said the next time she wants to sit beside me in the cockpit.
How did it feel to fly over the ocean?
Were you scared?
When I looked down at the sea, it seemed much like the sky to me.
As if the sky and the sea were the same.
I felt much as I do when I'm flying upward toward the sun.
Transported somehow to a simple, safe, beautiful place, where everything is comprehensible.
Welcome to the Chicago Congress Plaza Hotel.
Good night, Amelia.
Good night.
(MOONGLOW)
It must have been moonglow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow
That led me straight to you
I still hear you...
Dance with me, George.
And I keep on praying
"Oh, Lord, please let this last"
We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs
Seemed to come from everywhere
And now when there's moonglow
Way up in the blue
I'll always remember
That moonglow gave me you
Hello, Elinor.
Mr. Putnam.
Yes, please come in.
Amelia.
Miss Smith.
I've been following your career with a great deal of admiration.
Miss Earhart, you are such an inspiration.
I never get tired of reading about you.
They're saying you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit.
-On a good week.
-On a bad week.
Depends on whether you want the real or the sell.
I don't underestimate the value of selling.
A 16-year-old girl makes headlines illegally flying under the 4 bridges of the East River.
You don't seem to need much help selling yourself.
Actually, Mr. Putnam,
I was hoping you could do to me what you've done to her.
What's your primary ambition?
To take Amelia's place as the number 1 female pilot.
-You want a tip?
-I do.
If I listened to everyone who said it was impossible,
I'd never be flying.
Don't let anyone turn you around.
-You're all here.
-Thank you.
So lovely to see you.
-Hello.
-Good evening.
Good evening, Miss Earhart.
Marvelous party.
Amelia.
This is Gene Vidal.
Amelia Earhart, the aviatrix.
She's a friend of George's.
How do you do, Miss Earhart?
Quite well, Mr. Vidal.
Thank you.
I understand you're writing a book about your transatlantic journey under the tutelage of the master.
Yes.
You enjoying your stay here in Rye?
I must say, I'm a bit out of my element.
The distance between this world and where I come from is as great as the distance between the sun and the moon.
And you believe the whole "opposites attract" theory is...
Pure hooey.
Pure hooey.
-Where are you from?
-Kansas.
"Hooey" is a Kansas word?
Yes, I suppose it is.
Public relations.
It's a new field, entirely new.
It's not publicity, not promotion.
Miss Earhart.
May I call you Amelia?
We may be from different worlds, but we have more in common than you might imagine.
-Is that so?
-Yes.
I'm a teacher, at West Point, true, but still a teacher.
What do you teach?
Flying.
Listen, Amelia...
This is the first time I've ever seen you stumped for a word.
What is it?
Marry me.
-What?
-I want you to marry me.
I don't want to get married, George.
I'm not the marrying kind.
Don't you see you and I embarking on a new life?
Dear George.
Only I can make a fulfilling life for myself.
I don't believe that one can have a fulfilled life alone.
Only when it's shared.
Let me share your life with you.
Let me try to give you whatever you want.
When I was a little girl, for my 7th birthday
my father gave me a globe.
And I'd spend hours just spinning it slowly, reading the names of all those strange, faraway places.
Morocco.
Spain.
Ethiopia.
Dreaming that someday I would go to those places, like a wayfarer,
a traveler, a vagabond.
I want to be free, George.
To be a vagabond of the air.
I'll help you get there.
Thanks.
Hello!
Give me the camera.
I am on my shining adventure, flying the world.
No borders, just horizons.
Only freedom.
Dear G.P.,
You must know again my reluctance to marry, my feeling that I shatter thereby my life in flying, which means so much to me.
In this connection, I may have to keep some place where I can go to be myself now and then, for I cannot guarantee to endure at all the confinements of even an attractive cage.
"In our life together,
"I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me
"nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.
"I must exact a cruel promise.
"And that is, you will let me go in a year
"if we find no happiness together."
Only you, my dear Amelia, could say those brutal words to me
and still have me wanting to be with you.
Forever.
Amelia, do you promise to love, honor and obey this man...
Excuse me, sir?
May we take that back a bit, please?
Love, yes, if it's warranted.
Honor, same thing.
Obey, I can't promise that under any circumstances, but the groom understands that.
Please remove "obey" from the prayer so we can wrap this up before the bride runs off.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Announcing the first Women's Air Derby, racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland.
Yeah, that's fine.
What's this we're hearing?
Advance press release.
The gentlemen who are running the Derby are about to announce the race has to end west of the Rockies.
What?
That's absurd, they're cutting out half the route.
What are they thinking?
They're thinking that it would be bad press when you girls start smashing into the Rocky Mountains.
How dare they?
I'm gonna have a word with these gentlemen.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no.
Come here and walk with me.
I think it would benefit women fliers everywhere if Amelia won the Derby.
You know, the publicity would put the race and all of you up there with the boys.
Well, maybe I'll win the race myself.
Well, you can't win if your plane doesn't pass the final inspection.
And let me predict that it won't.
-Well, that's a threat.
-No.
A prediction.
Amelia's the one who said I shouldn't let anybody turn me around.
Yeah, she probably meant me.
Well, obviously she doesn't see me as a threat.
Sure, she does.
She just doesn't care.
Hey, Gladys!
I let the boys in charge know, in no uncertain terms, we're not changing our route!
We'll sail over those mountains like we're eagles.
I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor.
This is what my loyalty requires.
Lady Lindy herself, Amelia Earhart!
Clear!
Amelia Earhart organizes a competition for women pilots.
9 cities in 9 days.
Tragedy strikes, and there are crashes along the way.
The race continues.
Thousands plan to be on hand to witness those who make it as they approach the finish line.
Here they come, folks.
In 1st place, Louise Haden from Bentonville, Arkansas!
In 2nd place, Gladys O'Donnell from Long Beach, California.
3rd place goes to Amelia Earhart, Atchison, Kansas!
How does it feel to finish 3rd?
A victory for any woman flier is a victory for me.
I'd like to add my congratulations to Louise Haden and announce that we have formed an organization to promote women in aviation.
99 women pilots have applied, so we're calling it The 99s.
And we're going to fly forever!
-George?
-Mom?
-I've been thinking.
-Yes?
I want to fly the Atlantic.
You already have.
As a passenger.
It doesn't count.
I want to fly it solo.
It's been 5 years since Lindbergh.
No one has made it solo.
14 have died trying.
I'll make it.
I know I will.
And if you don't?
I'd rather face a watery grave than go on living as a fraud.
What's wrong with that?
I've been very successful at it.
Amelia Earhart demonstrates her flying prowess and adventurous spirit.
And now she is set to climb to new heights on her 2nd attempt to cross the Atlantic.
No more a passenger, this time Miss Earhart will do it alone.
Still sleepy?
Well, I'll nap on the way.
Good news about flying solo, no one making noise.
Do you have money?
No.
A whole 20?
I spent our money on ocean liner passage.
Going to bring you back.
It's non-refundable.
Please do your part.
I will.
Well, see you.
Please clear the runway for takeoff.
See you.
Presently all clear over the Atlantic, keeping an eye on a storm system south of the route.
It was a night of stars, of tropic loveliness.
Stars hung outside my cockpit window near enough to touch.
If Lindbergh did it, you can do it.
No sign of Miss Earhart yet, Mr. Putnam, sir.
If she's on course, the moon should be with her the rest of the way.
Weather updates are coming in every quarter-hour from Kemble.
Le Bourget Airport, France.
A galaxy of press, well-wishers and ambassadors alike has gathered here in Paris in anticipation of the historic moment when Amelia Earhart will touch down where Lindbergh did years ago.
The world waits with bated breath as Amelia flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
-Jimmy, look at that there.
-What do you see?
Excuse me, sir.
Where am I?
In Gallagher's pasture.
Where are you supposed to be?
When I left, I was aiming for Paris.
You missed, you know.
It's over there.
Well, hello, sheep!
Yes.
Miss Earhart has arrived safely, sir.
She's landed in Ireland.
Wonderful.
Wonderful news!
Journey's end.
Here she is, safe and sound on a farm in Ireland having just completed the first flight by a woman across the Atlantic.
And there's the little plane in which she's broken all records.
Well done.
Well done.
Action!
You're on vacation with Amelia Earhart luggage.
Travel the Nile, moonlight...
I'm sorry, I can't say this.
I try to put the freedom that is flying into my clothes!
Eastman Kodak cameras.
Travel the world, save your memories.
The 2nd person to fly the Atlantic solo,
-and the first one to fly it twice.
-Standing room only, good.
14 hours and 54 minutes.
Are you staying for this?
No, I can't.
I gotta meet the features editor at the Post and then organize that photo shoot for the new luggage line.
What's wrong with you today?
Here I am jumping through hoops like a white horse in the circus.
That's what's wrong.
The only way that we can finance your flying is to make enough money to finance your flying.
...Amelia Earhart!
Go on out there.
Thank you!
Thank you very much.
Please!
Miss Earhart?
An autograph, please.
Miss Earhart, please.
Miss Earhart?
-What's your name?
-Gore.
That's an unusual name.
I know.
I don't much like it.
We blame his mother.
She was a Gore, roots going back to colonial times.
Hello.
God, do I have to wade through that?
You will have 2 Vidal men to protect you.
You'll be fine.
You are so much prettier than your pictures.
Well, thank you, but that...
Have you heard from Lindbergh?
What did he say?
"Well done."
Are you gonna write another book?
Yes, if my husband has anything to say about it.
Take my hand.
Come on, Gore.
Let's you and I lead Miss Earhart to safety.
You know, that woman was right.
-Excuse me?
-I felt the same way when I first met you.
You are much prettier than your pictures.
It all seems rather silly considering what's happening out there.
Those men, all those families.
Why have I been given so much?
You've earned the spotlight.
Enjoy it.
You'll be fine.
Just hold on to yourself.
I'm not sure who that is anymore.
She's that girl from Kansas who says "hooey."
Distinguished dignitaries from every corner of the world, please rise and welcome Miss Amelia Earhart, honored guest of President Roosevelt and the League of American Pilots.
I'd like to toast a world-class pilot who, at age 15, became the youngest woman in the world to fly solo.
This year, she's recognized as Woman Pilot of the Year.
Here's to Elinor Smith, an inspiration to us all.
Your husband encourages you to fly across the Atlantic.
My husband wouldn't want me to fly to N Street.
So, he hasn't actually forbidden you?
Franklin doesn't forbid.
He just feels it's a waste of my valuable time to learn since I can't afford to buy a plane.
The wrong Roosevelt got elected.
I did ask about aviation, but he hasn't decided on the structure yet.
It might be under the Bureau of Commerce.
I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it.
I'm sorry, my hearing's failing.
I missed the words "or woman"?
This may be one of those rare instances when the most accomplished candidate turns out to be male.
Is it a name I know?
Gene Vidal.
I love finding the exception that proves the rule.
How do you feel about flying at night?
There we are, ladies and gentlemen, champagne.
Champagne to toast the first lady.
Put your hands on the wheel!
It's dual controls.
No one'll ever know.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to toast to you!
Dear God!
Good night.
Well, I shall never, ever forget this night.
She seems quite taken with you.
And vice-versa.
Then again, lots of people are quite taken with you.
If you're referring to Gene, as I know you are,
I was able to get a word in for him, to head the Aeronautics Branch.
How did it go?
It's her husband's decision, but I'm hopeful.
Gene is so fortunate to have you in his corner, Amelia.
He'll help me and I'm helping him.
(YOU DO SOMETHING TO ME)
You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me Why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me
Transcontinental was too ambitious.
Too many hops, too tough on the ladies.
But the shuttle, Washington, New York, Boston, we think it's the future.
Will you go there with us?
What on earth would you need me for?
You're the most famous woman in America, that's what for.
You know, I can see it now.
You on the poster with Gene, a legendary athlete at West Point,
2 events at the Olympics, a top pilot who's gonna be running the skies for Roosevelt when he wins.
Thanks, Paul.
I think you've even talked me out of it.
Do, do that voodoo that you do so well...
May I ask you a question?
May I ask you a question?
That woman over there.
She's beautiful.
You're the only woman I know who points out other beautiful women.
Lovely legs, unlike mine.
No, I'm sure that's not true.
That's why you wear trousers?
No.
And all this while I thought you just wanted to be one of the boys.
I may have, at one time, but not anymore.
Was that Amelia Earhart?
6th floor, please.
Gore!
I couldn't wait for your visit this weekend.
Lewis.
Lewis.
Help!
Tiger, tiger!
The wallpaper.
Coming, Gore.
It's okay.
Do you know why I papered this room like this?
No.
But I wish you hadn't.
It's because I'm very, very afraid of jungles.
So, when I find myself worrying about it,
I test my courage by coming into this room and pretending I'm in the deepest, darkest part of Africa.
In a jungle so thick, I can 't even see the sky above.
And I start to feel better right away because I looked my fear right in the face.
Miss Earhart?
Yes?
Could you please marry my father?
Then I'll never be afraid of anything ever again.
Aw.
I'm already married to Mr. Putnam.
Why can't you be married to Mr. Putnam and my father?
I put together one month in Europe.
Had to close some foreign licensing deals, open new markets.
When are you leaving?
Well, the thing is, I'd like you to come.
I don't see how I could.
Well, I've already spoken to the promoters.
They're willing to switch some of the lecture dates, just for us.
Well, it's not just that.
There's my work on the shuttle.
I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
Normally I'd be worried about leaving you here alone, but I suppose that won't be a problem, will it?
What are you trying to say?
Gene, here in our house, when I am here, is one thing.
When I am not here,
-I can't have it.
-I understand.
I can't have it.
Hello?
I found something you'd written.
Quite beautiful.
"To touch your hand and see your face today is joy.
"Your casual presence in a room recalls the stars
"that watched us as we lay.
"I mark you in the moving crowd and see again those stars
"a warm night lent us long ago.
"We loved so then, we love so now."
Thank you so much for writing that.
Even though I'd never seen it.
At the time, I...
George?
George.
Thank you.
How are you?
I wondered if you were avoiding me a little or...
Just very, very busy.
I'm leaving for Indiana.
Edward Elliott of Purdue wants me to build a Women's Careers Department there.
That's a wonderful idea, especially now.
What's special about now?
You don't read the papers?
Not unless someone makes me.
Well, someone should.
They're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose other than publicity, meaning money.
They also harp on a growing list of products you commercially endorse.
How thoughtless of me to be doing all this in a society where no one else is interested in making money, present company included.
People viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's sweetheart of the skies, the wife, mother, daughter they all wish they'd had, would be helpful.
Thanks for the tip.
Thanks for not being defensive.
I've decided I'm resigning as your consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
The public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together.
And you, of all people, should know that whatever I do,
I do so that I can fly.
And I want to fly that beautiful bird as far as it will take me.
I'm going to fly around the world, Gene.
It can't be done.
Well, I'm going to try.
And I'm going home.
To George.
You can't mean that.
Race you to New York City.
Well, are you going to tell me your surprise, or do I need to be physical?
Boy, that's exactly what I want.
Come on, G.P., tell me.
If you're serious about this flying-around-the-world nonsense, then it might be handy to have a plane to fly in.
Except it would have to be an Electra, and they cost... $36,000, after a generous discount from Lockheed.
It may as well be a billion.
Not to mention at least another $36,000 to have it modified and ready.
And your surprise is you robbed a bank?
No, actually, a university.
I persuaded Ed Elliott to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue.
I suggested a budget amount of $80,000 for a suitable flying laboratory.
The Electra?
Your Electra, Amelia.
George!
Well, there is one thing.
The trustees and the donors, they have to be on board also.
Well, that's my job.
I'll do a series of lectures...
No, there will be no more horses, no more hoops, for my Amelia.
Thank you, George.
Even if you don't care if she lives or dies, you know her death will not be a plus for aviation women, or your next campaign.
What if she doesn't die?
What if she just circumnavigates the globe and it's a plus for everyone?
The closest land west of Hawaii is beyond the range of the Electra.
She'll refuel in the air.
She doesn't have the flying skills.
She's taking bigger risks.
Yes.
I'm aware of that.
Don't be so proud of it.
I understand the danger, fellas.
I've studied the route.
What have you come up with?
This is Howland Island.
It's halfway between Honolulu and New Guinea.
It has no elevation, no trees, hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.
It would be almost impossible to spot from the air.
It's really tiny, like a grain of sand in a thousand miles of nowhere.
If you miss this island, you're out of fuel with 2,000 miles to go.
But I'll have Fred Noonan, the best celestial navigator around.
In fact, she's taking Fred along for the whole trip.
Giving up my little arrogance about solo.
Safety first, yes?
You've always had Amelia's best interest at heart.
And for that, we're both grateful.
Stay for supper?
I'd like to, but I'd better be getting back.
Please tell Gore hello for me.
Give him this.
He can track the time zones.
He misses you.
He doesn't understand, really.
Is the new gasket up to spec, Jim?
Everything's good, Miss Earhart.
Hello, Fred.
Ma'am.
-Good to see you.
-And you.
Thank you.
Are we sizing me up?
I'm told midair refueling would be beyond my abilities.
You have to put in time, learn the technique.
Even so, 20%, it works, 20%, you crash, 60%, you don't get the fuel, so you're cooked anyway.
Better odds of hitting that island?
How do you feel about 100%?
Even with cloud cover?
Pan Am told you I'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen.
They did.
Someone else told you I got a drinking problem.
Which is a big part of why we're here, right?
Everyone I ever worked for will tell you, nothing's interfered with my performance, not once.
We'd be looking for an island less than 2 miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet.
That's what you'd be looking for.
I'd be looking for coordinates on a map.
How can I lose?
Amelia Earhart leaves Oakland for Honolulu, setting out on the most dangerous aeronautic feat ever attempted:
to traverse the waistline of the world.
How about a smile for the people back in the States?
Miss Earhart, look this way.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Take care of her, Fred.
That's great.
Thanks.
One big 1 for the camera, Miss Amelia!
You know, we've got so much fuel we can't possibly get off the ground.
Much safer than flying.
Well, we'll need enough for a 3rd pass at Howland after you miss it the first couple times around.
Good thinking.
Thank you!
One more, please, Miss Earhart.
Right here, Amelia!
Good luck, Fred!
Good luck, Amelia!
Clear!
No!
You all right?
Good reaction cutting the switch!
You saved our ass!
Come on, Fred!
Right engine, get the right engine!
Hose on there, right underneath.
-We need tetrachloride here.
-Pyrene, pyrene.
Sam, make sure you get a picture of that.
Make sure you get a good shot of their faces!
Turn her up.
Okay, go.
I'll make it good, G.P., I swear to you I will.
I'll make it back and more, I promise.
The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another 3 years.
Maybe.
No, it will, I promise.
Our sales, our prices are going to double.
This just showed them how dangerous it all is.
They were taking it for granted.
They thought I was competent.
Here.
I meant, maybe...
Maybe we can just stop it.
You mean after?
Or even now.
So my exit would be a stupid crash and withdrawing from a world-publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before.
It would ruin us in the bargain.
-Yes.
-We'd have nothing.
It's true.
And I'd be fine with that.
That's because you're an idiot.
Lucky for you.
And what if it's not something I need to show the world?
What if it's something I need to show me?
I don't really have a choice, I have to reverse the route.
I'd be facing hurricanes in the Caribbean, monsoons in Africa.
Yeah, but you'll be flying Howland last.
-When I'm most tired.
-Yeah.
So, I just won't get tired.
What's the timetable on the plane?
3 weeks.
She'll be good as new.
We have a remarkable crew here.
-The best that money can...
-Money can buy.
buy, yeah.
All the money wasted that's never coming back.
You cut the engines.
It would've cost a bundle more to replace a burnt-out plane.
Not to mention a burnt-up pilot.
I overreacted.
The plane was too heavy, I should've used more rudder instead of the throttle.
I...
It's only money.
We'll figure this out.
We always do.
Have you considered, Miss Earhart, that your enthusiasm as a pilot outweighs your ability, as demonstrated by the disaster in Honolulu?
People are saying that you're reckless, a better celebrity than pilot.
Enthusiastic?
Yes.
Reckless?
Not on your life.
I'm a flier pursuing my passion for the fun of it, that's all.
Thank you.
A future flier!
You can do it, Amelia!
Mr. Noonan, over here!
Miss Earhart!
We love you, Amelia!
She will fly the world's full circumference, 24,902 miles, to travel across the South Atlantic, crossing Africa, over India, and across the wide Pacific...
After this 'round-the-world flight, Miss Earhart, are you gonna give up long-distance flying?
Not while there's still life left in me.
Always ready for a new adventure.
Great, great.
Fred, you're on.
Hey, Fred, give us a big smile for the camera!
Come back to me.
Always.
Hurry up, come on!
Hurry up!
Miss Earhart!
Just one more picture, please!
Just one more, please!
Miss Earhart, over here!
Miss Earhart!
See you.
A fairyland of beauty lay below and about me so lovely as to distract a pilot's attention from the task at hand, that of herding a heavy plane out of that great upland saucer and over the mountains that make its rim.
What is this thing?
Whole thing's made of mud.
It's beautiful.
It's like working with you.
Come on, Amelia.
Amelia Earhart has reached Calcutta...
Dad!
Dad!
It's a bulletin!
but heavy rains have temporarily grounded her.
She will push on to Bangkok, then Papua New Guinea before heading east toward her final destination, California.
We should go, Fred.
Come on!
You're not really taking off?
It's only going to get heavier.
We could be stuck here for days, even weeks.
It's only 700 miles to Bangkok, it's lighter there.
To get that far in a monsoon, you'd need divine help!
Chai?
Thank you.
Come on, Fred.
You think we should turn back?
Nope.
I think we shouldn't have come.
Hi, Joan.
Hello, Frances.
You look beat, lady.
That's funny, you look tip-top.
Why don't you grab a few hours of sleep?
Might as well keep you company.
I've got some good flying stories.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You and your old George.
That's a touching love story.
An honest one, if I say so myself.
I wonder if it's honest enough for George.
If you mean Gene, we're not together anymore.
In that way.
Not for a long time.
You don't think I love my husband?
Actually, I do.
In a certain way.
But you disapprove of how I live?
Hell, no.
It's just like me.
In fact, it's like most guys I know.
Meaning?
Guys love their wives, their girlfriends.
Doesn't mean they don't take advantage of an opportunity.
If you have a point, make it.
I believe I have.
All you need to do is just show up tomorrow morning, show up sober, and get me to Howland Island.
Ready, ma'am.
Thank you.
Feel like stepping out for a smoke?
I don't smoke.
Or something?
Earhart here.
Putnam here.
You should be sleeping.
You should be working.
I'm running a big adventure here.
I'm a very important fellow.
You told me I was the star and you'd be nearby, a small particle of dust in my constellation.
I thought I was joking.
Guess the joke's on me.
I'll be in Honolulu on the 3rd and with you in Oakland on the 4th of July, okay?
Don't keep me waiting.
I won't dare.
How's Fred?
On the wagon?
I sent you my movies to lighten the plane.
You wouldn't sell a salesman, would you?
Fred is fine.
He's calculating headwind speed versus fuel as we speak.
So what's that I hear in your voice?
Is he drinking?
I can handle it.
All right, call it off.
Call it off now.
Right now, Amelia.
I mean it.
Right now.
I can handle it.
After the 4th, we're going home.
Where is that?
For me?
Anywhere you are.
I'm going to like it there.
I'd better, since this is going to be my last flight.
If you insist.
I love you.
Should I let you go now?
No, never.
I'll go tell the world you're on your way.
See you, my darling.
See you, my love.
It looks like she's ready to leave.
Might be easier to just shoot me.
Traveling light, is all.
You got room for 180 pounds of asshole?
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
It's fine.
Everything is.
Have you filled the other side?
Not more than a month ago, I was on the other shore of the Pacific, looking westward.
This morning, I look eastward over the Pacific.
In these fast-moving days that have intervened, the whole width of the world has passed behind us except this broad ocean.
I shall be glad when we have the hazards of this navigation behind us.
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.
Mr. Putnam.
The headwinds were stronger than they knew when they took off.
I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them 9%.
9%.
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?
Mr. Putnam, I can 't reach them, sir.
I tried voice and Morse Code.
No, forget Morse Code.
They didn't take the receiver.
Just stay with voice.
You'll get them.
At ease, sailor.

How long has this been left on?
The battery's dead.
Itasca, this is Earhart.
We're about 200 miles out.

Your signal received okay.
It is impossible to take a bearing on 3105 on your voice.
Send us a longer transmission, please.
Over.
A report has come in from the ship for Mr. Putnam.
God.
Miss Earhart has finally received transmission from Itasca.
Keep us at 7500.
That's her only acknowledgment.
You've got her signal, damn it.
What about the direction finder?
Cipriani reports the battery's dead, sir.
It was left on all night, so we can't track her.
King How Able Queen Queen to Itasca.
Earhart, will you please come in and reply on 500?
We are transmitting constantly on 7500 and we cannot hear you on 500.
Despite constant attempts, the USS Itasca has lost contact with Amelia Earhart.
Come on.
Come on.
King How Able Queen Queen to Itasca.
We are on the position line 157-337.
We are running north and south.
Over.
We hear you.
We hear you.
Are you receiving us?
Earhart, this is Itasca.
Did you receive transmission?
Subtitles:

Itasca to Earhart, come in, please.
All the things I never said for so very long, look up, they're in my eyes.
Everyone has oceans to fly.
As long as you have the heart to do it.
Is it reckless?
Maybe.
But what do dreams know of boundaries?
I think about the hands I have held,
the places I've seen,
the vast lands whose dirt is caked on the bottom of my shoes.
The world has changed me.

NEWSCASTER:

(CHUCKLING) I fly for the fun of it.

I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them 9%.
9%.
AMELIA:
When I saw that little plane, it lifted me above the Kansas prairie.
I had to fly.
My daddy had the wanderlust.
That's why I like to keep moving.
Flying lets me move in 3 dimensions.
Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?
SECRETARY:
Miss Earhart?
Mr. Putnam will see you now.
GEORGE:
Send the papers over this afternoon.
Thank you, bye.
-Miss Earhart?
-Mr.
Putnam?
Please, sit.
I'm told you want to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.
-I do.
-Why do you want to fly?
-Why?
-Why do you want to fly?
Why does a man ride a horse?
Because he wants to, I guess.
3 women have died trying.
2 others have escaped with their lives.
If you do make it, you will be the first, which is the real attraction for both of us, I expect.
Always nice to know what the real attraction is.
The plane was bought from Admiral Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite, who's asked to find an American.
Educated, well-spoken, a flier and preferably physically attractive.
Why would that matter?
Because she wants the world to pay attention.
And pretty girls command more attention.
Was that your advice?
There'll be a contract for the girl's story with The New York Times.
Also a book to be published under her name.
But all the money from this will go to Mrs. Guest.
Except for the part that goes to you.
Well, this is America, and therefore I am obligated to make as much money as I can.
(LAUGHING)
You have a wonderful laugh, Miss Earhart.
You said she wants a flier.
Don't get your hopes up.
The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be pilot.
There will be a male co-pilot who will also serve as navigator.
The woman will be purely a passenger.
Take Lindbergh.
I published his book 3 months after his historic flight.
Must be wonderful to actually know him, to be a friend of his.
Friend?
Good God, no.
(SNORTS) Can't stand the man.
He's a stiff-ass, sanctimonious, boring prude.
Was a bestseller though.
Why would anyone want to read a book written by a passenger?
Because the hook is that they're gonna make the woman commander.
The pilot will sign a contract saying he's under your direction and control.
It would be your flight.
My fraud, you mean.
A very distasteful word in book publishing, Miss Earhart.
I don't know, Mr. Putnam.
My dream has always been to fly across the Atlantic, but the way you want me to do it is far from the way I've envisioned it.
Let me be frank.
With your level of flight experience, I wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would normally be considered for this, if a woman were to do any flying at all.
Miss Earhart, let me be painfully clear,
I give the orders and you take them.
And if you do as you're told, you'll be a star.
And I will be nearby, a small particle of dust in your constellation.
Spoken like a gentleman.
Miss Earhart.
Mr. Putnam.
Of course, a gentleman would've paid for my ticket.
What the hell are they?
Oryx!
Look how free they are!
No constraints, no schedules to keep.
For a gal who don't like schedules, you sure got yourself hooked up with the wrong fella in Mr. Putnam.
Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.
Say hello to Slim Gordon, your navigator.
How do you do?
And Bill Stultz,
-the best pilot working today.
-Hello, Bill.
How much fuel do you lose because of these?
Costs us at least 400 gallons.
Well, then why have them?
GEORGE:
The owner wants to protect her plane in case you have to ditch it at sea.
But those are decisions I have to make, not somebody else.
They're not making this trip, we are.
But she owns the plane, and this is still America, Miss Earhart.
Ownership is the trump card.
Sad to say, but dollars put planes in the air.
I wonder if it can keep us up there, not that I've ever had enough to try.
Our job is to figure out how to fly this beauty without gasoline.
Include the whole engine up here.
The name is Amelia Earhart.
TECHNICIAN:
Careful up there, Slim.
GEORGE:
They're leaving for Newfoundland.
Yes, they'll be taking off for there tomorrow, weather permitting.
Make sure the reporters are there.
Goodbye.
Popping-off letters.
For my dad, my mom, and my sis.
You know, in case.
I'm honored that you would leave these with me.
Who else?
If I do pop off, it's your fault.
Pray I make it.
Not much of a prayer man.
Then at least tip your hat and cross your fingers.
Well,
-see you.
-See you.
NEWSCASTER ON FILM:
It's a short hop from Boston to Newfoundland for Amelia Earhart and crew.
Then on to Ireland, and possibly the record books.
Earhart and top-notch ace Bill Stultz have to get airborne, quite a feat once their plane is fully loaded for the Atlantic crossing.
Seems like we got a situation here, a real problem.
When you figure it out, Commander, let us know.
(MEN LAUGHING)
BILL:
I don't even know what the hell I'm saying anymore.
Here's to Little Miss Earhart, who couldn't lift a pigeon off the ground!
(BANGING ON DOOR)
(SLEEPILY) What time is it?
It's time to fly.
Get up, get dressed, we're going now.
Where's the weather report?
It's not good enough.
Great.
Either we fly to Ireland or you're going home today.
Well, it's not good enough.
It's fine.
There's a tailwind all the way.
We'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind will get us to Ireland.
You're dumping fuel?
You're serious?
Just as serious as you're hung-over.
Slim, you go now.
Get the late weather.
We'll meet you at the plane.
(STAMMERING)
Slim, go.
I've got this.
I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill.
He's the most caring and generous and charming and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know.
He's my father.
He's a drunk, and he's let me down all my life.
Now you get out of that goddamn bed, and you fly that plane to Ireland, or I swear to you, I will.
Good.
Slim, start the engines.
This report indicates some degree of risk.
It's a risk I'm taking.
Have a nice flight.
Read tomorrow's papers, Bill!
We'll both be in them.
(REPORTERS CHATTERING)
So, to take off, you pull back on the thing, right?

MAN:
I'm afraid we've lost contact with Miss Earhart's plane, sir.
Keep me informed.
Thank you.
We've been flying for 19 hours plus.
How far to land?
Radio is still out.
There's no way to compute wind speed and drift in the clouds, so God only knows where Ireland is.
There may be an hour of gasoline left.
Probably less.
If we land on the water now, we might have a rescue.
And a failure!
That's out.
Hold on to something, for Christ's sake!
Slim, go help her.
Hang on!
Okay, I'm coming.
Hold on.
Got it.
Take my hand.

AMELIA:
As I look back on the flight,
I think of 2 questions that have been asked me most frequently:
"Where are you going next?"
and "What did you wear?"
Lucky Strike endorsement.
I wrote the copy myself.
What does it say?
"I don't smoke, but you should"?
No, it says that Lucky Strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship.
Which is true.
I hid them under the seat.
True, maybe, but misleading.
Why would I sign that?
So that Bill and Slim get paid.
NEWSCASTER:
Amelia Earhart, the only woman to fly across the Atlantic, just can't keep her feet on the ground.
The publisher George Putnam has commissioned her to write a book on her flying adventures.

You're welcome, Miss Earhart.
AMELIA:
You didn't have to come get me.
You do have a dress to change into, I hope.
-Well, it's just a college class, George.
-No, no, no.
No.
You have to take every appearance seriously.
You never know what it might lead to.
Spoken by a man who should know.
What was that for?
Good luck?
What happened to tipping your hat and crossing your fingers?
Oh, I'm afraid I'm way beyond that now, like it or not.
I think I like it.
What did your mother say when she knew you flew across the Atlantic?
Well, she sent a telegram congratulating me and then she said the next time she wants to sit beside me in the cockpit.
(ALL LAUGHING)
How did it feel to fly over the ocean?
Were you scared?
When I looked down at the sea, it seemed much like the sky to me.
As if the sky and the sea were the same.
I felt much as I do when I'm flying upward toward the sun.
Transported somehow to a simple, safe, beautiful place, where everything is comprehensible.

Depends on whether you want the real or the sell.
Oh, I don't underestimate the value of selling.
A 16-year-old girl makes headlines illegally flying under the 4 bridges of the East River.
You don't seem to need much help selling yourself.
Actually, Mr. Putnam,
I was hoping you could do to me what you've done to her.
What's your primary ambition?
To take Amelia's place as the number 1 female pilot.
-You want a tip?
-I do.
If I listened to everyone who said it was impossible,
I'd never be flying.
Don't let anyone turn you around.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
MAN:
You're all here.
WOMAN:
Thank you.
So lovely to see you.
-Hello.
-MAN 1:
Good evening.
WOMAN:
Good evening, Miss Earhart.
MAN:
Marvelous party.
Oh, Amelia.
This is Gene Vidal.
Amelia Earhart, the aviatrix.
She's a friend of George's.
How do you do, Miss Earhart?
(CHUCKLING) Quite well, Mr. Vidal.
Thank you.
I understand you're writing a book about your transatlantic journey under the tutelage of the master.
Yes.
You enjoying your stay here in Rye?
I must say, I'm a bit out of my element.
The distance between this world and where I come from is as great as the distance between the sun and the moon.
And you believe the whole "opposites attract" theory is...
Pure hooey.
Pure hooey.
-Where are you from?
-Kansas.
"Hooey" is a Kansas word?
Yes, I suppose it is.
Public relations.
It's a new field, entirely new.
It's not publicity, not promotion.
GENE:
Miss Earhart.
May I call you Amelia?
We may be from different worlds, but we have more in common than you might imagine.
-Is that so?
-Yes.
I'm a teacher, at West Point, true, but still a teacher.
What do you teach?
Flying.
Listen, Amelia... (SIGHS)
This is the first time I've ever seen you stumped for a word.
(SIGHS)
What is it?
Marry me.
-What?
-I want you to marry me.
I don't want to get married, George.
I'm not the marrying kind.
Don't you see you and I embarking on a new life?
Dear George.
Only I can make a fulfilling life for myself.
I don't believe that one can have a fulfilled life alone.
Only when it's shared.
Let me share your life with you.
Let me try to give you whatever you want.
When I was a little girl, for my 7th birthday
my father gave me a globe.
And I'd spend hours just spinning it slowly, reading the names of all those strange, faraway places.
Morocco.
Spain.
Ethiopia.
Dreaming that someday I would go to those places, like a wayfarer,
a traveler, a vagabond.
I want to be free, George.
To be a vagabond of the air.
I'll help you get there.
(CHILDREN CHEERING)
AMELIA:
Thanks.
AMELIA:
Hello!
Give me the camera.
AMELIA:
I am on my shining adventure, flying the world.
No borders, just horizons.
Only freedom.
AMELIA:
Dear G.P.,
You must know again my reluctance to marry, my feeling that I shatter thereby my life in flying, which means so much to me.
In this connection, I may have to keep some place where I can go to be myself now and then, for I cannot guarantee to endure at all the confinements of even an attractive cage.
"In our life together,
"I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me
"nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.
"I must exact a cruel promise.
"And that is, you will let me go in a year
"if we find no happiness together."
Only you, my dear Amelia, could say those brutal words to me
and still have me wanting to be with you.
Forever.
MINISTER:
Amelia, do you promise to love, honor and obey this man...
Excuse me, sir?
May we take that back a bit, please?
Love, yes, if it's warranted.
Honor, same thing.
Obey, I can't promise that under any circumstances, but the groom understands that.
Please remove "obey" from the prayer so we can wrap this up before the bride runs off.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
(GUESTS CHEERING)
MAN: (ON PA) Announcing the first Women's Air Derby, racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland.
Yeah, that's fine.
What's this we're hearing?
Advance press release.
The gentlemen who are running the Derby are about to announce the race has to end west of the Rockies.
-What?
-Mom-hmm.
That's absurd, they're cutting out half the route.
What are they thinking?
They're thinking that it would be bad press when you girls start smashing into the Rocky Mountains.
How dare they?
I'm gonna have a word with these gentlemen.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no.
Come here and walk with me.
I think it would benefit women fliers everywhere if Amelia won the Derby.
You know, the publicity would put the race and all of you up there with the boys.
Well, maybe I'll win the race myself.
Well, you can't win if your plane doesn't pass the final inspection.
And let me predict that it won't.
-Well, that's a threat.
-No.
A prediction.
Amelia's the one who said I shouldn't let anybody turn me around.
Yeah, she probably meant me.
Well, obviously she doesn't see me as a threat.
Oh, sure, she does.
She just doesn't care.
Hey, Gladys!
I let the boys in charge know, in no uncertain terms, we're not changing our route!
We'll sail over those mountains like we're eagles.
I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor.
This is what my loyalty requires.
MAN: (ON PA) Lady Lindy herself, Amelia Earhart!
Clear!
NEWSCASTER:
Amelia Earhart organizes a competition for women pilots.
9 cities in 9 days.
Tragedy strikes, and there are crashes along the way.
The race continues.
Thousands plan to be on hand to witness those who make it as they approach the finish line.
MAN: (ON PA) Here they come, folks.
In 1st place, Louise Haden from Bentonville, Arkansas!
In 2nd place, Gladys O'Donnell from Long Beach, California.
3rd place goes to Amelia Earhart, Atchison, Kansas!
(BAND PLAYING FANFARE MUSIC)
How does it feel to finish 3rd?
A victory for any woman flier is a victory for me.
AMELIA: (ON PA) I'd like to add my congratulations to Louise Haden and announce that we have formed an organization to promote women in aviation.
99 women pilots have applied, so we're calling it The 99s.
And we're going to fly forever!
-George?
-Mom-hmm?
-I've been thinking.
-Yes?
I want to fly the Atlantic.
You already have.
As a passenger.
It doesn't count.
I want to fly it solo.
It's been 5 years since Lindbergh.
No one has made it solo.
14 have died trying.
I'll make it.
I know I will.
(SIGHING) And if you don't?
I'd rather face a watery grave than go on living as a fraud.
What's wrong with that?
I've been very successful at it.
(LAUGHING)
NEWSCASTER:
Amelia Earhart demonstrates her flying prowess and adventurous spirit.
And now she is set to climb to new heights on her 2nd attempt to cross the Atlantic.
No more a passenger, this time Miss Earhart will do it alone.
Still sleepy?
Well, I'll nap on the way.
Good news about flying solo, no one making noise.
Do you have money?
No.
A whole 20?
I spent our money on ocean liner passage.
Going to bring you back.
It's non-refundable.
Please do your part.
I will.
Well, see you.
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:
Please clear the runway for takeoff.
(WHISPERING) See you.
WEA THERMAN:
Presently all clear over the Atlantic, keeping an eye on a storm system south of the route.

It was a night of stars, of tropic loveliness.
Stars hung outside my cockpit window near enough to touch.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
If Lindbergh did it, you can do it.
MAN:
No sign of Miss Earhart yet, Mr. Putnam, sir.

NEWSCASTER:
Le Bourget Airport, France.
A galaxy of press, well-wishers and ambassadors alike has gathered here in Paris in anticipation of the historic moment when Amelia Earhart will touch down where Lindbergh did years ago.
The world waits with bated breath as Amelia flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
(COUGHING)
(LAUGHS)
-Jimmy, look at that there.
-What do you see?
(LAUGHING)
(EXCLAIMS)
(WHOOPING)
Excuse me, sir.
Where am I?
Uh...
In Gallagher's pasture.
Where are you supposed to be?
When I left, I was aiming for Paris.
Oh.
You missed, you know.
It's over there.
(SHEEP BLEATING)
Well, hello, sheep!
(PHONE RINGS)
(SIGHS) Yes.
MAN:
Miss Earhart has arrived safely, sir.
She's landed in Ireland.
Wonderful.
Wonderful news!
NEWSCASTER:
Journey's end.
Here she is, safe and sound on a farm in Ireland having just completed the first flight by a woman across the Atlantic.
And there's the little plane in which she's broken all records.
Well done.
Well done.
(AMELIA LAUGHING)
(BAND PLAYING SWING MUSIC)
Action!
You're on vacation with Amelia Earhart luggage.
Travel the Nile, moonlight...
I'm sorry, I can't say this.
I try to put the freedom that is flying into my clothes!
Eastman Kodak cameras.
Travel the world, save your memories.
The 2nd person to fly the Atlantic solo,
-and the first one to fly it twice.
-Standing room only, good.
14 hours and 54 minutes.
Are you staying for this?
No, I can't.
I gotta meet the features editor at the Post and then organize that photo shoot for the new luggage line.
What's wrong with you today?
Here I am jumping through hoops like a white horse in the circus.
That's what's wrong.
The only way that we can finance your flying is to make enough money to finance your flying.
...Amelia Earhart!
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Go on out there.
Thank you!
Thank you very much.
GIRL:
Oh.
Please!
Miss Earhart?
An autograph, please.
Miss Earhart, please.
BOY:
Miss Earhart?
-What's your name?
-Gore.
That's an unusual name.
I know.
I don't much like it.
We blame his mother.
She was a Gore, roots going back to colonial times.
Hello.
God, do I have to wade through that?
You will have 2 Vidal men to protect you.
You'll be fine.
You are so much prettier than your pictures.
Well, thank you, but that...
MAN:
Have you heard from Lindbergh?
What did he say?
"Well done."
Are you gonna write another book?
Yes, if my husband has anything to say about it.
Take my hand.
Come on, Gore.
Let's you and I lead Miss Earhart to safety.
You know, that woman was right.
-Excuse me?
-I felt the same way when I first met you.
You are much prettier than your pictures.
It all seems rather silly considering what's happening out there.
Those men, all those families.
Why have I been given so much?
You've earned the spotlight.
Enjoy it.
You'll be fine.
Just hold on to yourself.
I'm not sure who that is anymore.
She's that girl from Kansas who says "hooey."
(CHUCKLING)
MAN: (ON PA) Distinguished dignitaries from every corner of the world, please rise and welcome Miss Amelia Earhart, honored guest of President Roosevelt and the League of American Pilots.
I'd like to toast a world-class pilot who, at age 15, became the youngest woman in the world to fly solo.
This year, she's recognized as Woman Pilot of the Year.
Here's to Elinor Smith, an inspiration to us all.
(ALL TOASTING)
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT:
Your husband encourages you to fly across the Atlantic.
My husband wouldn't want me to fly to N Street.
So, he hasn't actually forbidden you?
Franklin doesn't forbid.
He just feels it's a waste of my valuable time to learn since I can't afford to buy a plane.
The wrong Roosevelt got elected.
(CHUCKLES)
I did ask about aviation, but he hasn't decided on the structure yet.
It might be under the Bureau of Commerce.
I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it.
I'm sorry, my hearing's failing.
I missed the words "or woman"?
This may be one of those rare instances when the most accomplished candidate turns out to be male.
Is it a name I know?
Gene Vidal.
I love finding the exception that proves the rule.
How do you feel about flying at night?
Whoa!
There we are, ladies and gentlemen, champagne.
Champagne to toast the first lady.
(CHUCKLING)
Put your hands on the wheel!
It's dual controls.
No one'll ever know.
GEORGE:
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to toast to you!
Oh.
Dear God!
(LAUGHING)
Good night.
MRS. ROOSEVELT:
Well, I shall never, ever forget this night.
She seems quite taken with you.
And vice-versa.
Then again, lots of people are quite taken with you.
If you're referring to Gene, as I know you are,
I was able to get a word in for him, to head the Aeronautics Branch.
How did it go?
It's her husband's decision, but I'm hopeful.
Gene is so fortunate to have you in his corner, Amelia.
He'll help me and I'm helping him.
(PLAYING YOU DO SOMETHING TO ME)
You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me Why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me
Transcontinental was too ambitious.
Too many hops, too tough on the ladies.
But the shuttle, Washington, New York, Boston, we think it's the future.
Will you go there with us?
What on earth would you need me for?
(CHUCKLES) You're the most famous woman in America, that's what for.
(CHUCKLING)
You know, I can see it now.
You on the poster with Gene, a legendary athlete at West Point,
2 events at the Olympics, a top pilot who's gonna be running the skies for Roosevelt when he wins.
Thanks, Paul.
I think you've even talked me out of it.
(LAUGHING)
Do, do that voodoo that you do so well...
May I ask you a question?
May I ask you a question?
That woman over there.
She's beautiful.
You're the only woman I know who points out other beautiful women.
Lovely legs, unlike mine.
No, I'm sure that's not true.
That's why you wear trousers?
No.
And all this while I thought you just wanted to be one of the boys.
I may have, at one time, but not anymore.
MAN:
Was that Amelia Earhart?
GENE: 6th floor, please.
(BELL DINGS)
(DOORS OPENING)
Gore!
AMELIA:
I couldn't wait for your visit this weekend.
Lewis.
Lewis.
Help!
Tiger, tiger!
Ah.
The wallpaper.
(LAUGHS)
Coming, Gore.
It's okay.
Do you know why I papered this room like this?
No.
But I wish you hadn't.
It's because I'm very, very afraid of jungles.
So, when I find myself worrying about it,
I test my courage by coming into this room and pretending I'm in the deepest, darkest part of Africa.
In a jungle so thick, I can 't even see the sky above.
And I start to feel better right away because I looked my fear right in the face.
Miss Earhart?
Yes?
Could you please marry my father?
Then I'll never be afraid of anything ever again.
Aw.
I'm already married to Mr. Putnam.
Why can't you be married to Mr. Putnam and my father?
I put together one month in Europe.
Had to close some foreign licensing deals, open new markets.
When are you leaving?
Well, the thing is, I'd like you to come.
I don't see how I could.
Well, I've already spoken to the promoters.
They're willing to switch some of the lecture dates, just for us.
Well, it's not just that.
There's my work on the shuttle.
I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
Normally I'd be worried about leaving you here alone, but I suppose that won't be a problem, will it?
What are you trying to say?
(EXHALES TREMULOUSLY)
Gene, here in our house, when I am here, is one thing.
When I am not here,
-I can't have it.
-I understand.
I can't have it.
(MEN SINGING IN LOCAL LANGUAGE)
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
(SIGHS)
I found something you'd written.
Quite beautiful.
"To touch your hand and see your face today is joy.
"Your casual presence in a room recalls the stars
"that watched us as we lay.
"I mark you in the moving crowd and see again those stars
"a warm night lent us long ago.
"We loved so then, we love so now."
Thank you so much for writing that.
(RESTRAINING SOBS) Even though I'd never seen it.
At the time, I...
George?
(SIGHS)
(SLAMS PHONE DOWN)
George.
Thank you.
GENE:
How are you?
I wondered if you were avoiding me a little or...
Just very, very busy.
I'm leaving for Indiana.
Edward Elliott of Purdue wants me to build a Women's Careers Department there.
That's a wonderful idea, especially now.
What's special about now?
You don't read the papers?
Not unless someone makes me.
Well, someone should.
They're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose other than publicity, meaning money.
They also harp on a growing list of products you commercially endorse.
How thoughtless of me to be doing all this in a society where no one else is interested in making money, present company included.
People viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's sweetheart of the skies, the wife, mother, daughter they all wish they'd had, would be helpful.
Thanks for the tip.
Thanks for not being defensive.
I've decided I'm resigning as your consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
The public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together.
And you, of all people, should know that whatever I do,
I do so that I can fly.
And I want to fly that beautiful bird as far as it will take me.
I'm going to fly around the world, Gene.
It can't be done.
Well, I'm going to try.
And I'm going home.
To George.
You can't mean that.
Race you to New York City.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
(GEORGE LAUGHING)
Well, are you going to tell me your surprise, or do I need to be physical?
Boy, that's exactly what I want.
Come on, G.P., tell me.
If you're serious about this flying-around-the-world nonsense, then it might be handy to have a plane to fly in.
Except it would have to be an Electra, and they cost... $36,000, after a generous discount from Lockheed.
It may as well be a billion.
Not to mention at least another $36,000 to have it modified and ready.
And your surprise is you robbed a bank?
No, actually, a university.
I persuaded Ed Elliott to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue.
I suggested a budget amount of $80,000 for a suitable flying laboratory.
The Electra?
Your Electra, Amelia.
George!
(GEORGE LAUGHING)
Well, there is one thing.
The trustees and the donors, they have to be on board also.
Well, that's my job.
I'll do a series of lectures...
No, there will be no more horses, no more hoops, for my Amelia.
Thank you, George.
Even if you don't care if she lives or dies, you know her death will not be a plus for aviation women, or your next campaign.
What if she doesn't die?
What if she just circumnavigates the globe and it's a plus for everyone?
The closest land west of Hawaii is beyond the range of the Electra.
She'll refuel in the air.
She doesn't have the flying skills.
She's taking bigger risks.
Yes.
I'm aware of that.
Don't be so proud of it.
I understand the danger, fellas.
I've studied the route.
What have you come up with?
This is Howland Island.
It's halfway between Honolulu and New Guinea.
It has no elevation, no trees, hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.
It would be almost impossible to spot from the air.
It's really tiny, like a grain of sand in a thousand miles of nowhere.
If you miss this island, you're out of fuel with 2,000 miles to go.
But I'll have Fred Noonan, the best celestial navigator around.
In fact, she's taking Fred along for the whole trip.
Giving up my little arrogance about solo.
Safety first, yes?
You've always had Amelia's best interest at heart.
And for that, we're both grateful.
Stay for supper?
I'd like to, but I'd better be getting back.
Please tell Gore hello for me.
Give him this.
He can track the time zones.
He misses you.
He doesn't understand, really.
Is the new gasket up to spec, Jim?
Everything's good, Miss Earhart.
(DOOR OPENING)
Hello, Fred.
Ma'am.
-Good to see you.
-And you.
Thank you.
Are we sizing me up?
I'm told midair refueling would be beyond my abilities.
You have to put in time, learn the technique.
Even so, 20%, it works, 20%, you crash, 60%, you don't get the fuel, so you're cooked anyway.
Better odds of hitting that island?
How do you feel about 100%?
Even with cloud cover?
Pan Am told you I'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen.
They did.
Someone else told you I got a drinking problem.
Which is a big part of why we're here, right?
Everyone I ever worked for will tell you, nothing's interfered with my performance, not once.
We'd be looking for an island less than 2 miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet.
That's what you'd be looking for.
I'd be looking for coordinates on a map.
How can I lose?

Amelia Earhart leaves Oakland for Honolulu, setting out on the most dangerous aeronautic feat ever attempted:
to traverse the waistline of the world.

The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another 3 years.
Maybe.
No, it will, I promise.
Our sales, our prices are going to double.
This just showed them how dangerous it all is.
They were taking it for granted.
They thought I was competent.
Here.
I meant, maybe...
Maybe we can just stop it.
You mean after?
Or even now.
So my exit would be a stupid crash and withdrawing from a world-publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before.
It would ruin us in the bargain.
-Mmm-hmm.
Yes.
-We'd have nothing.
Mmm-hmm.
It's true.
And I'd be fine with that.

I'd be facing hurricanes in the Caribbean, monsoons in Africa.
Yeah, but you'll be flying Howland last.
-When I'm most tired.
-Yeah.
So, I just won't get tired.
What's the timetable on the plane?
3 weeks.
She'll be good as new.
We have a remarkable crew here.
-The best that money can...
-Money can buy.
buy, yeah.
All the money wasted that's never coming back.
You cut the engines.
It would've cost a bundle more to replace a burnt-out plane.
Not to mention a burnt-up pilot.
I overreacted.
The plane was too heavy, I should've used more rudder instead of the throttle.
I...
It's only money.
We'll figure this out.
We always do.
Have you considered, Miss Earhart, that your enthusiasm as a pilot outweighs your ability, as demonstrated by the disaster in Honolulu?
People are saying that you're reckless, a better celebrity than pilot.
Enthusiastic?
Yes.
Reckless?
Not on your life.
I'm a flier pursuing my passion for the fun of it, that's all.
Thank you.

That's a touching love story.
An honest one, if I say so myself.
I wonder if it's honest enough for George.
If you mean Gene, we're not together anymore.
In that way.
Not for a long time.
You don't think I love my husband?
Actually, I do.
In a certain way.
But you disapprove of how I live?
Hell, no.
It's just like me.
In fact, it's like most guys I know.
Meaning?
Guys love their wives, their girlfriends.
Doesn't mean they don't take advantage of an opportunity.
If you have a point, make it.
I believe I have.
All you need to do is just show up tomorrow morning, show up sober, and get me to Howland Island.
(DOOR SQUEAKING OPEN)
Ready, ma'am.
Thank you.
Feel like stepping out for a smoke?
Oh, I don't smoke.
Or something?
Earhart here.
Putnam here.
You should be sleeping.
You should be working.
I'm running a big adventure here.
I'm a very important fellow.
You told me I was the star and you'd be nearby, a small particle of dust in my constellation.
I thought I was joking.
Guess the joke's on me.
I'll be in Honolulu on the 3rd and with you in Oakland on the 4th of July, okay?
Don't keep me waiting.
I won't dare.
How's Fred?
On the wagon?
I sent you my movies to lighten the plane.
You wouldn't sell a salesman, would you?
Fred is fine.
He's calculating headwind speed versus fuel as we speak.
So what's that I hear in your voice?
Is he drinking?
I can handle it.
(SIGHS) All right, call it off.
Call it off now.
Right now, Amelia.
I mean it.
Right now.
(SOFTLY) I can handle it.
After the 4th, we're going home.
Where is that?
For me?
Anywhere you are.
I'm going to like it there.
I'd better, since this is going to be my last flight.
(SOFTLY) If you insist.
I love you.
Should I let you go now?
(WHISPERING) No, never.
I'll go tell the world you're on your way.
See you, my darling.
See you, my love.

Everything is.

Not more than a month ago, I was on the other shore of the Pacific, looking westward.
This morning, I look eastward over the Pacific.

I shall be glad when we have the hazards of this navigation behind us.

All the things I never said for so very long, look up, they're in my eyes.
Everyone has oceans to fly.
As long as you have the heart to do it.
Is it reckless?
Maybe.
But what do dreams know of boundaries?
I think about the hands I have held,
the places I've seen,
the vast lands whose dirt is caked on the bottom of my shoes.
The world has changed me.

NEWSCASTER:
She will fly the world's full circumference, 24,902 miles, to travel across the South Atlantic, crossing Africa, over India...
After this 'round-the-world flight, Miss Earhart, are you gonna give up long-distance flying?
Not while there's still life left in me.
(CHUCKLING) I fly for the fun of it.
WOMAN 1:
Good luck!

All right, give us a big smile!

AMELIA:
When I saw that little plane, it lifted me above the Kansas prairie.
I had to fly.
My daddy had the wanderlust.
That's why I like to keep moving.
Flying lets me move in three dimensions.
Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?
SECRETARY:
Miss Earhart?
Mr. Putnam will see you now.
GEORGE:
Send the papers over this afternoon.
Thank you, bye.
-Miss Earhart?
-Mr.
Putnam?
Please, sit.
I'm told you want to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.
-I do.
-Why do you want to fly?
-Why?
-Why do you want to fly?
Why does a man ride a horse?
Because he wants to, I guess.
Three women have died trying.
Two others have escaped with their lives.
If you do make it, you will be the first, which is the real attraction for both of us, I expect.
Always nice to know what the real attraction is.
The plane was bought from Admiral Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite, who's asked to find an American.
Educated, well-spoken, a flier and preferably physically attractive.
Why would that matter?
Because she wants the world to pay attention.
And pretty girls command more attention.
Was that your advice?
There'll be a contract for the girl's story with The New York Times.
Also a book to be published under her name.
But all the money from this will go to Mrs. Guest.
Except for the part that goes to you.
Well, this is America, and therefore I am obligated to make as much money as I can.
(LAUGHING)
You have a wonderful laugh, Miss Earhart.
You said she wants a flier.
Don't get your hopes up.
The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be pilot.
There will be a male co-pilot who will also serve as navigator.
The woman will be purely a passenger.
Take Lindbergh.
I published his book three months after his historic flight.
Must be wonderful to actually know him, to be a friend of his.
Friend?
Good God, no.
(SNORTS) Can't stand the man.
He's a stiff-ass, sanctimonious, boring prude.
Was a bestseller though.
Why would anyone want to read a book written by a passenger?
Because the hook is that they're gonna make the woman commander.
The pilot will sign a contract saying he's under your direction and control.
It would be your flight.
My fraud, you mean.
A very distasteful word in book publishing, Miss Earhart.
I don't know, Mr. Putnam.
My dream has always been to fly across the Atlantic, but the way you want me to do it is far from the way I've envisioned it.
Let me be frank.
With your level of flight experience, I wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would normally be considered for this, if a woman were to do any flying at all.
Miss Earhart, let me be painfully clear,
I give the orders and you take them.
And if you do as you're told, you'll be a star.
And I will be nearby, a small particle of dust in your constellation.
Spoken like a gentleman.
Miss Earhart.
Mr. Putnam.
Of course, a gentleman would've paid for my ticket.
What the hell are they?
Oryx!
Look how free they are!
No constraints, no schedules to keep.
For a gal who don't like schedules, you sure got yourself hooked up with the wrong fella in Mr. Putnam.
Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.
Say hello to Slim Gordon, your navigator.
How do you do?
And Bill Stultz,
-the best pilot working today.
-Hello, Bill.
How much fuel do you lose because of these?
Costs us at least 400 gallons.
Well, then why have them?
GEORGE:
The owner wants to protect her plane in case you have to ditch it at sea.
But those are decisions I have to make, not somebody else.
They're not making this trip, we are.
But she owns the plane, and this is still America, Miss Earhart.
Ownership is the trump card.
Sad to say, but dollars put planes in the air.
I wonder if it can keep us up there, not that I've ever had enough to try.
Our job is to figure out how to fly this beauty without gasoline.
Include the whole engine up here.
The name is Amelia Earhart.
TECHNICIAN:
Careful up there, Slim.
GEORGE:
They're leaving for Newfoundland.
Yes, they'll be taking off for there tomorrow, weather permitting.
Make sure the reporters are there.
Goodbye.
Popping-off letters.
For my dad, my mom, and my sis.
You know, in case.
I'm honored that you would leave these with me.
Who else?
If I do pop off, it's your fault.
Pray I make it.
Not much of a prayer man.
Then at least tip your hat and cross your fingers.
Well,
-see you.
-See you.
NEWSCASTER ON FILM:
It's a short hop from Boston to Newfoundland for Amelia Earhart and crew.
Then on to Ireland, and possibly the record books.
Earhart and top-notch ace Bill Stultz have to get airborne, quite a feat once their plane is fully loaded for the Atlantic crossing.
Seems like we got a situation here, a real problem.
When you figure it out, Commander, let us know.

It's time to fly.
Get up, get dressed, we're going now.
Where's the weather report?
It's not good enough.
Great.
Either we fly to Ireland or you're going home today.
Well, it's not good enough.
It's fine.
There's a tailwind all the way.
We'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind will get us to Ireland.
You're dumping fuel?
You're serious?
Just as serious as you're hung-over.
Slim, you go now.
Get the late weather.
We'll meet you at the plane.
(STAMMERING)
Slim, go.
I've got this.
I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill.
He's the most caring and generous and charming and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know.
He's my father.
He's a drunk, and he's let me down all my life.
Now you get out of that goddamn bed, and you fly that plane to Ireland, or I swear to you, I will.
Good.
Slim, start the engines.
This report indicates some degree of risk.
It's a risk I'm taking.
Have a nice flight.
Read tomorrow's papers, Bill!
We'll both be in them.

There's no way to compute wind speed and drift in the clouds, so God only knows where Ireland is.
There may be an hour of gasoline left.
Probably less.
If we land on the water now, we might have a rescue.
And a failure!
That's out.

Lucky Strike endorsement.
I wrote the copy myself.

"I don't smoke, but you should"?
No, it says that Lucky Strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship.
Which is true.
I hid them under the seat.
True, maybe, but misleading.
Why would I sign that?
So that Bill and Slim get paid.

Good luck?
What happened to tipping your hat and crossing your fingers?
Oh, I'm afraid I'm way beyond that now, like it or not.
I think I like it.
What did your mother say when she knew you flew across the Atlantic?
Well, she sent a telegram congratulating me and then she said the next time she wants to sit beside me in the cockpit.
(ALL LAUGHING)
How did it feel to fly over the ocean?
Were you scared?
When I looked down at the sea, it seemed much like the sky to me.
As if the sky and the sea were the same.
I felt much as I do when I'm flying upward toward the sun.
Transported somehow to a simple, safe, beautiful place, where everything is comprehensible.

They're saying you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit.

-On a bad week.
Depends on whether you want the real or the sell.
Oh, I don't underestimate the value of selling.
A 16-year-old girl makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the East River.
You don't seem to need much help selling yourself.
Actually, Mr. Putnam,
I was hoping you could do to me what you've done to her.
What's your primary ambition?
To take Amelia's place as the number one female pilot.

You must know again my reluctance to marry, my feeling that I shatter thereby my life in flying, which means so much to me.
In this connection, I may have to keep some place where I can go to be myself now and then, for I cannot guarantee to endure at all the confinements of even an attractive cage.
"In our life together,
"I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me
"nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.
"I must exact a cruel promise.

Only you, my dear Amelia, could say those brutal words to me
and still have me wanting to be with you.

They're thinking that it would be bad press when you girls start smashing into the Rocky Mountains.
How dare they?
I'm gonna have a word with these gentlemen.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no.
Come here and walk with me.
I think it would benefit women fliers everywhere if Amelia won the Derby.
You know, the publicity would put the race and all of you up there with the boys.
Well, maybe I'll win the race myself.
Well, you can't win if your plane doesn't pass the final inspection.
And let me predict that it won't.
-Well, that's a threat.
-No.

Amelia's the one who said I shouldn't let anybody turn me around.
Yeah, she probably meant me.
Well, obviously she doesn't see me as a threat.
Oh, sure, she does.

Amelia Earhart demonstrates her flying prowess and adventurous spirit.
And now she is set to climb to new heights on her second attempt to cross the Atlantic.
No more a passenger, this time Miss Earhart will do it alone.
Still sleepy?
Well, I'll nap on the way.
Good news about flying solo, no one making noise.
Do you have money?
No.
A whole 20?
I spent our money on ocean liner passage.
Going to bring you back.
It's non-refundable.
Please do your part.
I will.
Well, see you.
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:
Please clear the runway for takeoff.
(WHISPERING) See you.
WEA THERMAN:
Presently all clear over the Atlantic, keeping an eye on a storm system south of the route.
AMELIA:
It was a night of stars, of tropic loveliness.
Stars hung outside my cockpit window near enough to touch.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
If Lindbergh did it, you can do it.
MAN:
No sign of Miss Earhart yet, Mr. Putnam, sir.
If she's on course, the moon should be with her the rest of the way.
Weather updates are coming in every quarter-hour from Kemble.
(ENGINE REVVING)

(WIND WHISTLING)
(GASPS)
NEWSCASTER:
Le Bourget Aéroport, France.
A galaxy of press, well-wishers and ambassadors alike has gathered here in Paris in anticipation of the historic moment when Amelia Earhart will touch down where Lindbergh did years ago.
The world waits with bated breath as Amelia flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
(COUGHING)
(LAUGHS)
-Jimmy, look at that there.
-What do you see?
(LAUGHING)
(EXCLAIMS)
(WHOOPING)
Excuse me, sir.
Where am I?
Uh...
In Gallagher's pasture.
Where are you supposed to be?
When I left, I was aiming for Paris.
Oh.
You missed, you know.
It's over there.
(SHEEP BLEATING)
Well, hello, sheep!
(PHONE RINGS)
(SIGHS) Yes.
MAN:
Miss Earhart has arrived safely, sir.
She's landed in Ireland.
Wonderful.
Wonderful news!
NEWSCASTER:
Journey's end.
Here she is, safe and sound on a farm in Ireland having just completed the first flight by a woman across the Atlantic.
And there's the little plane in which she's broken all records.
Well done.
Well done.
(AMELIA LAUGHING)
(BAND PLAYING SWING MUSIC)
Action!
You're on vacation with Amelia Earhart luggage.
Travel the Nile, moonlight...
I'm sorry, I can't say this.
I try to put the freedom that is flying into my clothes!
Eastman Kodak cameras.
Travel the world, save your memories.
The second person to fly the Atlantic solo,
-and the first one to fly it twice.
-Standing room only, good.
Fourteen hours and 54 minutes.
Are you staying for this?
No, I can't.
I gotta meet the features editor at the Post and then organize that photo shoot for the new luggage line.
What's wrong with you today?
Here I am jumping through hoops like a white horse in the circus.
That's what's wrong.
The only way that we can finance your flying is to make enough money to finance your flying.
...Amelia Earhart!
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Go on out there.
Thank you!
Thank you very much.
GIRL:
Oh.
Please!
Miss Earhart?
An autograph, please.
Miss Earhart, please.
BOY:
Miss Earhart?
-What's your name?
-Gore.
That's an unusual name.
I know.
I don't much like it.
We blame his mother.
She was a Gore, roots going back to colonial times.
Hello.
God, do I have to wade through that?
You will have two Vidal men to protect you.
You'll be fine.
You are so much prettier than your pictures.
Well, thank you, but that...
MAN:
Have you heard from Lindbergh?
What did he say?
"Well done."
Are you gonna write another book?
Yes, if my husband has anything to say about it.
Take my hand.
Come on, Gore.
Let's you and I lead Miss Earhart to safety.
You know, that woman was right.
-Excuse me?
-I felt the same way when I first met you.
You are much prettier than your pictures.
It all seems rather silly considering what's happening out there.
Those men, all those families.
Why have I been given so much?
You've earned the spotlight.
Enjoy it.
You'll be fine.
Just hold on to yourself.
I'm not sure who that is anymore.
She's that girl from Kansas who says "hooey."
(CHUCKLING)
MAN: (ON PA) Distinguished dignitaries from every corner of the world, please rise and welcome Miss Amelia Earhart, honored guest of President Roosevelt and the League of American Pilots.
I'd like to toast a world-class pilot who, at age 15, became the youngest woman in the world to fly solo.
This year, she's recognized as Woman Pilot of the Year.
Here's to Elinor Smith, an inspiration to us all.
(ALL TOASTING)
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT:
Your husband encourages you to fly across the Atlantic.
My husband wouldn't want me to fly to N Street.
So, he hasn't actually forbidden you?
Franklin doesn't forbid.
He just feels it's a waste of my valuable time to learn since I can't afford to buy a plane.
The wrong Roosevelt got elected.
(CHUCKLES)
I did ask about aviation, but he hasn't decided on the structure yet.
It might be under the Bureau of Commerce.
I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it.
I'm sorry, my hearing's failing.
I missed the words "or woman"?
This may be one of those rare instances when the most accomplished candidate turns out to be male.
Is it a name I know?
Gene Vidal.
I love finding the exception that proves the rule.
How do you feel about flying at night?
Whoa!
There we are, ladies and gentlemen, champagne.
Champagne to toast the first lady.
(CHUCKLING)
Put your hands on the wheel!
It's dual controls.
No one'll ever know.
GEORGE:
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to toast to you!
Oh.
Dear God!
(LAUGHING)
Good night.
MRS. ROOSEVELT:
Well, I shall never, ever forget this night.
She seems quite taken with you.
And vice-versa.
Then again, lots of people are quite taken with you.
If you're referring to Gene, as I know you are,
I was able to get a word in for him, to head the Aeronautics Branch.
How did it go?
It's her husband's decision, but I'm hopeful.
Gene is so fortunate to have you in his corner, Amelia.
He'll help me and I'm helping him.
(PLAYING YOU DO SOMETHING TO ME)
You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me Why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me
Transcontinental was too ambitious.
Too many hops, too tough on the ladies.
But the shuttle, Washington, New York, Boston, we think it's the future.
Will you go there with us?
What on earth would you need me for?
(CHUCKLES) You're the most famous woman in America, that's what for.
(CHUCKLING)
You know, I can see it now.
You on the poster with Gene, a legendary athlete at West Point, two events at the Olympics, a top pilot who's gonna be running the skies for Roosevelt when he wins.
Thanks, Paul.
I think you've even talked me out of it.
(LAUGHING)
Do, do that voodoo that you do so well...
May I ask you a question?
May I ask you a question?
That woman over there.
She's beautiful.
You're the only woman I know who points out other beautiful women.
Lovely legs, unlike mine.
No, I'm sure that's not true.
That's why you wear trousers?
No.
And all this while I thought you just wanted to be one of the boys.
I may have, at one time, but not anymore.
MAN:
Was that Amelia Earhart?
GENE:
Sixth floor, please.
(BELL DINGS)
(DOORS OPENING)
Gore!
AMELIA:
I couldn't wait for your visit this weekend.
Lewis.
Lewis.
Help!
Tiger, tiger!
Ah.
The wallpaper.
(LAUGHS)
Coming, Gore.
It's okay.
Do you know why I papered this room like this?
No.
But I wish you hadn't.
It's because I'm very, very afraid of jungles.
So, when I find myself worrying about it,
I test my courage by coming into this room and pretending I'm in the deepest, darkest part of Africa.
In a jungle so thick, I can't even see the sky above.
And I start to feel better right away because I looked my fear right in the face.
Miss Earhart?
Yes?
Could you please marry my father?
Then I'll never be afraid of anything ever again.
Aw.
I'm already married to Mr. Putnam.
Why can't you be married to Mr. Putnam and my father?
I put together one month in Europe.
Had to close some foreign licensing deals, open new markets.
When are you leaving?
Well, the thing is, I'd like you to come.
I don't see how I could.
Well, I've already spoken to the promoters.
They're willing to switch some of the lecture dates, just for us.
Well, it's not just that.
There's my work on the shuttle.
I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
Normally I'd be worried about leaving you here alone, but I suppose that won't be a problem, will it?
What are you trying to say?
(EXHALES TREMULOUSLY)
Gene, here in our house, when I am here, is one thing.
When I am not here,
-I can't have it.
-I understand.
I can't have it.
(MEN SINGING IN LOCAL LANGUAGE)
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
(SIGHS)
I found something you'd written.
Quite beautiful.
"To touch your hand and see your face today is joy.
"Your casual presence in a room recalls the stars
"that watched us as we lay.
"I mark you in the moving crowd and see again those stars
"a warm night lent us long ago.
"We loved so then, we love so now."
Thank you so much for writing that.
(RESTRAINING SOBS) Even though I'd never seen it.
At the time, I...
George?
(SIGHS)
(SLAMS PHONE DOWN)
George.
Thank you.
GENE:
How are you?
I wondered if you were avoiding me a little or...
Just very, very busy.
I'm leaving for Indiana.
Edward Elliott of Purdue wants me to build a Women's Careers Department there.
That's a wonderful idea, especially now.
What's special about now?
You don't read the papers?
Not unless someone makes me.
Well, someone should.
They're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose other than publicity, meaning money.
They also harp on a growing list of products you commercially endorse.
How thoughtless of me to be doing all this in a society where no one else is interested in making money, present company included.
People viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's sweetheart of the skies, the wife, mother, daughter they all wish they'd had, would be helpful.
Thanks for the tip.
Thanks for not being defensive.
I've decided I'm resigning as your consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
The public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together.
And you, of all people, should know that whatever I do,
I do so that I can fly.
And I want to fly that beautiful bird as far as it will take me.
I'm going to fly around the world, Gene.
It can't be done.
Well, I'm going to try.
And I'm going home.
To George.
You can't mean that.
Race you to New York City.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
(GEORGE LAUGHING)
Well, are you going to tell me your surprise, or do I need to be physical?
Boy, that's exactly what I want.
Come on, G.P., tell me.
If you're serious about this flying-around-the-world nonsense, then it might be handy to have a plane to fly in.
Except it would have to be an Electra, and they cost... $36,000, after a generous discount from Lockheed.
It may as well be a billion.
Not to mention at least another $36,000 to have it modified and ready.
And your surprise is you robbed a bank?
No, actually, a university.
I persuaded Ed Elliott to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue.
I suggested a budget amount of $80,000 for a suitable flying laboratory.
The Electra?
Your Electra, Amelia.
George!
(GEORGE LAUGHING)
Well, there is one thing.
The trustees and the donors, they have to be on board also.
Well, that's my job.
I'll do a series of lectures...
No, there will be no more horses, no more hoops, for my Amelia.
Thank you, George.
Even if you don't care if she lives or dies, you know her death will not be a plus for aviation women, or your next campaign.
What if she doesn't die?
What if she just circumnavigates the globe and it's a plus for everyone?
The closest land west of Hawaii is beyond the range of the Electra.
She'll refuel in the air.
She doesn't have the flying skills.
She's taking bigger risks.
Yes.
I'm aware of that.
Don't be so proud of it.
I understand the danger, fellas.
I've studied the route.
What have you come up with?
This is Howland Island.
It's halfway between Honolulu and New Guinea.
It has no elevation, no trees, hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.
It would be almost impossible to spot from the air.
It's really tiny, like a grain of sand in a thousand miles of nowhere.
If you miss this island, you're out of fuel with 2,000 miles to go.
But I'll have Fred Noonan, the best celestial navigator around.
In fact, she's taking Fred along for the whole trip.
Giving up my little arrogance about solo.
Safety first, yes?
You've always had Amelia's best interest at heart.
And for that, we're both grateful.
Stay for supper?
I'd like to, but I'd better be getting back.
Please tell Gore hello for me.
Give him this.
He can track the time zones.
He misses you.
He doesn't understand, really.
Is the new gasket up to spec, Jim?
Everything's good, Miss Earhart.
(DOOR OPENING)
Hello, Fred.
Ma'am.
-Good to see you.
-And you.
Thank you.
Are we sizing me up?
I'm told midair refueling would be beyond my abilities.
You have to put in time, learn the technique.
Even so, 20%, it works, 20%, you crash, 60%, you don't get the fuel, so you're cooked anyway.
Better odds of hitting that island?
How do you feel about 100%?
Even with cloud cover?
Pan Am told you I'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen.
They did.
Someone else told you I got a drinking problem.
Which is a big part of why we're here, right?
Everyone I ever worked for will tell you, nothing's interfered with my performance, not once.
We'd be looking for an island less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet.
That's what you'd be looking for.
I'd be looking for coordinates on a map.
How can I lose?
NEWSCASTER:
Amelia Earhart leaves Oakland for Honolulu, setting out on the most dangerous aeronautic feat ever attempted:
to traverse the waistline of the world.

You know, we've got so much fuel we can't possibly get off the ground.
Much safer than flying.
Well, we'll need enough for a third pass at Howland after you miss it the first couple times around.
Good thinking.

REPORTER 2:
Make sure you get a good shot of their faces!
Turn her up.
Okay, go.
I'll make it good, G.P., I swear to you I will.
I'll make it back and more, I promise.
The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three years.
Maybe.
No, it will, I promise.
Our sales, our prices are going to double.
This just showed them how dangerous it all is.
They were taking it for granted.
They thought I was competent.
Here.
I meant, maybe...
Maybe we can just stop it.
You mean after?
Or even now.
So my exit would be a stupid crash and withdrawing from a world-publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before.
It would ruin us in the bargain.
-Mmm-hmm.
Yes.
-We'd have nothing.
Mmm-hmm.
It's true.
And I'd be fine with that.
(WHISPERING) That's because you're an idiot.
Lucky for you.
(WHISPERING) And what if it's not something I need to show the world?
What if it's something I need to show me?
(WORKERS CHATTERING)
I don't really have a choice, I have to reverse the route.
I'd be facing hurricanes in the Caribbean, monsoons in Africa.
Yeah, but you'll be flying Howland last.
-When I'm most tired.
-Yeah.
So, I just won't get tired.
What's the timetable on the plane?
Three weeks.
She'll be good as new.
We have a remarkable crew here.
-The best that money can...
-Money can buy.
...buy, yeah.
All the money wasted that's never coming back.
You cut the engines.
It would've cost a bundle more to replace a burnt-out plane.
Not to mention a burnt-up pilot.
I overreacted.
The plane was too heavy, I should've used more rudder instead of the throttle.
I...
It's only money.
We'll figure this out.
We always do.
Have you considered, Miss Earhart, that your enthusiasm as a pilot outweighs your ability, as demonstrated by the disaster in Honolulu?
People are saying that you're reckless, a better celebrity than pilot.
Enthusiastic?
Yes.
Reckless?
Not on your life.
I'm a flier pursuing my passion for the fun of it, that's all.
Thank you.
A future flier!

Not while there's still life left in me.
Always ready for a new adventure.

...but heavy rains have temporarily grounded her.
She will push on to Bangkok, then Papua New Guinea before heading east toward her final destination, California.
We should go, Fred.
Oh, come on!
You're not really taking off?
It's only going to get heavier.
We could be stuck here for days, even weeks.
It's only 700 miles to Bangkok, it's lighter there.
To get that far in a monsoon, you'd need divine help!
Chai?
Thank you.
Come on, Fred.
You think we should turn back, huh?
Nope.
I think we shouldn't have come.
Hi, Joan.
Hello, Frances.
You look beat, lady.
That's funny, you look tip-top.
Why don't you grab a few hours of sleep?
Might as well keep you company.
I've got some good flying stories.

Thank you.
Yeah.
You and your old George.
That's a touching love story.
An honest one, if I say so myself.
I wonder if it's honest enough for George.
If you mean Gene, we're not together anymore.
In that way.
Not for a long time.
You don't think I love my husband?
Actually, I do.
In a certain way.
But you disapprove of how I live?
Hell, no.
It's just like me.
In fact, it's like most guys I know.
Meaning?
Guys love their wives, their girlfriends.
Doesn't mean they don't take advantage of an opportunity.
If you have a point, make it.
I believe I have.
All you need to do is just show up tomorrow morning, show up sober, and get me to Howland Island.

Oh, I don't smoke.

You should be working.
I'm running a big adventure here.
I'm a very important fellow.
You told me I was the star and you'd be nearby, a small particle of dust in my constellation.
I thought I was joking.
Guess the joke's on me.
I'll be in Honolulu on the third and with you in Oakland on the Fourth of July, okay?
Don't keep me waiting.
I won't dare.
How's Fred?
On the wagon?
I sent you my movies to lighten the plane.
You wouldn't sell a salesman, would you?
Fred is fine.
He's calculating headwind speed versus fuel as we speak.
So what's that I hear in your voice?
Is he drinking?
I can handle it.
(SIGHS) All right, call it off.
Call it off now.
Right now, Amelia.
I mean it.
Right now.
(SOFTLY) I can handle it.
After the Fourth, we're going home.
Where is that?
For me?
Anywhere you are.
I'm going to like it there.
I'd better, since this is going to be my last flight.
(SOFTLY) If you insist.
I love you.
Should I let you go now?
(WHISPERING) No, never.
I'll go tell the world you're on your way.

Itasca to Earhart, come in, please.
AMELIA:
All the things I never said for so very long, look up, they're in my eyes.
Everyone has oceans to fly.
As long as you have the heart to do it.
Is it reckless?
Maybe.
But what do dreams know of boundaries?
I think about the hands I have held,
the places I've seen,
the vast lands whose dirt is caked on the bottom of my shoes.
The world has changed me.

Engine 2 looks fine.
How's number 1?
Did a compression check.
Engine 1 looks fine.
We love you, Amelia!
Good luck, Amelia!
Miss Earhart, do you really think you'll break the record this time?
She will fly the world's full circumference, 24,902 miles, to travel across the South Atlantic, crossing Africa, over India...
After this 'round-the-world flight, Miss Earhart, are you gonna give up long-distance flying?
Not while there's still life left in me.
I fly for the fun of it.
Good luck!
All right, give us a big smile!
We love you, Amelia!
Thank you.
That's enough.
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.
Mr. Putnam.
The headwinds were stronger than they knew when they took off.
I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them 9%.
9%.
When I saw that little plane, it lifted me above the Kansas prairie.
I had to fly.
My daddy had the wanderlust.
That's why I like to keep moving.
Flying lets me move in 3 dimensions.
Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?
Miss Earhart?
Mr. Putnam will see you now.
Send the papers over this afternoon.
Thank you, bye.
-Miss Earhart?
-Mr.
Putnam?
Please, sit.
I'm told you want to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.
-I do.
-Why do you want to fly?
-Why?
-Why do you want to fly?
Why does a man ride a horse?
Because he wants to, I guess.
3 women have died trying.
2 others have escaped with their lives.
If you do make it, you will be the first, which is the real attraction for both of us, I expect.
Always nice to know what the real attraction is.
The plane was bought from Admiral Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite, who's asked to find an American.
Educated, well-spoken, a flier and preferably physically attractive.
Why would that matter?
Because she wants the world to pay attention.
And pretty girls command more attention.
Was that your advice?
There'll be a contract for the girl's story with The New York Times.
Also a book to be published under her name.
But all the money from this will go to Mrs. Guest.
Except for the part that goes to you.
Well, this is America, and therefore I am obligated to make as much money as I can.
You have a wonderful laugh, Miss Earhart.
You said she wants a flier.
Don't get your hopes up.
The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be pilot.
There will be a male co-pilot who will also serve as navigator.
The woman will be purely a passenger.
Take Lindbergh.
I published his book 3 months after his historic flight.
Must be wonderful to actually know him, to be a friend of his.
Friend?
Good God, no.
Can't stand the man.
He's a stiff-ass, sanctimonious, boring prude.
Was a bestseller though.
Why would anyone want to read a book written by a passenger?
Because the hook is that they're gonna make the woman commander.
The pilot will sign a contract saying he's under your direction and control.
It would be your flight.
My fraud, you mean.
A very distasteful word in book publishing, Miss Earhart.
I don't know, Mr. Putnam.
My dream has always been to fly across the Atlantic, but the way you want me to do it is far from the way I've envisioned it.
Let me be frank.
With your level of flight experience, I wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would normally be considered for this, if a woman were to do any flying at all.
Miss Earhart, let me be painfully clear,
I give the orders and you take them.
And if you do as you're told, you'll be a star.
And I will be nearby, a small particle of dust in your constellation.
Spoken like a gentleman.
Miss Earhart.
Mr. Putnam.
Of course, a gentleman would've paid for my ticket.
What the hell are they?
Oryx!
Look how free they are!
No constraints, no schedules to keep.
For a gal who don't like schedules, you sure got yourself hooked up with the wrong fella in Mr. Putnam.
Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.
Say hello to Slim Gordon, your navigator.
How do you do?
And Bill Stultz,
-the best pilot working today.
-Hello, Bill.
How much fuel do you lose because of these?
Costs us at least 400 gallons.
Well, then why have them?
The owner wants to protect her plane in case you have to ditch it at sea.
But those are decisions I have to make, not somebody else.
They're not making this trip, we are.
But she owns the plane, and this is still America, Miss Earhart.
Ownership is the trump card.
Sad to say, but dollars put planes in the air.
I wonder if it can keep us up there, not that I've ever had enough to try.
Our job is to figure out how to fly this beauty without gasoline.
Include the whole engine up here.
The name is Amelia Earhart.
Careful up there, Slim.
They're leaving for Newfoundland.
Yes, they'll be taking off for there tomorrow, weather permitting.
Make sure the reporters are there.
Goodbye.
Popping-off letters.
For my dad, my mom, and my sis.
You know, in case.
I'm honored that you would leave these with me.
Who else?
If I do pop off, it's your fault.
Pray I make it.
Not much of a prayer man.
Then at least tip your hat and cross your fingers.
Well,
-see you.
-See you.
It's a short hop from Boston to Newfoundland for Amelia Earhart and crew.
Then on to Ireland, and possibly the record books.
Earhart and top-notch ace Bill Stultz have to get airborne, quite a feat once their plane is fully loaded for the Atlantic crossing.
Seems like we got a situation here, a real problem.
When you figure it out, Commander, let us know.
I don't even know what the hell I'm saying anymore.
Here's to Little Miss Earhart, who couldn't lift a pigeon off the ground!
What time is it?
It's time to fly.
Get up, get dressed, we're going now.
Where's the weather report?
It's not good enough.
Great.
Either we fly to Ireland or you're going home today.
Well, it's not good enough.
It's fine.
There's a tailwind all the way.
We'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind will get us to Ireland.
You're dumping fuel?
You're serious?
Just as serious as you're hung-over.
Slim, you go now.
Get the late weather.
We'll meet you at the plane.
Slim, go.
I've got this.
I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill.
He's the most caring and generous and charming and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know.
He's my father.
He's a drunk, and he's let me down all my life.
Now you get out of that goddamn bed, and you fly that plane to Ireland, or I swear to you, I will.
Good.
Slim, start the engines.
This report indicates some degree of risk.
It's a risk I'm taking.
Have a nice flight.
Read tomorrow's papers, Bill!
We'll both be in them.
So, to take off, you pull back on the thing, right?
Go get 'em, Amelia!
Start the clock!
Let's hope this works!
We're up.
We're up.
We're up!
-Good work!
-Well done, Commander!
The fog comes on little cat feet.
It sits, looking over harbor and city, on silent haunches and then moves on.
Listen.
The motors are humming sweetly.
And I feel at home.
You okay?
Be better off if the damn radio would join the party!
Mr. Putnam!
There's a call coming in.
Putnam.
I'm afraid we've lost contact with Miss Earhart's plane, sir.
Keep me informed.
Thank you.
We've been flying for 19 hours plus.
How far to land?
Radio is still out.
There's no way to compute wind speed and drift in the clouds, so God only knows where Ireland is.
There may be an hour of gasoline left.
Probably less.
If we land on the water now, we might have a rescue.
And a failure!
That's out.
Hold on to something, for Christ's sake!
Slim, go help her.
Hang on!
Okay, I'm coming.
Hold on.
Got it.
Take my hand.
-Hang on, Slim!
-Help!
You boys all right?
God!
Land.
Land.
Look.
We got land!
We did it!
We're alive!
Nice work!
Amazing!
Glory, hallelujah!
We made it!
Hello!
-Hello there!
-Hello, young lady!
-Fine young fella.
-Hello!
Hello there, gentlemen.
Hello!
What do you make of that?
Hurry up with it.
You're going to miss it.
Hurry up, man!
Welcome, Miss Earhart!
Miss Earhart!
Morgan, be careful.
That's precious cargo!
There you go, lovely lady.
Watch your step.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Is it Irish tradition to greet newcomers with song?
I couldn't say.
This is Wales!
Bill, look!
Hello, Dorothy.
Are you going to be the next girls to become pilots?
What?
It feels strange.
We haven't had a moment alone.
Just the 2 of us.
Miss Earhart, do you have a statement for the Times?
We're so proud of you!
We love you, Amelia!
Amelia!
Not in the rain!
I flew across the Atlantic!
Hold it right there.
Now, this is a list of the shots they want.
Do you have dirt on your face?
I believe you are referring to my freckles.
-They come with the skin.
-I don't like them.
Very heroic.
Think Lindbergh.
Lady Lindy.
That's what they'll call you.
As I look back on the flight,
I think of 2 questions that have been asked me most frequently:
"Where are you going next?"
and "What did you wear?"
Lucky Strike endorsement.
I wrote the copy myself.
What does it say?
"I don't smoke, but you should"?
No, it says that Lucky Strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship.
Which is true.
I hid them under the seat.
True, maybe, but misleading.
Why would I sign that?
So that Bill and Slim get paid.
Amelia Earhart, the only woman to fly across the Atlantic, just can't keep her feet on the ground.
The publisher George Putnam has commissioned her to write a book on her flying adventures.
-Thanks, fellas!
-You're welcome, Miss Earhart.
You didn't have to come get me.
You do have a dress to change into, I hope.
-Well, it's just a college class, George.
-No, no, no.
No.
You have to take every appearance seriously.
You never know what it might lead to.
Spoken by a man who should know.
What was that for?
Good luck?
What happened to tipping your hat and crossing your fingers?
I'm afraid I'm way beyond that now, like it or not.
I think I like it.
What did your mother say when she knew you flew across the Atlantic?
Well, she sent a telegram congratulating me and then she said the next time she wants to sit beside me in the cockpit.
How did it feel to fly over the ocean?
Were you scared?
When I looked down at the sea, it seemed much like the sky to me.
As if the sky and the sea were the same.
I felt much as I do when I'm flying upward toward the sun.
Transported somehow to a simple, safe, beautiful place, where everything is comprehensible.
Welcome to the Chicago Congress Plaza Hotel.
Good night, Amelia.
Good night.
(MOONGLOW)
It must have been moonglow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow
That led me straight to you
I still hear you...
Dance with me, George.
And I keep on praying
"Oh, Lord, please let this last"
We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs
Seemed to come from everywhere
And now when there's moonglow
Way up in the blue
I'll always remember
That moonglow gave me you
Hello, Elinor.
Mr. Putnam.
Yes, please come in.
Amelia.
Miss Smith.
I've been following your career with a great deal of admiration.
Miss Earhart, you are such an inspiration.
I never get tired of reading about you.
They're saying you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit.
-On a good week.
-On a bad week.
Depends on whether you want the real or the sell.
I don't underestimate the value of selling.
A 16-year-old girl makes headlines illegally flying under the 4 bridges of the East River.
You don't seem to need much help selling yourself.
Actually, Mr. Putnam,
I was hoping you could do to me what you've done to her.
What's your primary ambition?
To take Amelia's place as the number 1 female pilot.
-You want a tip?
-I do.
If I listened to everyone who said it was impossible,
I'd never be flying.
Don't let anyone turn you around.
-You're all here.
-Thank you.
So lovely to see you.
-Hello.
-Good evening.
Good evening, Miss Earhart.
Marvelous party.
Amelia.
This is Gene Vidal.
Amelia Earhart, the aviatrix.
She's a friend of George's.
How do you do, Miss Earhart?
Quite well, Mr. Vidal.
Thank you.
I understand you're writing a book about your transatlantic journey under the tutelage of the master.
Yes.
You enjoying your stay here in Rye?
I must say, I'm a bit out of my element.
The distance between this world and where I come from is as great as the distance between the sun and the moon.
And you believe the whole "opposites attract" theory is...
Pure hooey.
Pure hooey.
-Where are you from?
-Kansas.
"Hooey" is a Kansas word?
Yes, I suppose it is.
Public relations.
It's a new field, entirely new.
It's not publicity, not promotion.
Miss Earhart.
May I call you Amelia?
We may be from different worlds, but we have more in common than you might imagine.
-Is that so?
-Yes.
I'm a teacher, at West Point, true, but still a teacher.
What do you teach?
Flying.
Listen, Amelia...
This is the first time I've ever seen you stumped for a word.
What is it?
Marry me.
-What?
-I want you to marry me.
I don't want to get married, George.
I'm not the marrying kind.
Don't you see you and I embarking on a new life?
Dear George.
Only I can make a fulfilling life for myself.
I don't believe that one can have a fulfilled life alone.
Only when it's shared.
Let me share your life with you.
Let me try to give you whatever you want.
When I was a little girl, for my 7th birthday
my father gave me a globe.
And I'd spend hours just spinning it slowly, reading the names of all those strange, faraway places.
Morocco.
Spain.
Ethiopia.
Dreaming that someday I would go to those places, like a wayfarer,
a traveler, a vagabond.
I want to be free, George.
To be a vagabond of the air.
I'll help you get there.
Thanks.
Hello!
Give me the camera.
I am on my shining adventure, flying the world.
No borders, just horizons.
Only freedom.
Dear G.P.,
You must know again my reluctance to marry, my feeling that I shatter thereby my life in flying, which means so much to me.
In this connection, I may have to keep some place where I can go to be myself now and then, for I cannot guarantee to endure at all the confinements of even an attractive cage.
"In our life together,
"I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me
"nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.
"I must exact a cruel promise.
"And that is, you will let me go in a year
"if we find no happiness together."
Only you, my dear Amelia, could say those brutal words to me
and still have me wanting to be with you.
Forever.
Amelia, do you promise to love, honor and obey this man...
Excuse me, sir?
May we take that back a bit, please?
Love, yes, if it's warranted.
Honor, same thing.
Obey, I can't promise that under any circumstances, but the groom understands that.
Please remove "obey" from the prayer so we can wrap this up before the bride runs off.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Announcing the first Women's Air Derby, racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland.
Yeah, that's fine.
What's this we're hearing?
Advance press release.
The gentlemen who are running the Derby are about to announce the race has to end west of the Rockies.
What?
That's absurd, they're cutting out half the route.
What are they thinking?
They're thinking that it would be bad press when you girls start smashing into the Rocky Mountains.
How dare they?
I'm gonna have a word with these gentlemen.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no.
Come here and walk with me.
I think it would benefit women fliers everywhere if Amelia won the Derby.
You know, the publicity would put the race and all of you up there with the boys.
Well, maybe I'll win the race myself.
Well, you can't win if your plane doesn't pass the final inspection.
And let me predict that it won't.
-Well, that's a threat.
-No.
A prediction.
Amelia's the one who said I shouldn't let anybody turn me around.
Yeah, she probably meant me.
Well, obviously she doesn't see me as a threat.
Sure, she does.
She just doesn't care.
Hey, Gladys!
I let the boys in charge know, in no uncertain terms, we're not changing our route!
We'll sail over those mountains like we're eagles.
I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor.
This is what my loyalty requires.
Lady Lindy herself, Amelia Earhart!
Clear!
Amelia Earhart organizes a competition for women pilots.
9 cities in 9 days.
Tragedy strikes, and there are crashes along the way.
The race continues.
Thousands plan to be on hand to witness those who make it as they approach the finish line.
Here they come, folks.
In 1st place, Louise Haden from Bentonville, Arkansas!
In 2nd place, Gladys O'Donnell from Long Beach, California.
3rd place goes to Amelia Earhart, Atchison, Kansas!
How does it feel to finish 3rd?
A victory for any woman flier is a victory for me.
I'd like to add my congratulations to Louise Haden and announce that we have formed an organization to promote women in aviation.
99 women pilots have applied, so we're calling it The 99s.
And we're going to fly forever!
-George?
-Mom?
-I've been thinking.
-Yes?
I want to fly the Atlantic.
You already have.
As a passenger.
It doesn't count.
I want to fly it solo.
It's been 5 years since Lindbergh.
No one has made it solo.
14 have died trying.
I'll make it.
I know I will.
And if you don't?
I'd rather face a watery grave than go on living as a fraud.
What's wrong with that?
I've been very successful at it.
Amelia Earhart demonstrates her flying prowess and adventurous spirit.
And now she is set to climb to new heights on her 2nd attempt to cross the Atlantic.
No more a passenger, this time Miss Earhart will do it alone.
Still sleepy?
Well, I'll nap on the way.
Good news about flying solo, no one making noise.
Do you have money?
No.
A whole 20?
I spent our money on ocean liner passage.
Going to bring you back.
It's non-refundable.
Please do your part.
I will.
Well, see you.
Please clear the runway for takeoff.
See you.
Presently all clear over the Atlantic, keeping an eye on a storm system south of the route.
It was a night of stars, of tropic loveliness.
Stars hung outside my cockpit window near enough to touch.
If Lindbergh did it, you can do it.
No sign of Miss Earhart yet, Mr. Putnam, sir.
If she's on course, the moon should be with her the rest of the way.
Weather updates are coming in every quarter-hour from Kemble.
Le Bourget Airport, France.
A galaxy of press, well-wishers and ambassadors alike has gathered here in Paris in anticipation of the historic moment when Amelia Earhart will touch down where Lindbergh did years ago.
The world waits with bated breath as Amelia flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
-Jimmy, look at that there.
-What do you see?
Excuse me, sir.
Where am I?
In Gallagher's pasture.
Where are you supposed to be?
When I left, I was aiming for Paris.
You missed, you know.
It's over there.
Well, hello, sheep!
Yes.
Miss Earhart has arrived safely, sir.
She's landed in Ireland.
Wonderful.
Wonderful news!
Journey's end.
Here she is, safe and sound on a farm in Ireland having just completed the first flight by a woman across the Atlantic.
And there's the little plane in which she's broken all records.
Well done.
Well done.
Action!
You're on vacation with Amelia Earhart luggage.
Travel the Nile, moonlight...
I'm sorry, I can't say this.
I try to put the freedom that is flying into my clothes!
Eastman Kodak cameras.
Travel the world, save your memories.
The 2nd person to fly the Atlantic solo,
-and the first one to fly it twice.
-Standing room only, good.
14 hours and 54 minutes.
Are you staying for this?
No, I can't.
I gotta meet the features editor at the Post and then organize that photo shoot for the new luggage line.
What's wrong with you today?
Here I am jumping through hoops like a white horse in the circus.
That's what's wrong.
The only way that we can finance your flying is to make enough money to finance your flying.
...Amelia Earhart!
Go on out there.
Thank you!
Thank you very much.
Please!
Miss Earhart?
An autograph, please.
Miss Earhart, please.
Miss Earhart?
-What's your name?
-Gore.
That's an unusual name.
I know.
I don't much like it.
We blame his mother.
She was a Gore, roots going back to colonial times.
Hello.
God, do I have to wade through that?
You will have 2 Vidal men to protect you.
You'll be fine.
You are so much prettier than your pictures.
Well, thank you, but that...
Have you heard from Lindbergh?
What did he say?
"Well done."
Are you gonna write another book?
Yes, if my husband has anything to say about it.
Take my hand.
Come on, Gore.
Let's you and I lead Miss Earhart to safety.
You know, that woman was right.
-Excuse me?
-I felt the same way when I first met you.
You are much prettier than your pictures.
It all seems rather silly considering what's happening out there.
Those men, all those families.
Why have I been given so much?
You've earned the spotlight.
Enjoy it.
You'll be fine.
Just hold on to yourself.
I'm not sure who that is anymore.
She's that girl from Kansas who says "hooey."
Distinguished dignitaries from every corner of the world, please rise and welcome Miss Amelia Earhart, honored guest of President Roosevelt and the League of American Pilots.
I'd like to toast a world-class pilot who, at age 15, became the youngest woman in the world to fly solo.
This year, she's recognized as Woman Pilot of the Year.
Here's to Elinor Smith, an inspiration to us all.
Your husband encourages you to fly across the Atlantic.
My husband wouldn't want me to fly to N Street.
So, he hasn't actually forbidden you?
Franklin doesn't forbid.
He just feels it's a waste of my valuable time to learn since I can't afford to buy a plane.
The wrong Roosevelt got elected.
I did ask about aviation, but he hasn't decided on the structure yet.
It might be under the Bureau of Commerce.
I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it.
I'm sorry, my hearing's failing.
I missed the words "or woman"?
This may be one of those rare instances when the most accomplished candidate turns out to be male.
Is it a name I know?
Gene Vidal.
I love finding the exception that proves the rule.
How do you feel about flying at night?
There we are, ladies and gentlemen, champagne.
Champagne to toast the first lady.
Put your hands on the wheel!
It's dual controls.
No one'll ever know.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to toast to you!
Dear God!
Good night.
Well, I shall never, ever forget this night.
She seems quite taken with you.
And vice-versa.
Then again, lots of people are quite taken with you.
If you're referring to Gene, as I know you are,
I was able to get a word in for him, to head the Aeronautics Branch.
How did it go?
It's her husband's decision, but I'm hopeful.
Gene is so fortunate to have you in his corner, Amelia.
He'll help me and I'm helping him.
(YOU DO SOMETHING TO ME)
You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me Why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me
Transcontinental was too ambitious.
Too many hops, too tough on the ladies.
But the shuttle, Washington, New York, Boston, we think it's the future.
Will you go there with us?
What on earth would you need me for?
You're the most famous woman in America, that's what for.
You know, I can see it now.
You on the poster with Gene, a legendary athlete at West Point,
2 events at the Olympics, a top pilot who's gonna be running the skies for Roosevelt when he wins.
Thanks, Paul.
I think you've even talked me out of it.
Do, do that voodoo that you do so well...
May I ask you a question?
May I ask you a question?
That woman over there.
She's beautiful.
You're the only woman I know who points out other beautiful women.
Lovely legs, unlike mine.
No, I'm sure that's not true.
That's why you wear trousers?
No.
And all this while I thought you just wanted to be one of the boys.
I may have, at one time, but not anymore.
Was that Amelia Earhart?
6th floor, please.
Gore!
I couldn't wait for your visit this weekend.
Lewis.
Lewis.
Help!
Tiger, tiger!
The wallpaper.
Coming, Gore.
It's okay.
Do you know why I papered this room like this?
No.
But I wish you hadn't.
It's because I'm very, very afraid of jungles.
So, when I find myself worrying about it,
I test my courage by coming into this room and pretending I'm in the deepest, darkest part of Africa.
In a jungle so thick, I can 't even see the sky above.
And I start to feel better right away because I looked my fear right in the face.
Miss Earhart?
Yes?
Could you please marry my father?
Then I'll never be afraid of anything ever again.
Aw.
I'm already married to Mr. Putnam.
Why can't you be married to Mr. Putnam and my father?
I put together one month in Europe.
Had to close some foreign licensing deals, open new markets.
When are you leaving?
Well, the thing is, I'd like you to come.
I don't see how I could.
Well, I've already spoken to the promoters.
They're willing to switch some of the lecture dates, just for us.
Well, it's not just that.
There's my work on the shuttle.
I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
Normally I'd be worried about leaving you here alone, but I suppose that won't be a problem, will it?
What are you trying to say?
Gene, here in our house, when I am here, is one thing.
When I am not here,
-I can't have it.
-I understand.
I can't have it.
Hello?
I found something you'd written.
Quite beautiful.
"To touch your hand and see your face today is joy.
"Your casual presence in a room recalls the stars
"that watched us as we lay.
"I mark you in the moving crowd and see again those stars
"a warm night lent us long ago.
"We loved so then, we love so now."
Thank you so much for writing that.
Even though I'd never seen it.
At the time, I...
George?
George.
Thank you.
How are you?
I wondered if you were avoiding me a little or...
Just very, very busy.
I'm leaving for Indiana.
Edward Elliott of Purdue wants me to build a Women's Careers Department there.
That's a wonderful idea, especially now.
What's special about now?
You don't read the papers?
Not unless someone makes me.
Well, someone should.
They're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose other than publicity, meaning money.
They also harp on a growing list of products you commercially endorse.
How thoughtless of me to be doing all this in a society where no one else is interested in making money, present company included.
People viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's sweetheart of the skies, the wife, mother, daughter they all wish they'd had, would be helpful.
Thanks for the tip.
Thanks for not being defensive.
I've decided I'm resigning as your consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
The public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together.
And you, of all people, should know that whatever I do,
I do so that I can fly.
And I want to fly that beautiful bird as far as it will take me.
I'm going to fly around the world, Gene.
It can't be done.
Well, I'm going to try.
And I'm going home.
To George.
You can't mean that.
Race you to New York City.
Well, are you going to tell me your surprise, or do I need to be physical?
Boy, that's exactly what I want.
Come on, G.P., tell me.
If you're serious about this flying-around-the-world nonsense, then it might be handy to have a plane to fly in.
Except it would have to be an Electra, and they cost... $36,000, after a generous discount from Lockheed.
It may as well be a billion.
Not to mention at least another $36,000 to have it modified and ready.
And your surprise is you robbed a bank?
No, actually, a university.
I persuaded Ed Elliott to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue.
I suggested a budget amount of $80,000 for a suitable flying laboratory.
The Electra?
Your Electra, Amelia.
George!
Well, there is one thing.
The trustees and the donors, they have to be on board also.
Well, that's my job.
I'll do a series of lectures...
No, there will be no more horses, no more hoops, for my Amelia.
Thank you, George.
Even if you don't care if she lives or dies, you know her death will not be a plus for aviation women, or your next campaign.
What if she doesn't die?
What if she just circumnavigates the globe and it's a plus for everyone?
The closest land west of Hawaii is beyond the range of the Electra.
She'll refuel in the air.
She doesn't have the flying skills.
She's taking bigger risks.
Yes.
I'm aware of that.
Don't be so proud of it.
I understand the danger, fellas.
I've studied the route.
What have you come up with?
This is Howland Island.
It's halfway between Honolulu and New Guinea.
It has no elevation, no trees, hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.
It would be almost impossible to spot from the air.
It's really tiny, like a grain of sand in a thousand miles of nowhere.
If you miss this island, you're out of fuel with 2,000 miles to go.
But I'll have Fred Noonan, the best celestial navigator around.
In fact, she's taking Fred along for the whole trip.
Giving up my little arrogance about solo.
Safety first, yes?
You've always had Amelia's best interest at heart.
And for that, we're both grateful.
Stay for supper?
I'd like to, but I'd better be getting back.
Please tell Gore hello for me.
Give him this.
He can track the time zones.
He misses you.
He doesn't understand, really.
Is the new gasket up to spec, Jim?
Everything's good, Miss Earhart.
Hello, Fred.
Ma'am.
-Good to see you.
-And you.
Thank you.
Are we sizing me up?
I'm told midair refueling would be beyond my abilities.
You have to put in time, learn the technique.
Even so, 20%, it works, 20%, you crash, 60%, you don't get the fuel, so you're cooked anyway.
Better odds of hitting that island?
How do you feel about 100%?
Even with cloud cover?
Pan Am told you I'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen.
They did.
Someone else told you I got a drinking problem.
Which is a big part of why we're here, right?
Everyone I ever worked for will tell you, nothing's interfered with my performance, not once.
We'd be looking for an island less than 2 miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet.
That's what you'd be looking for.
I'd be looking for coordinates on a map.
How can I lose?
Amelia Earhart leaves Oakland for Honolulu, setting out on the most dangerous aeronautic feat ever attempted:
to traverse the waistline of the world.
How about a smile for the people back in the States?
Miss Earhart, look this way.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Take care of her, Fred.
That's great.
Thanks.
One big 1 for the camera, Miss Amelia!
You know, we've got so much fuel we can't possibly get off the ground.
Much safer than flying.
Well, we'll need enough for a 3rd pass at Howland after you miss it the first couple times around.
Good thinking.
Thank you!
One more, please, Miss Earhart.
Right here, Amelia!
Good luck, Fred!
Good luck, Amelia!
Clear!
No!
You all right?
Good reaction cutting the switch!
You saved our ass!
Come on, Fred!
Right engine, get the right engine!
Hose on there, right underneath.
-We need tetrachloride here.
-Pyrene, pyrene.
Sam, make sure you get a picture of that.
Make sure you get a good shot of their faces!
Turn her up.
Okay, go.
I'll make it good, G.P., I swear to you I will.
I'll make it back and more, I promise.
The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another 3 years.
Maybe.
No, it will, I promise.
Our sales, our prices are going to double.
This just showed them how dangerous it all is.
They were taking it for granted.
They thought I was competent.
Here.
I meant, maybe...
Maybe we can just stop it.
You mean after?
Or even now.
So my exit would be a stupid crash and withdrawing from a world-publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before.
It would ruin us in the bargain.
-Yes.
-We'd have nothing.
It's true.
And I'd be fine with that.
That's because you're an idiot.
Lucky for you.
And what if it's not something I need to show the world?
What if it's something I need to show me?
I don't really have a choice, I have to reverse the route.
I'd be facing hurricanes in the Caribbean, monsoons in Africa.
Yeah, but you'll be flying Howland last.
-When I'm most tired.
-Yeah.
So, I just won't get tired.
What's the timetable on the plane?
3 weeks.
She'll be good as new.
We have a remarkable crew here.
-The best that money can...
-Money can buy.
buy, yeah.
All the money wasted that's never coming back.
You cut the engines.
It would've cost a bundle more to replace a burnt-out plane.
Not to mention a burnt-up pilot.
I overreacted.
The plane was too heavy, I should've used more rudder instead of the throttle.
I...
It's only money.
We'll figure this out.
We always do.
Have you considered, Miss Earhart, that your enthusiasm as a pilot outweighs your ability, as demonstrated by the disaster in Honolulu?
People are saying that you're reckless, a better celebrity than pilot.
Enthusiastic?
Yes.
Reckless?
Not on your life.
I'm a flier pursuing my passion for the fun of it, that's all.
Thank you.
A future flier!
You can do it, Amelia!
Mr. Noonan, over here!
Miss Earhart!
We love you, Amelia!
She will fly the world's full circumference, 24,902 miles, to travel across the South Atlantic, crossing Africa, over India, and across the wide Pacific...
After this 'round-the-world flight, Miss Earhart, are you gonna give up long-distance flying?
Not while there's still life left in me.
Always ready for a new adventure.
Great, great.
Fred, you're on.
Hey, Fred, give us a big smile for the camera!
Come back to me.
Always.
Hurry up, come on!
Hurry up!
Miss Earhart!
Just one more picture, please!
Just one more, please!
Miss Earhart, over here!
Miss Earhart!
See you.
A fairyland of beauty lay below and about me so lovely as to distract a pilot's attention from the task at hand, that of herding a heavy plane out of that great upland saucer and over the mountains that make its rim.
What is this thing?
Whole thing's made of mud.
It's beautiful.
It's like working with you.
Come on, Amelia.
Amelia Earhart has reached Calcutta...
Dad!
Dad!
It's a bulletin!
but heavy rains have temporarily grounded her.
She will push on to Bangkok, then Papua New Guinea before heading east toward her final destination, California.
We should go, Fred.
Come on!
You're not really taking off?
It's only going to get heavier.
We could be stuck here for days, even weeks.
It's only 700 miles to Bangkok, it's lighter there.
To get that far in a monsoon, you'd need divine help!
Chai?
Thank you.
Come on, Fred.
You think we should turn back?
Nope.
I think we shouldn't have come.
Hi, Joan.
Hello, Frances.
You look beat, lady.
That's funny, you look tip-top.
Why don't you grab a few hours of sleep?
Might as well keep you company.
I've got some good flying stories.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You and your old George.
That's a touching love story.
An honest one, if I say so myself.
I wonder if it's honest enough for George.
If you mean Gene, we're not together anymore.
In that way.
Not for a long time.
You don't think I love my husband?
Actually, I do.
In a certain way.
But you disapprove of how I live?
Hell, no.
It's just like me.
In fact, it's like most guys I know.
Meaning?
Guys love their wives, their girlfriends.
Doesn't mean they don't take advantage of an opportunity.
If you have a point, make it.
I believe I have.
All you need to do is just show up tomorrow morning, show up sober, and get me to Howland Island.
Ready, ma'am.
Thank you.
Feel like stepping out for a smoke?
I don't smoke.
Or something?
Earhart here.
Putnam here.
You should be sleeping.
You should be working.
I'm running a big adventure here.
I'm a very important fellow.
You told me I was the star and you'd be nearby, a small particle of dust in my constellation.
I thought I was joking.
Guess the joke's on me.
I'll be in Honolulu on the 3rd and with you in Oakland on the 4th of July, okay?
Don't keep me waiting.
I won't dare.
How's Fred?
On the wagon?
I sent you my movies to lighten the plane.
You wouldn't sell a salesman, would you?
Fred is fine.
He's calculating headwind speed versus fuel as we speak.
So what's that I hear in your voice?
Is he drinking?
I can handle it.
All right, call it off.
Call it off now.
Right now, Amelia.
I mean it.
Right now.
I can handle it.
After the 4th, we're going home.
Where is that?
For me?
Anywhere you are.
I'm going to like it there.
I'd better, since this is going to be my last flight.
If you insist.
I love you.
Should I let you go now?
No, never.
I'll go tell the world you're on your way.
See you, my darling.
See you, my love.
It looks like she's ready to leave.
Might be easier to just shoot me.
Traveling light, is all.
You got room for 180 pounds of asshole?
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
It's fine.
Everything is.
Have you filled the other side?
Not more than a month ago, I was on the other shore of the Pacific, looking westward.
This morning, I look eastward over the Pacific.
In these fast-moving days that have intervened, the whole width of the world has passed behind us except this broad ocean.
I shall be glad when we have the hazards of this navigation behind us.
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.
Mr. Putnam.
The headwinds were stronger than they knew when they took off.
I recalculated the fuel.
It'll cost them 9%.
9%.
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?
Mr. Putnam, I can 't reach them, sir.
I tried voice and Morse Code.
No, forget Morse Code.
They didn't take the receiver.
Just stay with voice.
You'll get them.
At ease, sailor.
The direction finder.
How long has this been left on?
The battery's dead.
Itasca, this is Earhart.
We're about 200 miles out.
Sky overcast.
Over.
That's her, on 3105.
She said "cloudy and overcast."
Itasca, this is Earhart.
Sky overcast.
Over.
We are receiving your signal.
Please acknowledge ours.
What is your position and ETA Howland?
Over.
Itasca, this is Earhart.
Unable to hear you, over.
Earhart, this is Itasca.
Did you receive transmission?
King How Able Queen Queen.
Please acknowledge our signals on key.
Please acknowledge.
Over.
She's having trouble with voice transmission.
Stay with Morse.
Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen.
Been unable to receive you by radio.
Cannot take bearing on you.
If you can hear this, please take bearing on us.
Earhart's signal strength 4.
Please take bearing on us and report in half an hour.
We'll make noise in microphone.
We are about 100 miles out.
Over.
She's got to stay on longer.
On air too briefly, bearing's impossible.
Maybe her Morse receiver's out.
King How Able Queen Queen.
This is Itasca.
Can't take bearing on 3105.
Please send on 500.
Or do you want to take bearing on us?
Over.
Intercom top deck.
Double-check the smoke stack.
O'Hare to top deck.
Top deck, come in.
They should be able to see that for 20 miles at least.
Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen.
We must be on you, but cannot see you.
Fuel is running low.
Been unable to receive you by radio.
We are flying at altitude 1,000 feet.
Over.
We are receiving you and transmitting on 3105 and 500 consistently.
Over.
Itasca, we are circling, but cannot hear you.
Over.
King How Able Queen Queen, this is Itasca.
Your signal is strong.
Are you receiving this?
Over.
Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen.
We received your signal, but unable to take bearing.
Please take bearing on us and answer on 3105 with voice.
Over.
Your signal received okay.
It is impossible to take a bearing on 3105 on your voice.
Send us a longer transmission, please.
Over.
A report has come in from the ship for Mr. Putnam.
God.
Miss Earhart has finally received transmission from Itasca.
Keep us at 7500.
That's her only acknowledgment.
You've got her signal, damn it.
What about the direction finder?
Cipriani reports the battery's dead, sir.
It was left on all night, so we can't track her.
King How Able Queen Queen to Itasca.
Earhart, will you please come in and reply on 500?
We are transmitting constantly on 7500 and we cannot hear you on 500.
Despite constant attempts, the USS Itasca has lost contact with Amelia Earhart.
Come on.
Come on.
King How Able Queen Queen to Itasca.
We are on the position line 157-337.
We are running north and south.
Over.
We hear you.
We hear you.
Are you receiving us?
Earhart, this is Itasca.
Did you receive transmission?
Itasca to Earhart, come in, please.
All the things I never said for so very long, look up, they're in my eyes.
Everyone has oceans to fly.
As long as you have the heart to do it.
Is it reckless?
Maybe.
But what do dreams know of boundaries?
I think about the hands I have held,
the places I've seen,
the vast lands whose dirt is caked on the bottom of my shoes.
The world has changed me.
Did a compression check.
Engine one looks fine.
We love you, Amelia!
Good luck, Amelia!
Miss Earhart, do you really think you'll break the record this time?
She will fly the world's full circumference, 24,902 miles, to travel across the South Atlantic, crossing Africa, over India:
After this 'round-the-world flight, Miss Earhart, are you gonna give up long-distance flying?
Not while there's still life left in me.
I fly for the fun of it.
Good luck!
All right, give us a big smile!
We love you, Amelia!
Thank you.
That's enough.
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.
Mr. Putnam.
The headwinds were stronger than they knew when they took off.
I recalculated the fuel:
Lt'll cost them nine percent:
Nine percent.
When I saw that little plane, it lifted me above the Kansas prairie:
I had to fly:
My daddy had the wanderlust:
That's why I like to keep moving:
Flying lets me move in three dimensions:
Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?
Miss Earhart?
Mr. Putnam will see you now.
Send the papers over this afternoon.
Thank you, bye.
- Miss Earhart?
- Mr. Putnam?
Please, sit.
I'm told you want to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.
- I do.
- Why do you want to fly?
- Why?
- Why do you want to fly?
Why does a man ride a horse?
Because he wants to, I guess.
Three women have died trying.
Two others have escaped with their lives.
If you do make it, you will be the first, which is the real attraction for both of us, I expect.
Always nice to know what the real attraction is.
The plane was bought from Admiral Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite, who's asked to find an American.
Educated, well-spoken, a flier and preferably physically attractive.
Why would that matter?
Because she wants the world to pay attention.
And pretty girls command more attention.
Was that your advice?
There'll be a contract for the girl's story with The New York Times:
Also a book to be published under her name.
But all the money from this will go to Mrs. Guest.
Except for the part that goes to you.
Well, this is America, and therefore I am obligated to make as much money as I can.
You have a wonderful laugh, Miss Earhart.
You said she wants a flier.
Don't get your hopes up.
The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be pilot.
There will be a male co-pilot who will also serve as navigator.
The woman will be purely a passenger.
Take Lindbergh.
I published his book three months after his historic flight.
Must be wonderful to actually know him, to be a friend of his.
Friend?
Good God, no.
Can't stand the man.
He's a stiff-ass, sanctimonious, boring prude.
Was a bestseller though.
Why would anyone want to read a book written by a passenger?
Because the hook is that they're gonna make the woman commander.
The pilot will sign a contract saying he's under your direction and control.
It would be your flight.
My fraud, you mean.
A very distasteful word in book publishing, Miss Earhart.
I don't know, Mr. Putnam.
My dream has always been to fly across the Atlantic, but the way you want me to do it is far from the way I've envisioned it.
Let me be frank.
With your level of flight experience, I wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would normally be considered for this, if a woman were to do any flying at all.
Miss Earhart, let me be painfully clear,
I give the orders and you take them.
And if you do as you're told, you'll be a star.
And I will be nearby, a small particle of dust in your constellation.
Spoken like a gentleman.
Miss Earhart.
Mr. Putnam.
Of course, a gentleman would've paid for my ticket.
What the hell are they?
Oryx!
Look how free they are!
No constraints, no schedules to keep.
For a gal who don't like schedules, you sure got yourself hooked up with the wrong fella in Mr. Putnam.
Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.
Say hello to Slim Gordon, your navigator.
How do you do?
And Bill Stultz,
- the best pilot working today.
- Hello, Bill.
How much fuel do you lose because of these?
Costs us at least 400 gallons.
Well, then why have them?
The owner wants to protect her plane in case you have to ditch it at sea.
But those are decisions I have to make, not somebody else.
They're not making this trip, we are.
But she owns the plane, and this is still America, Miss Earhart.
Ownership is the trump card.
Sad to say, but dollars put planes in the air.
I wonder if it can keep us up there, not that I've ever had enough to try.
Our job is to figure out how to fly this beauty without gasoline.
Include the whole engine up here.
The name is Amelia Earhart.
Careful up there, Slim.
They're leaving for Newfoundland.
Yes, they'll be taking off for there tomorrow, weather permitting.
Make sure the reporters are there.
Goodbye.
Popping-off letters.
For my dad, my mom, and my sis.
You know, in case.
I'm honored that you would leave these with me.
Who else?
If I do pop off, it's your fault.
Pray I make it.
Not much of a prayer man.
Then at least tip your hat and cross your fingers.
Well,
- see you.
- See you.
It's a short hop from Boston to Newfoundland for Amelia Earhart and crew:
Then on to Ireland, and possibly the record books:
Earhart and top-notch ace Bill Stultz have to get airborne, quite a feat once their plane is fully loaded for the Atlantic crossing:
Seems like we got a situation here, a real problem.
When you figure it out, Commander, let us know.
I don't even know what the hell I'm saying anymore.
Here's to Little Miss Earhart, who couldn't lift a pigeon off the ground!
What time is it?
It's time to fly.
Get up, get dressed, we're going now.
Where's the weather report?
It's not good enough.
Great.
Either we fly to Ireland or you're going home today.
Well, it's not good enough.
It's fine.
There's a tailwind all the way.
We'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind will get us to Ireland.
You're dumping fuel?
You're serious?
Just as serious as you're hung-over.
Slim, you go now.
Get the late weather.
We'll meet you at the plane.
Slim, go.
I've got this.
I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill.
He's the most caring and generous and charming and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know.
He's my father.
He's a drunk, and he's let me down all my life.
Now you get out of that goddamn bed, and you fly that plane to Ireland, or I swear to you, I will.
Good.
Slim, start the engines.
This report indicates some degree of risk.
It's a risk I'm taking.
Have a nice flight.
Read tomorrow's papers, Bill!
We'll both be in them.
So, to take off, you pull back on the thing, right?
Go get 'em, Amelia!
Start the clock!
Let's hope this works!
We're up.
We're up.
We're up!
- Good work!
- Well done, Commander!
The fog comes on little cat feet:
It sits, looking over harbor and city, on silent haunches and then moves on:
Listen:
The motors are humming sweetly:
And I feel at home:
You okay?
Be better off if the damn radio would join the party!
Mr. Putnam!
There's a call coming in.
Putnam.
I'm afraid we've lost contact with Miss Earhart's plane, sir:
Keep me informed.
Thank you.
We've been flying for 19 hours plus.
How far to land?
Radio is still out.
There's no way to compute wind speed and drift in the clouds, so God only knows where Ireland is.
There may be an hour of gasoline left.
Probably less.
If we land on the water now, we might have a rescue.
And a failure!
That's out.
Hold on to something, for Christ's sake!
Slim, go help her.
Hang on!
Okay, I'm coming.
Hold on.
Got it.
Take my hand.
- Hang on, Slim!
- Help!
You boys all right?
Oh, God!
Land.
Land.
Look.
We got land!
We did it!
We're alive!
Nice work!
Amazing!
Glory, hallelujah!
We made it!
Hello!
Hello there!
Hello, young lady!
Fine young fella.
Hello!
Hello there, gentlemen.
Hello!
What do you make of that?
Hurry up with it.
You're going to miss it.
Hurry up, man!
Welcome, Miss Earhart!
Miss Earhart!
Morgan, be careful.
That's precious cargo!
There you go, lovely lady.
Watch your step.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Is it Irish tradition to greet newcomers with song?
I couldn't say.
This is Wales!
Bill, look!
Hello, Dorothy.
Are you going to be the next girls to become pilots?
What?
It feels strange.
We haven't had a moment alone.
Just the two of us.
Miss Earhart, do you have a statement for the Times?
We're so proud of you!
We love you, Amelia!
Amelia!
Not in the rain!
I flew across the Atlantic!
Hold it right there.
Now, this is a list of the shots they want.
Do you have dirt on your face?
I believe you are referring to my freckles.
- They come with the skin.
- I don't like them.
Very heroic.
Think Lindbergh.
Lady Lindy.
That's what they'll call you.
As I look back on the flight,
I think of two questions that have been asked me most frequently:
'"Where are you going next?
'"
And '"What did you wear?
'"
Lucky Strike endorsement.
I wrote the copy myself.
What does it say?
"I don't smoke, but you should"?
No, it says that Lucky Strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship:
Which is true.
I hid them under the seat.
True, maybe, but misleading.
Why would I sign that?
So that Bill and Slim get paid.
Amelia Earhart, the only woman to fly across the Atlantic, just can't keep her feet on the ground:
The publisher George Putnam has commissioned her to write a book on her flying adventures:
- Thanks, fellas!
You're welcome, Miss Earhart.
You didn't have to come get me.
You do have a dress to change into, I hope.
- Well, it's just a college class, George.
- No, no, no.
No.
You have to take every appearance seriously.
You never know what it might lead to.
Spoken by a man who should know.
What was that for?
Good luck?
What happened to tipping your hat and crossing your fingers?
Oh, I'm afraid I'm way beyond that now, like it or not.
I think I like it.
What did your mother say when she knew you flew across the Atlantic?
Well, she sent a telegram congratulating me and then she said the next time she wants to sit beside me in the cockpit.
How did it feel to fly over the ocean?
Were you scared?
When I looked down at the sea, it seemed much like the sky to me:
As if the sky and the sea were the same:
I felt much as I do when I'm flying upward toward the sun:
Transported somehow to a simple, safe, beautiful place, where everything is comprehensible:
Welcome to the Chicago Congress Plaza Hotel.
Good night, Amelia.
Good night.
It must have been moonglow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow
That led me straight to you
I still hear you:
Dance with me, George.
And I keep on praying
'"Oh, Lord, please let this last'"
We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs
Seemed to come from everywhere
And now when there's moonglow
Way up in the blue
I'll always remember
That moonglow gave me you
Hello, Elinor.
Mr. Putnam.
Yes, please come in.
Amelia.
Miss Smith.
I've been following your career with a great deal of admiration.
Oh, Miss Earhart, you are such an inspiration.
I never get tired of reading about you.
They're saying you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit.
- On a good week.
- On a bad week.
Depends on whether you want the real or the sell.
Oh, I don't underestimate the value of selling.
A 16-year-old girl makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the East River.
You don't seem to need much help selling yourself.
Actually, Mr. Putnam,
I was hoping you could do to me what you've done to her.
What's your primary ambition?
To take Amelia's place as the number one female pilot.
- You want a tip?
- I do.
If I listened to everyone who said it was impossible,
I'd never be flying.
Don't let anyone turn you around.
You're all here.
Thank you.
So lovely to see you.
- Hello.
Good evening.
Good evening, Miss Earhart.
Marvelous party.
Oh, Amelia.
This is Gene Vidal.
Amelia Earhart, the aviatrix.
She's a friend of George's.
How do you do, Miss Earhart?
Quite well, Mr. Vidal.
Thank you.
I understand you're writing a book about your transatlantic journey under the tutelage of the master.
Yes.
You enjoying your stay here in Rye?
I must say, I'm a bit out of my element.
The distance between this world and where I come from is as great as the distance between the sun and the moon.
And you believe the whole "opposites attract" theory is...
Pure hooey.
- Where are you from?
- Kansas.
"Hooey" is a Kansas word?
Yes, I suppose it is.
Public relations.
It's a new field, entirely new.
It's not publicity, not promotion.
Miss Earhart.
May I call you Amelia?
We may be from different worlds, but we have more in common than you might imagine.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
I'm a teacher, at West Point, true, but still a teacher.
What do you teach?
Flying.
Listen, Amelia...
This is the first time I've ever seen you stumped for a word.
What is it?
Marry me.
- What?
- I want you to marry me.
I don't want to get married, George.
I'm not the marrying kind.
Don't you see you and I embarking on a new life?
Dear George.
Only I can make a fulfilling life for myself.
I don't believe that one can have a fulfilled life alone.
Only when it's shared.
Let me share your life with you.
Let me try to give you whatever you want.
When I was a little girl, for my seventh birthday
my father gave me a globe.
And I'd spend hours just spinning it slowly, reading the names of all those strange, faraway places.
Morocco.
Spain.
Ethiopia.
Dreaming that someday I would go to those places, like a wayfarer,
a traveler, a vagabond.
I want to be free, George.
To be a vagabond of the air.
I'll help you get there.
Thanks.
Hello!
Give me the camera.
I am on my shining adventure, flying the world:
No borders, just horizons:
Only freedom:
Dear G:
P:,
You must know again my reluctance to marry, my feeling that I shatter thereby my life in flying, which means so much to me:
In this connection, I may have to keep some place where I can go to be myself now and then, for I cannot guarantee to endure at all the confinements of even an attractive cage:
"In our life together,
"I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me
"nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.
"I must exact a cruel promise.
"And that is, you will let me go in a year
"if we find no happiness together. "
Only you, my dear Amelia, could say those brutal words to me
and still have me wanting to be with you.
Forever.
Amelia, do you promise to love, honor and obey this man...
Excuse me, sir?
May we take that back a bit, please?
Love, yes, if it's warranted.
Honor, same thing.
Obey, I can't promise that under any circumstances, but the groom understands that.
Please remove "obey" from the prayer so we can wrap this up before the bride runs off.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Announcing the first Women's Air Derby, racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland:
Yeah, that's fine.
What's this we're hearing?
Advance press release.
The gentlemen who are running the Derby are about to announce the race has to end west of the Rockies.
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.
That's absurd, they're cutting out half the route.
What are they thinking?
They're thinking that it would be bad press when you girls start smashing into the Rocky Mountains.
How dare they?
I'm gonna have a word with these gentlemen.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no.
Come here and walk with me.
I think it would benefit women fliers everywhere if Amelia won the Derby.
You know, the publicity would put the race and all of you up there with the boys.
Well, maybe I'll win the race myself.
Well, you can't win if your plane doesn't pass the final inspection.
And let me predict that it won't.
- Well, that's a threat.
- No.
A prediction.
Amelia's the one who said I shouldn't let anybody turn me around.
Yeah, she probably meant me.
Well, obviously she doesn't see me as a threat.
Oh, sure, she does.
She just doesn't care.
Hey, Gladys!
I let the boys in charge know, in no uncertain terms, we're not changing our route!
We'll sail over those mountains like we're eagles.
I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor.
This is what my loyalty requires.
Lady Lindy herself, Amelia Earhart!
Clear!
Amelia Earhart organizes a competition for women pilots:
Nine cities in nine days:
Tragedy strikes, and there are crashes along the way:
The race continues:
Thousands plan to be on hand to witness those who make it as they approach the finish line:
Here they come, folks:
In first place, Louise Thaden from Bentonville, Arkansas!
In second place, Gladys O'Donnell from Long Beach, California:
Third place goes to Amelia Earhart, Atchison, Kansas!
How does it feel to finish third?
A victory for any woman flier is a victory for me.
I'd like to add my congratulations to Louise Thaden and announce that we have formed an organization to promote women in aviation:
Ninety-nine women pilots have applied, so we're calling it The Ninety-Nines:
And we're going to fly forever!
- George?
- Mmm-hmm?
- I've been thinking.
- Yes?
I want to fly the Atlantic.
You already have.
As a passenger.
It doesn't count.
I want to fly it solo.
It's been five years since Lindbergh.
No one has made it solo.
Fourteen have died trying.
I'll make it.
I know I will.
And if you don't?
I'd rather face a watery grave than go on living as a fraud.
What's wrong with that?
I've been very successful at it.
Amelia Earhart demonstrates her flying prowess and adventurous spirit:
And now she is set to climb to new heights on her second attempt to cross the Atlantic:
No more a passenger, this time Miss Earhart will do it alone:
Still sleepy?
Well, I'll nap on the way.
Good news about flying solo, no one making noise.
Do you have money?
No.
A whole 20?
I spent our money on ocean liner passage.
Going to bring you back.
It's non-refundable.
Please do your part.
I will.
Well, see you.
Please clear the runway for takeoff:
See you.
Presently all clear over the Atlantic, keeping an eye on a storm system south of the route:
It was a night of stars, of tropic loveliness:
Stars hung outside my cockpit window near enough to touch:
If Lindbergh did it, you can do it.
No sign of Miss Earhart yet, Mr:
Putnam, sir:
If she's on course, the moon should be with her the rest of the way:
Weather updates are coming in every quarter-hour from Kemble:
Le Bourget Airport, France:
A galaxy of press, well-wishers and ambassadors alike has gathered here in Paris in anticipation of the historic moment when Amelia Earhart will touch down where Lindbergh did years ago:
The world waits with bated breath as Amelia flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean:
- Jimmy, look at that there.
- What do you see?
Excuse me, sir.
Where am I?
Uh...
In Gallagher's pasture.
Where are you supposed to be?
When I left, I was aiming for Paris.
Oh.
You missed, you know.
It's over there.
Well, hello, sheep!
Yes.
Miss Earhart has arrived safely, sir:
She's landed in Ireland:
Wonderful.
Wonderful news!
Journey's end:
Here she is, safe and sound on a farm in Ireland having just completed the first flight by a woman across the Atlantic:
And there's the little plane in which she's broken all records:
Well done.
Well done.
Action!
You're on vacation with Amelia Earhart luggage.
Travel the Nile, moonlight...
I'm sorry, I can't say this.
I try to put the freedom that is flying into my clothes!
Eastman Kodak cameras.
Travel the world, save your memories.
The second person to fly the Atlantic solo,
- and the first one to fly it twice:
- Standing room only, good.
Fourteen hours and 54 minutes:
Are you staying for this?
No, I can't.
I gotta meet the features editor at the Post and then organize that photo shoot for the new luggage line.
What's wrong with you today?
Here I am jumping through hoops like a white horse in the circus.
That's what's wrong.
The only way that we can finance your flying is to make enough money to finance your flying.
:
Amelia Earhart!
Go on out there.
Thank you!
Thank you very much:
Oh.
Please!
Miss Earhart?
An autograph, please.
Miss Earhart, please.
Miss Earhart?
- What's your name?
- Gore.
That's an unusual name.
I know.
I don't much like it.
We blame his mother.
She was a Gore, roots going back to colonial times.
Hello.
God, do I have to wade through that?
You will have two Vidal men to protect you.
You'll be fine.
You are so much prettier than your pictures.
Well, thank you, but that...
Have you heard from Lindbergh?
What did he say?
"Well done. "
Are you gonna write another book?
Yes, if my husband has anything to say about it.
Take my hand.
Come on, Gore.
Let's you and I lead Miss Earhart to safety.
You know, that woman was right.
- Excuse me?
- I felt the same way when I first met you.
You are much prettier than your pictures.
It all seems rather silly considering what's happening out there.
Those men, all those families.
Why have I been given so much?
You've earned the spotlight.
Enjoy it.
You'll be fine.
Just hold on to yourself.
I'm not sure who that is anymore.
She's that girl from Kansas who says "hooey. "
Distinguished dignitaries from every corner of the world, please rise and welcome Miss Amelia Earhart, honored guest of President Roosevelt and the League of American Pilots:
I'd like to toast a world-class pilot who, at age 15, became the youngest woman in the world to fly solo.
This year, she's recognized as Woman Pilot of the Year.
Here's to Elinor Smith, an inspiration to us all.
Your husband encourages you to fly across the Atlantic.
My husband wouldn't want me to fly to N Street.
So, he hasn't actually forbidden you?
Franklin doesn't forbid.
He just feels it's a waste of my valuable time to learn since I can't afford to buy a plane.
The wrong Roosevelt got elected.
I did ask about aviation, but he hasn't decided on the structure yet.
It might be under the Bureau of Commerce.
I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it.
I'm sorry, my hearing's failing.
I missed the words "or woman"?
This may be one of those rare instances when the most accomplished candidate turns out to be male.
Is it a name I know?
Gene Vidal.
I love finding the exception that proves the rule.
How do you feel about flying at night?
Whoa!
There we are, ladies and gentlemen, champagne.
Champagne to toast the first lady.
Put your hands on the wheel!
It's dual controls.
No one'll ever know.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to toast to you!
Oh.
Dear God!
Good night.
Well, I shall never, ever forget this night.
She seems quite taken with you.
And vice-versa.
Then again, lots of people are quite taken with you.
If you're referring to Gene, as I know you are,
I was able to get a word in for him, to head the Aeronautics Branch.
How did it go?
It's her husband's decision, but I'm hopeful.
Gene is so fortunate to have you in his corner, Amelia.
He'll help me and I'm helping him.
You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me Why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me
Transcontinental was too ambitious.
Too many hops, too tough on the ladies.
But the shuttle, Washington, New York, Boston, we think it's the future.
Will you go there with us?
What on earth would you need me for?
You're the most famous woman in America, that's what for.
You know, I can see it now.
You on the poster with Gene, a legendary athlete at West Point, two events at the Olympics, a top pilot who's gonna be running the skies for Roosevelt when he wins.
Thanks, Paul.
I think you've even talked me out of it.
Do, do that voodoo that you do so well:
May I ask you a question?
May I ask you a question?
That woman over there.
She's beautiful.
You're the only woman I know who points out other beautiful women.
Lovely legs, unlike mine.
No, I'm sure that's not true.
That's why you wear trousers?
No.
And all this while I thought you just wanted to be one of the boys.
I may have, at one time, but not anymore.
Was that Amelia Earhart?
Sixth floor, please.
Gore!
I couldn't wait for your visit this weekend.
Lewis.
Lewis.
Help!
Tiger, tiger!
Ah.
The wallpaper.
Coming, Gore.
It's okay.
Do you know why I papered this room like this?
No.
But I wish you hadn't.
It's because I'm very, very afraid of jungles.
So, when I find myself worrying about it,
I test my courage by coming into this room and pretending I'm in the deepest, darkest part of Africa.
In a jungle so thick, I can't even see the sky above:
And I start to feel better right away because I looked my fear right in the face.
Miss Earhart?
Yes?
Could you please marry my father?
Then I'll never be afraid of anything ever again.
Aw.
I'm already married to Mr. Putnam.
Why can't you be married to Mr. Putnam and my father?
I put together one month in Europe.
Had to close some foreign licensing deals, open new markets.
When are you leaving?
Well, the thing is, I'd like you to come.
I don't see how I could.
Well, I've already spoken to the promoters.
They're willing to switch some of the lecture dates, just for us.
Well, it's not just that.
There's my work on the shuttle.
I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
Normally I'd be worried about leaving you here alone, but I suppose that won't be a problem, will it?
What are you trying to say?
Gene, here in our house, when I am here, is one thing.
When I am not here,
- I can't have it.
- I understand.
I can't have it.
Hello?
I found something you'd written.
Quite beautiful.
"To touch your hand and see your face today is joy.
'"Your casual presence in a room recalls the stars
"that watched us as we lay.
'"I mark you in the moving crowd and see again those stars
"a warm night lent us long ago.
"We loved so then, we love so now. "
Thank you so much for writing that:
Even though I'd never seen it.
At the time, I...
George?
George.
Thank you.
How are you?
I wondered if you were avoiding me a little or...
Just very, very busy.
I'm leaving for Indiana.
Edward Elliott of Purdue wants me to build a Women's Careers Department there.
That's a wonderful idea, especially now.
What's special about now?
You don't read the papers?
Not unless someone makes me.
Well, someone should.
They're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose other than publicity, meaning money.
They also harp on a growing list of products you commercially endorse.
How thoughtless of me to be doing all this in a society where no one else is interested in making money, present company included.
People viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's sweetheart of the skies, the wife, mother, daughter they all wish they'd had, would be helpful.
Thanks for the tip.
Thanks for not being defensive.
I've decided I'm resigning as your consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.
The public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together.
And you, of all people, should know that whatever I do,
I do so that I can fly.
And I want to fly that beautiful bird as far as it will take me.
I'm going to fly around the world, Gene.
It can't be done.
Well, I'm going to try.
And I'm going home.
To George.
You can't mean that.
Race you to New York City.
Well, are you going to tell me your surprise, or do I need to be physical?
Boy, that's exactly what I want.
Come on, G.P., tell me.
If you're serious about this flying-around-the-world nonsense, then it might be handy to have a plane to fly in.
Except it would have to be an Electra, and they cost... $36,000, after a generous discount from Lockheed.
It may as well be a billion.
Not to mention at least another $36,000 to have it modified and ready.
And your surprise is you robbed a bank?
No, actually, a university.
I persuaded Ed Elliott to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue.
I suggested a budget amount of $80,000 for a suitable flying laboratory.
The Electra?
Your Electra, Amelia.
George!
Well, there is one thing.
The trustees and the donors, they have to be on board also.
Well, that's my job.
I'll do a series of lectures...
No, there will be no more horses, no more hoops, for my Amelia.
Thank you, George.
Even if you don't care if she lives or dies, you know her death will not be a plus for aviation women, or your next campaign.
What if she doesn't die?
What if she just circumnavigates the globe and it's a plus for everyone?
The closest land west of Hawaii is beyond the range of the Electra.
She'll refuel in the air.
She doesn't have the flying skills.
She's taking bigger risks.
Yes.
I'm aware of that.
Don't be so proud of it.
I understand the danger, fellas.
I've studied the route.
What have you come up with?
This is Howland Island.
It's halfway between Honolulu and New Guinea.
It has no elevation, no trees, hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.
It would be almost impossible to spot from the air.
It's really tiny, like a grain of sand in a thousand miles of nowhere.
If you miss this island, you're out of fuel with 2,000 miles to go.
But I'll have Fred Noonan, the best celestial navigator around.
In fact, she's taking Fred along for the whole trip.
Giving up my little arrogance about solo.
Safety first, yes?
You've always had Amelia's best interest at heart.
And for that, we're both grateful.
Stay for supper?
I'd like to, but I'd better be getting back.
Please tell Gore hello for me.
Give him this.
He can track the time zones.
He misses you.
He doesn't understand, really.
Is the new gasket up to spec, Jim?
Everything's good, Miss Earhart.
Hello, Fred.
Ma'am.
- Good to see you.
- And you.
Thank you.
Are we sizing me up?
I'm told midair refueling would be beyond my abilities.
You have to put in time, learn the technique.
Even so, 20%, it works, 20%, you crash, 60%, you don't get the fuel, so you're cooked anyway.
Better odds of hitting that island?
How do you feel about 100%?
Even with cloud cover?
Pan Am told you I'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen.
They did.
Someone else told you I got a drinking problem.
Which is a big part of why we're here, right?
Everyone I ever worked for will tell you, nothing's interfered with my performance, not once.
We'd be looking for an island less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet.
That's what you'd be looking for.
I'd be looking for coordinates on a map.
How can I lose?
Amelia Earhart leaves Oakland for Honolulu, setting out on the most dangerous aeronautic feat ever attempted:
To traverse the waistline of the world:
How about a smile for the people back in the States?
Miss Earhart, look this way.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Take care of her, Fred.
That's great.
Thanks.
One big one for the camera, Miss Amelia!
You know, we've got so much fuel we can't possibly get off the ground.
Much safer than flying.
Well, we'll need enough for a third pass at Howland after you miss it the first couple times around.
Good thinking.
Thank you!
One more, please, Miss Earhart.
Right here, Amelia!
Good luck, Fred!
Good luck, Amelia!
Clear!
No!
You all right?
Good reaction cutting the switch!
You saved our ass!
Come on, Fred!
Right engine, get the right engine!
Hose on there, right underneath.
- We need tetrachloride here.
- Pyrene, pyrene.
Sam, make sure you get a picture of that.
Make sure you get a good shot of their faces!
Turn her up.
Okay, go.
I'll make it good, G.P., I swear to you I will.
I'll make it back and more, I promise.
The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three years.
Maybe.
No, it will, I promise.
Our sales, our prices are going to double.
This just showed them how dangerous it all is.
They were taking it for granted.
They thought I was competent.
Here.
I meant, maybe...
Maybe we can just stop it.
You mean after?
Or even now.
So my exit would be a stupid crash and withdrawing from a world-publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before.
It would ruin us in the bargain.
- Mmm-hmm.
Yes.
- We'd have nothing.
Mmm-hmm.
It's true.
And I'd be fine with that.
That's because you're an idiot.
Lucky for you.
And what if it's not something I need to show the world?
What if it's something I need to show me?
I don't really have a choice, I have to reverse the route.
I'd be facing hurricanes in the Caribbean, monsoons in Africa.
Yeah, but you'll be flying Howland last.
- When I'm most tired.
- Yeah.
So, I just won't get tired.
What's the timetable on the plane?
Three weeks.
She'll be good as new.
We have a remarkable crew here.
- The best that money can...
- Money can buy.
...buy, yeah.
All the money wasted that's never coming back.
You cut the engines.
It would've cost a bundle more to replace a burnt-out plane.
Not to mention a burnt-up pilot.
I overreacted.
The plane was too heavy, I should've used more rudder instead of the throttle.
I...
It's only money.
We'll figure this out.
We always do.
Have you considered, Miss Earhart, that your enthusiasm as a pilot outweighs your ability, as demonstrated by the disaster in Honolulu?
People are saying that you're reckless, a better celebrity than pilot.
Enthusiastic?
Yes.
Reckless?
Not on your life.
I'm a flier pursuing my passion for the fun of it, that's all.
Thank you.
A future flier!
You can do it, Amelia!
Mr. Noonan, over here!
Miss Earhart!
We love you, Amelia!
She will fly the world's full circumference, 24,902 miles, to travel across the South Atlantic, crossing Africa, over India, and across the wide Pacific:
After this 'round-the-world flight, Miss Earhart, are you gonna give up long-distance flying?
Not while there's still life left in me.
Always ready for a new adventure.
Great, great.
Fred, you're on.
Hey, Fred, give us a big smile for the camera!
Come back to me.
Always.
Hurry up, come on!
Hurry up!
Miss Earhart!
Just one more picture, please!
Just one more, please!
Miss Earhart, over here!
Miss Earhart!
See you.
A fairyland of beauty lay below and about me so lovely as to distract a pilot's attention from the task at hand, that of herding a heavy plane out of that great upland saucer and over the mountains that make its rim:
What is this thing, huh?
Whole thing's made of mud.
It's beautiful.
It's like working with you.
Come on, Amelia.
Amelia Earhart has reached Calcutta:
Dad!
Dad!
It's a bulletin!
:
But heavy rains have temporarily grounded her:
She will push on to Bangkok, then Papua New Guinea before heading east toward her final destination, California:
We should go, Fred.
Oh, come on!
You're not really taking off?
It's only going to get heavier.
We could be stuck here for days, even weeks.
It's only 700 miles to Bangkok, it's lighter there.
To get that far in a monsoon, you'd need divine help!
Chai?
Thank you.
Come on, Fred.
You think we should turn back, huh?
Nope.
I think we shouldn't have come.
Hi, Joan.
Hello, Frances.
You look beat, lady.
That's funny, you look tip-top.
Why don't you grab a few hours of sleep?
Might as well keep you company.
I've got some good flying stories.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You and your old George.
That's a touching love story.
An honest one, if I say so myself.
I wonder if it's honest enough for George.
If you mean Gene, we're not together anymore.
In that way.
Not for a long time.
You don't think I love my husband?
Actually, I do.
In a certain way.
But you disapprove of how I live?
Hell, no.
It's just like me.
In fact, it's like most guys I know.
Meaning?
Guys love their wives, their girlfriends.
Doesn't mean they don't take advantage of an opportunity.
If you have a point, make it.
I believe I have.
All you need to do is just show up tomorrow morning, show up sober, and get me to Howland Island.
Ready, ma'am.
Thank you.
Feel like stepping out for a smoke?
Oh, I don't smoke.
Or something?
Earhart here.
Putnam here:
You should be sleeping.
You should be working.
I'm running a big adventure here.
I'm a very important fellow:
You told me I was the star and you'd be nearby, a small particle of dust in my constellation:
I thought I was joking.
Guess the joke's on me.
I'll be in Honolulu on the third and with you in Oakland on the Fourth of July, okay?
Don't keep me waiting.
I won't dare.
How's Fred?
On the wagon?
I sent you my movies to lighten the plane.
You wouldn't sell a salesman, would you?
Fred is fine.
He's calculating headwind speed versus fuel as we speak.
So what's that I hear in your voice?
Is he drinking?
I can handle it.
All right, call it off.
Call it off now.
Right now, Amelia:
I mean it:
Right now:
I can handle it.
After the Fourth, we're going home.
Where is that?
For me?
Anywhere you are.
I'm going to like it there.
I'd better, since this is going to be my last flight.
If you insist.
I love you.
Should I let you go now?
No, never.
I'll go tell the world you're on your way.
See you, my darling.
See you, my love.
It looks like she's ready to leave.
Might be easier to just shoot me.
Traveling light, is all.
You got room for 180 pounds of asshole?
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
It's fine.
Everything is.
- Have you filled the other side?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not more than a month ago, I was on the other shore of the Pacific, looking westward:
This morning, I look eastward over the Pacific:
In these fast-moving days that have intervened, the whole width of the world has passed behind us except this broad ocean:
I shall be glad when we have the hazards of this navigation behind us:
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.
Mr. Putnam.
The headwinds were stronger than they knew when they took off.
I recalculated the fuel:
Lt'll cost them nine percent:
Nine percent.
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?
Mr:
Putnam, I can't reach them, sir:
I tried voice and Morse Code.
No, forget Morse Code.
They didn't take the receiver.
Just stay with voice.
You'll get them.
At ease, sailor.
The direction finder.
How long has this been left on?
The battery's dead.

All the things I never said for so very long, look up, they're in my eyes:
Everyone has oceans to fly:
As long as you have the heart to do it:
Is it reckless?
Maybe:
But what do dreams know of boundaries?
I think about the hands I have held,
the places I've seen,
the vast lands whose dirt is caked on the bottom of my shoes:
The world has changed me:
English
- US
- SDH
Synchro: mpm
This sucks dick I hate swimming!
Oh, just shut up and give me a hand with this shit.
- What the hell are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?
- I'm hiding the Jet Ski.
- Why are you hiding the Jet Ski?
Because I told Dust...
Look...
I can't talk with your tits hanging out like cabbages.
Just give me a hand with this.
Screw you.
You threw me into the fucking lake, Kenny.
Now, then.
I think your body is awesome.
You got great tits, but I'm concerned about your bill of health.
I'm gonna insist upon you using some sort of protection.
I got a dental dam in the glove compartment of my truck.
- You can just grab that.
- What the fuck's a dental dam?
It's a rubber for your mouth.
It's not that big of a deal, okay?
And besides, it's not just for my protection.
You don't know what shit I got either.
It's Pakistani.
That's what he told me.
How does somebody manage to get ambushed on a Jet Ski?
I don't know, I guess they jumped them and rode off with it.
Yeah, but I mean, it's a lake.
There ain't exactly places to sneak up on somebody from.
- You'd need a scuba gear.
- I don't know.
Or a snorkel, maybe.
- What's he out there doing?
- Actually, I think he's in training for the majors.
Going back to the majors.
All right, boys.
Let's get back in the baseball, okay?
Wayne.
Keep that pistol aimed at the strike zone, because that is where this bad boy's going.
All right.
Fly as I say fly.
Do as I say do.
Master and commander.
And the crowd goes crazy.
- Sixty-eight.
- What did I tell you, man?
Don't read the readout.
That'sy my own private information.
- Why didn't you hit the target?
- Because, Dustin Jr., at the last moment I decided not to.
I decided to go for that birdbath your dad put there.
I'm trying so hard not to be an asshole to you guys, okay?
Just please work with me here.
I'm sorry.
I'm not mad at you guys I'm disappointed with my arm and how it's trying to butt-fuck me back here.
- I hated that birdbath.
- I broke that birdbath for you,
I knew you hated it.
We're the same.
I hate that fucking thing too.
A stork wrapped around a tree branch.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
You know, that's how the plague started back in the day.
It's from a little disgusting birdbath in someone's backyard that rats made sex to birds in it and created a whole-new type of AIDS.
It's important.
One time I was invited to come to social gathering.
I was paid a handsome amount of money and I brought shotgun and a bottle and showed those people the best fucking time they've ever seen.
A humongous part about being a celebrity is cashing in on it, making shitloads of money, having expensive, luxurious things.
That way, in case one day you're not famous, you could still be rich as hell and better than everyone around you.
Wait a second, is that Kenny Powers walking in my showroom.
- Quite possibly
- How are you doing?
- Who am I speaking to here?
- Ashley Schaeffer, BMW.
Damn fine to meet you.
- I take it you own this place.
- I sure do.
That's why my name's on that building.
I thought Ashley Schaeffer was gonna be a woman
I love women I'll take that as a compliment.
Take it as you will.
- I will.
- You should.
I am.
I'm taking it.
- It's a pretty nice showroom.
- Thank you.
We have a lot of pride.
We've done a lot of work lately.
Complete renovations.
We got beautiful cars.
Beautiful surroundings.
Beautiful women.
- Yeah, they are pretty.
- They're my closers.
And they help people who are slightly hesitant to buy cars.
So if you happen to be a man, Ashley over there will suck your dick.
I like how you work.
If you're a woman, Scott will finger you with his penis.
That's the kind of fun and games we have around here.
Oh, you...
You get it done?
That was...
That's not what you do, not in my neighborhood.
That's what we do around here.
- No, that's not...
- That's what we do here.
We're having fun.
It's so good to have you in here.
- Well, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
- Please, do.
I'm an athlete.
But I'm also a businessman.
You got a classy joint here.
And you're trying to lure costumers in with a caveman spinning a sign around.
It's actually...
It's technically an orangutan.
It seems to me an establishment such as this could go for overhaul in the advertising spokesman game.
I'm talking about a real celebrity, not some sign-spinning fucking monkey.
I'm talking about goddamn me in the store, live, uncut, in person.
Bringing in the customers,
- lubing the deals.
- Holy shit!
This must be my goddamn fucking lucky day.
First off, Kenny Powers walks into my showroom and then he says he wants to do personal appearance.
It's goddamn amazing!
Yeah, I got a lot of star power.
I think it would make this night a grand success.
And I think it'll only cost you two grand.
Yeah, I'm gonna pay you 100 bucks.
You sure you don't wanna maybe meet in the middle somewhere?
How about 200 bucks?
- Two hundred bucks to come...
- Two hundred bucks, cash.
- And a blowjob.
- Fuck you man.
Fuck you.
I'm just kidding.
Bring the fucking ape in here.
Good morning, Kenny.
Now, part of becoming a professional athlete is being strong and fit.
Another part is staying strong and fit.
That is a part that I myself am currently involve with.
Example A.
I can stand to lose 4, maybe 5 pounds to get back in practical game condition.
- No shit.
- What did you just say?
Let's do this.
I got my two favorite students here.
They're gonna spot me 252 pounds of pure steel.
Let's pump some iron, bitches.
Take this serious, because you can get hurt if you're not strong enough, okay?
Okay.
Watch, class.
Masculine strength.
Yeah, help me.
Help me out.
Okay.
All right, back up, back up.
Get away.
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck me!
Spot me, goddamn it!
Get it off of me!
Yo, what's happening over here with the babes?
* dance
- A dance?
- Would you like to buy a ticket?
All the profits go toward Phillip's hospital bills.
Who the fuck is Phillip?
He's one of our students here.
He has brain cancer.
- I've never seen that kid.
- "Spina difa", I think it's called.
Whatever the fuck any of that stuff is, I don't know him.
He gets a dance?
No, I'm not going to any depressing shit like that.
Too sensitive.
Kenny, I hate to burst your bubble, but it looks like your name is on the chaperon list.
I don't know anything about a chaperon list.
What is that?
It's right here and it says that you're a teacher supervisor.
Are you asking met to this dance?
I'm not.
I'm just saying that your name is on the chaperon list.
Are you asking me to this dance?
When is this dance?
- It's tonight.
- Tonight?
You mean, tonight, tonight?
Fuck that noise.
I can't do anything tonight I've got some shit set up already.
- What?
- I'm hosting a celebrity event tonight.
- Really?
- I'm getting paid, like, 15 notes.
Okay, well, if you can't come, you can't come.
Well, you don't have to get upset, I'm sorry I can't go the dance with you.
Guess you'll have to chalk this up to another heartbreak.
Just like back in high school.
How much will you give me if I slam*** the***
- into the trashcan?
- Nothing.
- D
- Ball, what are you doing, man?
- Goddamn it, I'm brushing my teeth.
I need you to give me a ride.
- What's wrong with your truck?
- Nothing.
I need you to drive me.
Why?
Well, Schaeffer BMW is gonna pay me a shit-ton of money to make a little celebrity appearance tonight.
And, I don't know.
I just felt like it'll be stupid if I drive myself because I'm famous.
All right.
I'll drive you there and you can find your way back.
No, I need you to stay.
That's what drivers do.
They don't just drive you there and then drive off.
If you're gonna do this, you're gonna have to do it the full way.
I might even need you to wear a uniform.
Forget it.
Look, no one's gonna look down on you because you drove yourself.
Now, close the door.
Get the fuck out of here.
What's up with them yellow towels?
Those things are pretty...
Give me that, motherfucker.
I saw your dick.
Give me that toilet paper, Kenny.
Come on, you wanna give me a ride?
You wanna be my personal chauffeur?
- I got enough.
- That's not enough.
I smelled that.
You're gonna need more than that.
You have crossed the line.
Give me the toilet paper now!
Fine.
Turtle-walk your ass out of here.
Thanks for nothing.
- Man, this thing's got some power.
- Don't rev my shit, all right?
I'm trying to be serious,
I don't need you to go all fucking Maverick on me.
All right, it's up here on the left.
- Where?
- Clegg, to the left.
- Where, there?
There?
- The fucking place, Schaeffer BMW.
All right, I got it, I got it.
Fuck you, asshole!
All right, here we are.
Man, this feels good, Clegg.
Did you take one of those black beauties?
The ecstasy?
No, dude.
This is a real job.
It's not like teaching kids.
You can't get fucked up.
What feels good is just this.
Back in the spotlight, man.
Right where I belong.
All right!
Kenny Powers is here, everyone!
Keep going.
Keep going.
Kenny Powers.
That's Kenny Powers.
He doesn't do this all the time.
- Turn around!
Look at them, man.
- How's it going?
Why'd you bring a football?
Shelby's bad boy is back in business, huh?
Oh, yes, he is.
Yes, he is.
Are you nervous or not?
You feel a lot of emotions?
I feel 110 percent.
Ready to move some BMWs tonight!
That's...
That's it.
It's a big night.
What are you gonna go with, your fastball or your cut fastball?
Maybe a forkball?
Maybe just signing some balls instead.
- Signing some balls?
- Yeah.
It's not a microphone.
- It's not a microphone.
- I know.
We're just having fun.
How's it going?
- You ready to get this thing going?
- Let's do it.
- Why don't you throw that on?
- What's this?
That's an Ashley Schaeffer BMW polo.
- Put that on.
- Right now?
Right now.
No offense, but I think the all-black is more indicative of the Kenny Powers rebel persona.
Scott, heads up.
Thank you.
Look, I paid you $200, okay?
I wanna see Ashley Schaeffer BMW on your tit.
All right?
Easy.
I don't play games like that.
This isn't a game.
All right, everybody, who wants to meet Kenny Powers?
- What the fuck is up with you, man?
- Ah, you know me.
- Who am I making this out to?
- Well, Kenny, my name's Kevin Hickman and I want you to know even though your career's hit a real sour patch lately,
I'm still your number-one goshdarn fan, man, 100 percent.
That's great, there you go, sport.
Take a hike.
Actually the thing is, Kenny,
I was wondering if maybe you might burn one down middle for me.
I brought my glove and it'd mean a lot.
Well, obviously I'd love to, you know, do that, but I don't think it would be fair to all the other people...
I think you're underestimating your fan base.
Who in their right mind wouldn't wanna see the Kenny Powers give us a little display of that God-given talent!
- All right!
- Who wouldn't wanna see that?
Well, the thing is, I didn't even warm the old whip up.
I got all this Polynesian sauce all over my fingers for eating these goddamn egg rolls.
I would just hate if I slipped up and put a hole on one of these vehicles.
Nonsense!
Come on, man!
I'm Ashley Schaeffer, I got a whole lot full of goddamn BMWs.
Who the hell wouldn't wanna see you burn a hole through one, right?
The people wanna see it!
Yeah, come on!
- Here we go.
- Take it easy.
Hell with that.
Smoke that fool.
Kenny Powers.
Come on, everyone.
Sorry, sorry.
I can't do it.
Not gonna do it.
I can't do it.
I'll be goddamned if I fork out 200 bucks and I'm flat-out denied a single goddamn pitch.
Throw the damn ball.
Pitch was never part of the deal.
I mean, I'm sorry to be a stickler, but, I throw one to him, next thing I'm at the grocery store, I'm at the bar,
I'm at the titty club and ever dumb motherfucker I pass is asking me to smoke one for him.
And I can't open myself up to that.
If I didn't know better, I'd think Kenny is afraid to throw a baseball.
Come on, it's been that long?
Huh?
No.
Forget your trade?
Come on, it's a simple motion, it's like that.
You got a little tendinitis or something?
Come on.
How about:
Why don't you roll one on the ground,
- pretend like it's a bowling ball?
- How about we just go back and we'll sign the rest of the balls and...
How about you throw the ball?
Come on, these people wanna see a show and I don't wanna be embarrassed.
Well, you're doing a good job of that on your own
- just by how you fucking look.
- I thought you were a baseball pitcher.
- You know...
- I thought you were a ball player.
- I am a ball player.
- Are you?
- I'm not a goddamn ape.
- Really?
- So far I don't believe it.
- You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck this, fuck all you people.
Good luck selling these stupid cars.
I'm not helping you.
You know you're not gonna get paid if you walk out of here.
Good Lord.
What are you doing?
What's up?
Dude, it's time to roll!
Come on!
See?
Look, I told you I know him.
Come on!
I gotta go, I gotta go.
Where were you?
I told you to wait in the car.
Why is there silver shit all over your face?
I was hanging out with those dudes in the parking lot.
Doing what?
Giving RoboCop a blowjob?
- Are you crying?
- No!
Do you still have that ecstasy?
He's with me.
Don't bust balls.
My...
My friends are here.
They're...
Fucking awesome!
I'm not gonna get out on that dance floor.
It would be inappropriate.
What is this?
- You're gonna dance with her?
- That's different.
That's how it is?
Okay, come on, come on.
Hey, everybody really turned it out for Phillip tonight, don't you think?
It's a pretty good party.
Pretty...
All right.
- Hi, how are you?
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you had a big event.
- Yeah, I did.
I cancelled it.
I'm not an ape.
I'm a professional ball player.
I need to be around people who understand that.
Are you okay?
Because you're sweating a lot.
I gotta come clean, babe.
There's one image in my life that consistently makes me happy no matter when I think about it, and that image...
That one image is your big tits.
No, listen.
I'm not trying to be crude with you, okay?
This is real.
This is me being honest with you.
- You're inappropriate.
- Love is inappropriate sometimes.
- There are children present.
- What a better place to say my love than surrounded by little angels?
This is about real emotions.
This is about me loving you for real.
And not in a just-to-make-me-cum kind of way.
In a real way.
All right.
If you won't listen to my words, then listen to my dancing feet.
Oh, my.
Work drugs.
A janitor.
Do you think he's okay?
Yeah, I think he just got overheated.
- You doing okay there, Kenny?
- I'm fine.
It was the egg rolls, not the ecstasy.
Okay.
Well, we're gonna get you a ride home, all right?
Well, we raised a lot of money for Phillip tonight, huh?
That was pretty good.
That's right, Stevie.
Everybody's gone, Kenny.
- He was supposed to wait for me.
- Who's that?
My driver.
- You have a driver?
- Of course I do.
I'm famous.
Why don't you come with me?
I'll give you a ride.
I'm going home.
We'll see you Monday.
You look like you could use a friend.
What'd you just say?
You look like you could use a ride.
Well, maybe I could.
- Is that such a crime?
- No, it's not a crime.
I'd give you a ride gladly, Kenny Powers.
Funny thing.
When you're on top of the world, every motherfucker wants to get a piece of your ass.
But then you take a little time off from being unstoppable just to regroup and relax,
no one will to give you the time of fucking day.
This face used to cash fucking checks.
And this dick...
I guess Kenny Powers ain't what he used to be.
No, you...
I can imagine.
I saw you lots on TV.
Your face did cash a lot of checks.
I don't know about the dick, though.
What the fuck is your name again?
Stevie.
It's Stevie Janowski.
All right, Stevie Janowski.
I accept your offer.
Can we go to Ashley Schaeffer BMW first?
Anything you want, Kenny Powers.
Anything at all.
This sucks dick.
I hate swimming.
Oh, just shut up and give me a hand with this shit.
What the hell are you doing?
What does it look like?
-I'm hiding the Jet Ski.
-Why are you hiding the Jet Ski?
Because I told Dustin-- Look, I can't talk with you with your tits hanging out like cabbages.
-Just give me a hand with this.
-Screw you.
You threw me in the fucking lake, Kenny.
Fine.
Now, I think your body is awesome.
You got great tits.
But I'm a little concerned about your bill of health.
I insist upon you using some sort of protection.
Got a dental dam in the glove compartment of my truck.
-You can grab that.
-What the fuck's a dental dam?
A rubber for your mouth.
It's not that big of a deal, okay?
And besides, it's not just for my protection.

-That's what he told me.
-Whoa.
How does somebody manage to get ambushed on a Jet Ski?
I don't know.
I guess they jumped them and rode off with it.
Yeah, but I mean, it's a lake.
There ain't exactly places to sneak up on somebody from.
You'd need scuba gear.
-I don't know, Dustin.
-Snorkel, maybe.
What's he out there doing?
Actually, I think he's in training for the majors.
Oh, going back to the majors.
All right, boys.
Let's get back into baseball, okay?
Wayne, keep that pistol aimed at the strike zone because that is where this bad boy's going.
All right.
Fly as I say fly.
Do as I say do.
Master and commander.
And the crowd goes crazy.
-Sixty-eight.
-What did I tell you, man?

I'm not mad at you guys.
I'm just disappointed with my arm and how it's trying to butt-fuck me back here.

Wait a second.
Is Kenny Powers walking around my showroom?
-Quite possibly.
-How are you doing?
-Who am I speaking to?
-Ashley Schaeffer, Ashley Schaeffer BMW.
-Damn fine to meet you.
-Okay.
-I take it you own this place.
-I sure do.
My name's on the goddamn building.

One, two, three.
Okay, yeah, help me.
Help me out.
Okay.
All right, back up, back up.
Get away.
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck me!
Spot me, goddamn it!
Get it off of me!
Yo, what's happening over here with the babes?
-Fall dance.
-Oh, a dance, huh?
Would you like to buy a ticket?
All the profits go toward Phillip's hospital bills.
Who the fuck is Phillip?
He's one of our students here.
He has brain cancer.
-I've never seen that kid.
-"Spina diffia," I think.
Whatever the fuck any of that stuff is, I don't know him.
He gets a dance?
No, I'm not going to any depressing shit like that.
Too sensitive.
Okay, well, Kenny, I hate to burst your bubble but it looks like your name is on the chaperon list.
I don't know anything about a chaperon list.
What is that?
It's right here and it says that you're a teacher supervisor.
Are you asking me to this dance?
No, I'm not.
I'm just saying your name is on the chaperon list.
April, are you asking me to this dance?
No.
When is this dance?
-It's tonight.
-Tonight?
You mean, "tonight" tonight?
Fuck that noise.
I can't do anything tonight.
-I got some shit set up already.
-What?
-I'm hosting this celebrity event tonight.
-Really?
Yeah, I'm getting paid like 15 notes.
Okay, well, if you can't come, you can't come.
You don't have to get upset.
I'm sorry I can't go to the dance with you.
You'll have to chalk this up to another heartbreak, just like back in high school.
How much will y'all give me if I slam-dunk this thing...
-...into the trashcan?
-Nothing.
Nothing.
D-Ball, what are you doing, man?
Goddamn it, Kenny, I'm brushing my teeth.
I need you to give me a ride.
-What's wrong with your truck?
-Nothing.
-I just need you to drive me around.
-Why?
Well, Schaeffer BMW is gonna pay me a shit-ton of money to make a little celebrity appearance tonight.
Yeah.
And, I don't know.
I just feel like it'll be stupid if I drive myself, because I'm famous.
All right.
I'll drive you there and you can find your way back.
I need you to stay the whole time.
That's what drivers do.
Drivers don't drive you there and then drive off.
If you're gonna do this, you have to do it the full way.
-I might even need you to wear a uniform.
-Forget it, Kenny.
No one's gonna look down on you because you drove yourself.
Now, close the door.
Get the fuck out of here.
What's with them yellow towels?
Those are pretty--
Give me that, motherfucker.
I saw your dick.
Give me that toilet paper, Kenny.
Come on, you wanna give me a ride?
Wanna be my personal chauffeur tonight?
-I got enough.
-That's not enough.
I smelled that motherfucker.
You need more.
You have crossed the line.
Give me the toilet paper now.
Fine.
Turtle-walk your ass out of here.
Thanks for nothing.
Kenny!
Kenny!
Man, this thing's got some power.
Don't rev my shit.
I'm trying to do something serious here.
I don't need you going fucking maverick on me.
All right, it's up here on the left.
-Where?
-Clegg, to the left, dude.
-Where?
There?
-The fucking place says Schaeffer BMW.
-Please, go left.
-All right, I got it, I got it.
Fuck you, asshole!
All right, here we are.
Man, this feels good, Clegg.
Did you take one of those black beauties?
The ecstasy?
No, dude.
This is a real job.
It's not like teaching kids.
You can't get fucked up.
What feels good is just this.
Back in the spotlight, man.
Right where I belong.
All right!
Kenny Powers is here, everyone!
Let's hear it.
Let's hear it.
Keep going.
Keep it going.
Kenny Powers.
That's Kenny Powers.
He doesn't do this all the time.
Kenny!
-Turn around.
Look at them, man.
-Hey, how's it going, guys?
Why'd you bring a football?
Shelby's bad boy is back in business, huh?
Oh, yes, he is.
Yes, he is.
Are you nervous tonight?
You feel a lot of emotions?
I feel 1 10 percent.
Ready to move some BMWs tonight!
That's it.
It's a big night.
What are you gonna go with your fastball or your cut fastball?
Maybe a forkball?
Maybe just signing some balls instead.
-Signing some balls?
-Yeah.
It's not a microphone.
-It's not a microphone.
-I know.
We're just having fun.
Come on.
-How's it going?
-You ready to get this thing going?
-Let's do it.
-Yeah.
Scott.
Why don't you throw that on?
-What's this?
-That's an Ashley Schaeffer BMW polo.
-Put that on.
-Right now?
Yeah, right now.
No offense, but I kind of think the all-black is more indicative of the Kenny Powers rebel persona.
Scott, heads up.
Thank you.
Look, I paid you $200, okay?
I wanna see Ashley Schaeffer BMW on your tit.
-All right?
-Whoa!
Easy.
I don't play games like that.
This isn't a game.
All right, everybody, who wants to meet Kenny Powers?
Kenny Powers.
What the fuck is up with you, man?
You know me.
Who am I making this shit out to?
Well, Kenny, my name's Kevin Hickman and I want you to know even though your career's hit a real sour patch lately I'm still your number one goshdarn fan, man, 100 percent.
That's great.
There you go, sport.
Take a hike.
Well, actually, the thing is, Kenny I was wondering if maybe you might burn one down the middle for me.
I brought my glove and it'd mean a lot.
Well, obviously, I'd love to, you know, do that but I don't think it would be fair to the other people--
Oh, hell, Kenny, come on.
I think you're underestimating your fan base.
I mean, who in their right mind wouldn't wanna see the Kenny Powers give us a little display of that God-given talent?
-All right!
-Who wouldn't wanna see that?
Well, the thing is, you know, I didn't even warm the old whip up.
I got Polynesian sauce all over my fingers from eating these goddamn egg rolls.
I'd hate if I slipped up and put a hole in one of these top-of-the-line vehicles.
Nonsense!
Come on, man!
I'm Ashley Schaeffer.
I got a whole lot full of goddamn BMWs.
Who wouldn't wanna see you burn a hole through one, right?
-Yeah!
-The people wanna see it!
Yeah!
Yeah, come on!
-Here we go, okay?
-Take it easy on me.
Hell with that.
Smoke that fool.
It's Kenny Powers.
Come on, everyone.
-Come on.
-Go on.
Sorry, sorry.
I can't do it.
Not gonna do it.
Can't do it.
I'll be goddamned if I fork out 200 bucks and I'm flat-out denied a single goddamn pitch.
Throw the damn ball.
Pitch was never part of the deal.
I'm sorry to be a stickler but I throw one to him, next thing you know I'm at the grocery store, the bar, the titty club and every fucker I pass is asking me to smoke one.
I can't open myself up to that.
If I didn't know any better, I'd think Kenny Powers is afraid to throw a baseball.
Come on, it's been that long, huh?
-No.
-Forget your trade?
Come on, it's a simple motion, just like that.
You got a little tendinitis or something?
Come on.
How about this:
Roll it on the ground, pretend like it's a bowling ball?
No, how about we just go back and we'll sign the rest of the balls--?
How about you throw the ball, all right?
Come on.
These people wanna see a show and I don't wanna be embarrassed.
Well, you're doing a good job of that on your own just by how you fucking look.
I thought you were a baseball pitcher.
-Know what--?
-Thought you were a ball player.
-I am a ball player.
-Are you?
-I'm not a goddamn ape.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I'm not--
-So far, I don't believe it.
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck this, fuck all you people.
Good luck selling these stupid fucking cars.
I'm not helping you.
Hey, hey, hey.
You know you're not gonna get paid if you walk out of here.
Good Lord.
You're a loser.
You are an ape.
Bye, Kenny.
Bye, Kenny Powers.
Bye, Kenny.
Hey, fuck you, Kenny!
Clegg!
Clegg!
Clegg!
-Clegg!
-Kenny!
Kenny!
What are you doing?
What's up?
Dude, it's time to roll!
Come on!
See?
Look, I told you I know him.
-Kenny!
-Come on!
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Where were you?
Told you to wait in the car.
Why is there silver shit all over your face?
I was hanging with those dudes in the parking lot.
Doing what?
Giving Robocop a blowjob?
Are you crying?
No!
Do you still have that ecstasy?
He's with me.
Don't bust balls.
My friends are here.
They're--
Fucking awesome!
I'm not gonna get out on that dance floor with you.
It would be inappropriate.
What is this?
Now you're gonna dance with her?
-That's different.
-I see how it is.
-Okay, come on, come on.
-I see how it is.
Hey, everybody really turned it out for Phillip tonight, don't you think?
It's a pretty good party.
Pretty-
- All right.
-Hi, how are you?
-What are you doing here?
-I thought you had a big event.
-Yeah, I did.
I cancelled it.
I'm not an ape.
I'm a professional ball player.
I need to be around people who understand that.
Are you okay?
Because you're sweating a lot.
April, I gotta come clean, babe.
There's one image in my life that consistently makes me happy no matter when I think about it, and that image--
That one image is your big tits.
-Oh, Kenny--!
-No, listen.
I'm not trying to be crude with you.
This is real.
This is me being honest with you.
You're inappropriate.
-Love is inappropriate sometimes.
-There are children present.
What a better place for me to say my love than surrounded by little angels?
This is about real emotions.
This is about me loving you for real.
And not in a "just to make me come" kind of way.
In a real way.
All right.
If you won't listen to my words, then listen to my dancing feet.
Oh, my.
Work, drugs.
Call a janitor.
Do you think he's okay?
Yeah, I think he just got overheated.
-You doing okay there, Kenny?
-I'm fine.
It was the egg rolls, not the ecstasy.
Okay.
Well, we're gonna get you a ride home, all right?
No.
Clegg!
Well, we raised a lot of money for Phillip tonight, huh?
That was pretty good.
That's right, Stevie.
Clegg!
-Clegg.
-Everybody's gone, Kenny.
-He was supposed to wait for me.
-Who's that?
My driver.
You have a driver?
Of course, I do.
I'm famous.
Oh, okay.
Well, why don't you come with me, Kenny?
-I'll give you a ride.
-No.
I'm going home.
Well, see you Monday.
Kenny.
Kenny, stop.
You look like you could use a friend.
What'd you just say?
You look like you could use a ride.
Well, maybe I could.
Is that such a crime?
No, it's not a crime.
I'd give you a ride gladly, Kenny Powers.
Funny thing.
When you're on top of the world every motherfucker wants to get a piece of your ass.
But then you take a little time off from being unstoppable just to regroup and relax no one will give you the time of fucking day.
This face used to cash fucking checks.
And this dick....
I guess Kenny Powers ain't what he used to be.
No, you-
- I can imagine.
I saw you lots on TV.
Your face did cash a lot of checks.
I don't know about the dick, though.
What the fuck is your name again?
Stevie.
It's Stevie Janowski.
All right, Stevie Janowski.
I accept your offer.
Can we go to Ashley Schaeffer BMW first?
Yes.
Anything you want, Kenny Powers.
Anything at all.
This sucks dick.
I hate swimming.
Oh, just shut up and give me a hand with this shit.
What the hell are you doing?
What does it look like?
- I'm hiding the Jet Ski.
- Why are you hiding the Jet Ski?
Because I told Dustin- Look, I can't talk with you with your tits hanging out like cabbages.
- Just give me a hand with this.
- Screw you.
You threw me in the fucking lake, Kenny.
Fine.
Now, I think your body is awesome.
You got great tits.
But I'm a little concerned about your bill of health.
I insist upon you using some sort of protection.
Got a dental dam in the glove compartment of my truck.
- You can grab that.
- What the fuck's a dental dam?
A rubber for your mouth.
It's not that big of a deal, okay?
And besides, it's not just for my protection.
You don't know what shit I got either.
Pakistani?
- That's what he told me.
- Whoa.
How does somebody manage to get ambushed on a Jet Ski?
I don't know.
I guess they jumped them and rode off with it.
Yeah, but I mean, it's a lake.
There ain't exactly places to sneak up on somebody from.
You'd need scuba gear.
- I don't know, Dustin.
- Snorkel, maybe.
What's he out there doing?
Actually, I think he's in training for the majors.
Oh, going back to the majors.
All right, boys.
Let's get back into baseball, okay?
Wayne, keep that pistol aimed at the strike zone because that is where this bad boy's going.
All right.
Fly as I say fly.
Do as I say do.
Master and commander.
And the crowd goes crazy.
- Sixty-eight.
- What did I tell you, man?
Don't read the readout.
That's my own private information.
Why didn't you hit the target?
Because at the last moment, I decided not to.
I decided to go for that birdbath your dad put in there just-
I'm trying so hard not to be an asshole to you guys, okay?
Just please work with me here.
I'm sorry.
I'm not mad at you guys.
I'm just disappointed with my arm and how it's trying to butt-fuck me back here.
- I hated that birdbath.
- I broke that for you.
I knew you hated it.
We're the same.
I hate that thing too.
A stork wrapped around a tree branch.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen before.
You know, that's how the plague started back in the day.
It was from a little disgusting birdbath in someone's backyard that rats made sex to birds in it and created a whole new type of AIDS.
It's important.
One time, I was invited to come to a social gathering.
I was paid a handsome amount of money.
I brought a shotgun and a bottle of Tanqueray and showed them the best time they've ever seen.
A humongous part about being a celebrity is cashing in on it making shitloads of money, having expensive, luxurious things.
That way, in case one day you're not famous you could still be rich as hell and better than everyone around you.
Wait a second.
Is Kenny Powers walking around my showroom?
- Quite possibly.
- How are you doing?
- Who am I speaking to?
- Ashley Schaeffer, Ashley Schaeffer BMW.
- Damn fine to meet you.
- Okay.
- I take it you own this place.
- I sure do.
My name's on the goddamn building.
I thought Ashley Schaeffer was gonna be a woman.
I love women.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Take it as you will.
- I will.
- You should.
I am.
I'm taking it.
- Pretty nice showroom you got.
- Thank you.
We have a lot of pride.
We've done a lot of work lately.
Complete renovations.
We got beautiful cars.
Beautiful surroundings.
- Yeah.
- Beautiful women.
- Oh, yeah.
They are pretty hot, huh?
- They're my closers.
Yeah, they help people who are slightly hesitant to buy cars.
- So if you happen to be a man...
- Yeah.
...Ashley over there will suck your dick.
I like how you work.
If you happen to be a woman Scott will finger you with his penis.
That's the kind of fun and games we have around here.
Oh, you get it done?
Whoa!
Okay.
That's not what you do, not in my neighborhood.
We do around here.
We also do this.
- No, that's not-
- That's what we do here.
- We're having fun.
- Okay.
- It's so good to have you in here.
- I'm gonna cut to the chase.
- Please, do.
- I'm an athlete.
But I'm also a businessman.
- You got a classy joint here.
- Yeah.
And you're trying to lure costumers in with a caveman spinning a sign around.
It's actually technically an orangutan.
Well, just seems to me an establishment such as this could go for an overhaul in the advertising spokesman game.
I'm talking about a real celebrity, not some sign-spinning fucking monkey.
I'm talking about goddamn me in the store live, uncut, in person.
Bringing in the customers, lubing the deals.
Holy shit!
This must be my goddamn fucking lucky day.
First off, Kenny Powers walks into my showroom.
Then he says he wants to do a personal appearance.
It's goddamn amazing!
Yeah.
Yeah, I got a lot of star power.
And I think it would make this night a grand success.
And I think it'll only cost you 2 grand.
Yeah, I'm gonna pay you 100 bucks.
You sure you don't wanna maybe meet in the middle somewhere?
How about 200 bucks?
- Two hundred bucks to come-?
- Two hundred bucks, cash.
And a blowjob.
- Fuck you, man.
- Yeah, okay.
- Fuck you.
- Just kidding.
Hey, guys, bring the fucking ape in here.
Good morning, Kenny.
Now, part of becoming a professional athlete is being strong and fit.
Another part is staying strong and fit.
That is a part that I myself am currently involved with.
Example A:
I can stand to lose four, maybe five pounds to get back in practical game condition.
No shit.
- What did you just say?
- Nothing.
Let's do this.
I got my two favorite students here.
They're gonna spot me 252 pounds of pure steel.
Let's pump some iron, bitches.
Okay.
Take this serious, guys.
You can get hurt if you're not strong enough, okay?
Okay.
Watch, class.
Masculine strength.
One, two, three.
Okay, yeah, help me.
Help me out.
Okay.
All right, back up, back up.
Get away.
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck me!
Spot me, goddamn it!
Get it off of me!
Yo, what's happening over here with the babes?
- Fall dance.
- Oh, a dance, huh?
Would you like to buy a ticket?
All the profits go toward Phillip's hospital bills.
Who the fuck is Phillip?
He's one of our students here.
He has brain cancer.
- I've never seen that kid.
- "Spina diffia," I think.
Whatever the fuck any of that stuff is, I don't know him.
He gets a dance?
No, I'm not going to any depressing shit like that.
Too sensitive.
Okay, well, Kenny, I hate to burst your bubble but it looks like your name is on the chaperon list.
I don't know anything about a chaperon list.
What is that?
It's right here and it says that you're a teacher supervisor.

- Tonight?
You mean, "tonight" tonight?

- Really?
Yeah, I'm getting paid like 15 notes.
Okay, well, if you can't come, you can't come.
You don't have to get upset.
I'm sorry I can't go to the dance with you.
You'll have to chalk this up to another heartbreak, just like back in high school.
How much will y'all give me if I slam-dunk this thing...
-... into the trashcan?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
D
- Ball, what are you doing, man?
Goddamn it, Kenny, I'm brushing my teeth.
I need you to give me a ride.
- What's wrong with your truck?
- Nothing.
- I just need you to drive me around.
- Why?
Well, Schaeffer BMW is gonna pay me a shit-ton of money to make a little celebrity appearance tonight.
Yeah.
And, I don't know.
I just feel like it'll be stupid if I drive myself, because I'm famous.
All right.

All right, here we are.

The ecstasy?
No, dude.
This is a real job.
It's not like teaching kids.
You can't get fucked up.

Back in the spotlight, man.

Hey, hey, hey.
You know you're not gonna get paid if you walk out of here.
Good Lord.
You're a loser.
You are an ape.
Bye, Kenny.
Bye, Kenny Powers.
Bye, Kenny.
Hey, fuck you, Kenny!
Clegg!
Clegg!
Clegg!
- Clegg!
- Kenny!
Kenny!
What are you doing?
What's up?
Dude, it's time to roll!
Come on!
See?
Look, I told you I know him.
- Kenny!
- Come on!
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Where were you?
Told you to wait in the car.
Why is there silver shit all over your face?
I was hanging with those dudes in the parking lot.
Doing what?
Giving Robocop a blowjob?
Are you crying?
No!
Do you still have that ecstasy?
He's with me.
Don't bust balls.
My friends are here.
They're-
Fucking awesome!
I'm not gonna get out on that dance floor with you.
It would be inappropriate.
What is this?
Now you're gonna dance with her?
- That's different.
- I see how it is.
- Okay, come on, come on.
- I see how it is.
Hey, everybody really turned it out for Phillip tonight, don't you think?
It's a pretty good party.
Pretty
- All right.
- Hi, how are you?
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you had a big event.
- Yeah, I did.
I cancelled it.
I'm not an ape.
I'm a professional ball player.
I need to be around people who understand that.
Are you okay?
Because you're sweating a lot.
April, I gotta come clean, babe.
There's one image in my life that consistently makes me happy no matter when I think about it, and that image-
That one image is your big tits.
- Oh, Kenny-!
- No, listen.
I'm not trying to be crude with you.
This is real.
This is me being honest with you.
You're inappropriate.
- Love is inappropriate sometimes.
- There are children present.
What a better place for me to say my love than surrounded by little angels?
This is about real emotions.
This is about me loving you for real.
And not in a "just to make me come" kind of way.
In a real way.
All right.
If you won't listen to my words, then listen to my dancing feet.
Oh, my.
Work, drugs.
Call a janitor.
Do you think he's okay?
Yeah, I think he just got overheated.
- You doing okay there, Kenny?
- I'm fine.
It was the egg rolls, not the ecstasy.
Okay.
Well, we're gonna get you a ride home, all right?
No.
Clegg!
Well, we raised a lot of money for Phillip tonight, huh?
That was pretty good.
That's right, Stevie.
Clegg!
- Clegg.
- Everybody's gone, Kenny.
- He was supposed to wait for me.
- Who's that?
My driver.
You have a driver?
Of course, I do.
I'm famous.
Oh, okay.
Well, why don't you come with me, Kenny?
- I'll give you a ride.
- No.
I'm going home.
Well, see you Monday.
Kenny.
Kenny, stop.
You look like you could use a friend.
What'd you just say?
You look like you could use a ride.
Well, maybe I could.
Is that such a crime?
No, it's not a crime.
I'd give you a ride gladly, Kenny Powers.
Funny thing.
When you're on top of the world every motherfucker wants to get a piece of your ass.
But then you take a little time off from being unstoppable just to regroup and relax no one will give you the time of fucking day.
This face used to cash fucking checks.
And this dick...
I guess Kenny Powers ain't what he used to be.
No, you
- I can imagine.
I saw you lots on TV.
Your face did cash a lot of checks.
I don't know about the dick, though.
What the fuck is your name again?
Stevie.
It's Stevie Janowski.
All right, Stevie Janowski.
I accept your offer.
Can we go to Ashley Schaeffer BMW first?
Yes.
Anything you want, Kenny Powers.
Anything at all.
Synchro: mpm
This sucks dick I hate swimming!
Oh, just shut up and give me a hand with this shit.
- What the hell are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?
- I'm hiding the Jet Ski.
- Why are you hiding the Jet Ski?
Because I told Dust...
Look...
I can't talk with your tits hanging out like cabbages.
Just give me a hand with this.
Screw you.
You threw me into the fucking lake, Kenny.
Now, then.
I think your body is awesome.
You got great tits, but I'm concerned about your bill of health.
I'm gonna insist upon you using some sort of protection.
I got a dental dam in the glove compartment of my truck.
- You can just grab that.
- What the fuck's a dental dam?
It's a rubber for your mouth.
It's not that big of a deal, okay?
And besides, it's not just for my protection.
You don't know what shit I got either.
It's Pakistani.
That's what he told me.
How does somebody manage to get ambushed on a Jet Ski?
I don't know, I guess they jumped them and rode off with it.
Yeah, but I mean, it's a lake.
There ain't exactly places to sneak up on somebody from.
- You'd need a scuba gear.
- I don't know.
Or a snorkel, maybe.
- What's he out there doing?
- Actually, I think he's in training for the majors.
Going back to the majors.
All right, boys.
Let's get back in the baseball, okay?
Wayne.
Keep that pistol aimed at the strike zone, because that is where this bad boy's going.
All right.
Fly as I say fly.
Do as I say do.
Master and commander.
And the crowd goes crazy.
- Sixty-eight.
- What did I tell you, man?
Don't read the readout.
That'sy my own private information.
- Why didn't you hit the target?
- Because, Dustin Jr., at the last moment I decided not to.
I decided to go for that birdbath your dad put there.
I'm trying so hard not to be an asshole to you guys, okay?
Just please work with me here.
I'm sorry.
I'm not mad at you guys I'm disappointed with my arm and how it's trying to butt-fuck me back here.
- I hated that birdbath.
- I broke that birdbath for you,
I knew you hated it.
We're the same.
I hate that fucking thing too.
A stork wrapped around a tree branch.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
You know, that's how the plague started back in the day.
It's from a little disgusting birdbath in someone's backyard that rats made sex to birds in it and created a whole-new type of AIDS.
It's important.
One time I was invited to come to social gathering.
I was paid a handsome amount of money and I brought shotgun and a bottle and showed those people the best fucking time they've ever seen.
A humongous part about being a celebrity is cashing in on it, making shitloads of money, having expensive, luxurious things.
That way, in case one day you're not famous, you could still be rich as hell and better than everyone around you.
Wait a second, is that Kenny Powers walking in my showroom.
- Quite possibly
- How are you doing?
- Who am I speaking to here?
- Ashley Schaeffer, BMW.
Damn fine to meet you.
- I take it you own this place.
- I sure do.
That's why my name's on that building.
I thought Ashley Schaeffer was gonna be a woman
I love women I'll take that as a compliment.
Take it as you will.
- I will.
- You should.
I am.
I'm taking it.
- It's a pretty nice showroom.
- Thank you.
We have a lot of pride.
We've done a lot of work lately.
Complete renovations.
We got beautiful cars.
Beautiful surroundings.
Beautiful women.
- Yeah, they are pretty.
- They're my closers.
And they help people who are slightly hesitant to buy cars.
So if you happen to be a man, Ashley over there will suck your dick.
I like how you work.
If you're a woman, Scott will finger you with his penis.
That's the kind of fun and games we have around here.
Oh, you...
You get it done?
That was...
That's not what you do, not in my neighborhood.
That's what we do around here.
- No, that's not...
- That's what we do here.
We're having fun.
It's so good to have you in here.
- Well, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
- Please, do.
I'm an athlete.
But I'm also a businessman.
You got a classy joint here.
And you're trying to lure costumers in with a caveman spinning a sign around.
It's actually...
It's technically an orangutan.
It seems to me an establishment such as this could go for overhaul in the advertising spokesman game.
I'm talking about a real celebrity, not some sign-spinning fucking monkey.
I'm talking about goddamn me in the store, live, uncut, in person.
Bringing in the customers,
- lubing the deals.
- Holy shit!
This must be my goddamn fucking lucky day.
First off, Kenny Powers walks into my showroom and then he says he wants to do personal appearance.
It's goddamn amazing!
Yeah, I got a lot of star power.
I think it would make this night a grand success.
And I think it'll only cost you two grand.
Yeah, I'm gonna pay you 100 bucks.
You sure you don't wanna maybe meet in the middle somewhere?
How about 200 bucks?
- Two hundred bucks to come...
- Two hundred bucks, cash.
- And a blowjob.
- Fuck you man.
Fuck you.
I'm just kidding.
Bring the fucking ape in here.
Now, part of becoming a professional athlete is being strong and fit.
Another part is staying strong and fit.
That is a part that I myself am currently involve with.
Example A.
I can stand to lose 4, maybe 5 pounds to get back in practical game condition.
- No shit.
- What did you just say?
Let's do this.
I got my two favorite students here.
They're gonna spot me 252 pounds of pure steel.
Let's pump some iron, bitches.
Take this serious, because you can get hurt if you're not strong enough, okay?
Okay.
Watch, class.
Masculine strength.
Yeah, help me.
Help me out.
Okay.
All right, back up, back up.
Get away.
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck me!
Spot me, goddamn it!
Get it off of me!
Yo, what's happening over here with the babes?
* dance
- A dance?
- Would you like to buy a ticket?
All the profits go toward Phillip's hospital bills.
Who the fuck is Phillip?
He's one of our students here.
He has brain cancer.
- I've never seen that kid.
- "Spina difa", I think it's called.
Whatever the fuck any of that stuff is, I don't know him.
He gets a dance?
No, I'm not going to any depressing shit like that.
Too sensitive.
Kenny, I hate to burst your bubble, but it looks like your name is on the chaperon list.
I don't know anything about a chaperon list.
What is that?
It's right here and it says that you're a teacher supervisor.
Are you asking met to this dance?
I'm not.
I'm just saying that your name is on the chaperon list.
Are you asking me to this dance?
When is this dance?
- It's tonight.
- Tonight?
You mean, tonight, tonight?
Fuck that noise.
I can't do anything tonight I've got some shit set up already.
- What?
- I'm hosting a celebrity event tonight.
- Really?
- I'm getting paid, like, 15 notes.
Okay, well, if you can't come, you can't come.
Well, you don't have to get upset, I'm sorry I can't go the dance with you.
Guess you'll have to chalk this up to another heartbreak.
Just like back in high school.
How much will you give me if I slam*** the***
- into the trashcan?
- Nothing.
- D
- Ball, what are you doing, man?
- Goddamn it, I'm brushing my teeth.
I need you to give me a ride.
- What's wrong with your truck?
- Nothing.
I need you to drive me.
Why?
Well, Schaeffer BMW is gonna pay me a shit-ton of money to make a little celebrity appearance tonight.
And, I don't know.
I just felt like it'll be stupid if I drive myself because I'm famous.
All right.
I'll drive you there and you can find your way back.
No, I need you to stay.
That's what drivers do.
They don't just drive you there and then drive off.
If you're gonna do this, you're gonna have to do it the full way.
I might even need you to wear a uniform.
Forget it.
Look, no one's gonna look down on you because you drove yourself.
Now, close the door.
Get the fuck out of here.
What's up with them yellow towels?
Those things are pretty...
Give me that, motherfucker.
I saw your dick.
Give me that toilet paper, Kenny.
Come on, you wanna give me a ride?
You wanna be my personal chauffeur?
- I got enough.
- That's not enough.
I smelled that.
You're gonna need more than that.
You have crossed the line.
Give me the toilet paper now!
Fine.
Turtle-walk your ass out of here.
Thanks for nothing.
- Man, this thing's got some power.
- Don't rev my shit, all right?
I'm trying to be serious,
I don't need you to go all fucking Maverick on me.
All right, it's up here on the left.
- Where?
- Clegg, to the left.
- Where, there?
There?
- The fucking place, Schaeffer BMW.
All right, I got it, I got it.
Fuck you, asshole!
All right, here we are.
Man, this feels good, Clegg.
Did you take one of those black beauties?
The ecstasy?
No, dude.
This is a real job.
It's not like teaching kids.
You can't get fucked up.
What feels good is just this.
Back in the spotlight, man.
Right where I belong.
All right!
Kenny Powers is here, everyone!
Keep going.
Keep going.
Kenny Powers.
That's Kenny Powers.
He doesn't do this all the time.
- Turn around!
Look at them, man.
- How's it going?
Why'd you bring a football?
Shelby's bad boy is back in business, huh?
Oh, yes, he is.
Yes, he is.
Are you nervous or not?
You feel a lot of emotions?
I feel 110 percent.
Ready to move some BMWs tonight!
That's...
That's it.
It's a big night.
What are you gonna go with, your fastball or your cut fastball?
Maybe a forkball?
Maybe just signing some balls instead.
- Signing some balls?
- Yeah.
It's not a microphone.
- It's not a microphone.
- I know.
We're just having fun.
How's it going?
- You ready to get this thing going?
- Let's do it.
- Why don't you throw that on?
- What's this?
That's an Ashley Schaeffer BMW polo.
- Put that on.
- Right now?
Right now.
No offense, but I think the all-black is more indicative of the Kenny Powers rebel persona.
Scott, heads up.
Thank you.
Look, I paid you $200, okay?
I wanna see Ashley Schaeffer BMW on your tit.
All right?
Easy.
I don't play games like that.
This isn't a game.
All right, everybody, who wants to meet Kenny Powers?
- What the fuck is up with you, man?
- Ah, you know me.
- Who am I making this out to?
- Well, Kenny, my name's Kevin Hickman and I want you to know even though your career's hit a real sour patch lately,
I'm still your number-one goshdarn fan, man, 100 percent.
That's great, there you go, sport.
Take a hike.
Actually the thing is, Kenny,
I was wondering if maybe you might burn one down middle for me.
I brought my glove and it'd mean a lot.
Well, obviously I'd love to, you know, do that, but I don't think it would be fair to all the other people...
I think you're underestimating your fan base.
Who in their right mind wouldn't wanna see the Kenny Powers give us a little display of that God-given talent!
- All right!
- Who wouldn't wanna see that?
Well, the thing is, I didn't even warm the old whip up.
I got all this Polynesian sauce all over my fingers for eating these goddamn egg rolls.
I would just hate if I slipped up and put a hole on one of these vehicles.
Nonsense!
Come on, man!
I'm Ashley Schaeffer, I got a whole lot full of goddamn BMWs.
Who the hell wouldn't wanna see you burn a hole through one, right?
The people wanna see it!
Yeah, come on!
- Here we go.
- Take it easy.
Hell with that.
Smoke that fool.
Kenny Powers.
Come on, everyone.
Sorry, sorry.
I can't do it.
Not gonna do it.
I can't do it.
I'll be goddamned if I fork out 200 bucks and I'm flat-out denied a single goddamn pitch.
Throw the damn ball.
Pitch was never part of the deal.
I mean, I'm sorry to be a stickler, but, I throw one to him, next thing I'm at the grocery store, I'm at the bar,
I'm at the titty club and ever dumb motherfucker I pass is asking me to smoke one for him.
And I can't open myself up to that.
If I didn't know better, I'd think Kenny is afraid to throw a baseball.
Come on, it's been that long?
Huh?
No.
Forget your trade?
Come on, it's a simple motion, it's like that.
You got a little tendinitis or something?
Come on.
How about:
Why don't you roll one on the ground,
- pretend like it's a bowling ball?
- How about we just go back and we'll sign the rest of the balls and...
How about you throw the ball?
Come on, these people wanna see a show and I don't wanna be embarrassed.
Well, you're doing a good job of that on your own
- just by how you fucking look.
- I thought you were a baseball pitcher.
- You know...
- I thought you were a ball player.
- I am a ball player.
- Are you?
- I'm not a goddamn ape.
- Really?
- So far I don't believe it.
- You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck this, fuck all you people.
Good luck selling these stupid cars.
I'm not helping you.
You know you're not gonna get paid if you walk out of here.
Good Lord.
What are you doing?
What's up?
Dude, it's time to roll!
Come on!
See?
Look, I told you I know him.
Come on!
I gotta go, I gotta go.
Where were you?
I told you to wait in the car.
Why is there silver shit all over your face?
I was hanging out with those dudes in the parking lot.
Doing what?
Giving RoboCop a blowjob?
- Are you crying?
- No!
Do you still have that ecstasy?
He's with me.
Don't bust balls.
My...
My friends are here.
They're...
Fucking awesome!
I'm not gonna get out on that dance floor.
It would be inappropriate.
What is this?
- You're gonna dance with her?
- That's different.
That's how it is?
Okay, come on, come on.
Hey, everybody really turned it out for Phillip tonight, don't you think?
It's a pretty good party.
Pretty...
All right.
- Hi, how are you?
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you had a big event.
- Yeah, I did.
I cancelled it.
I'm not an ape.
I'm a professional ball player.
I need to be around people who understand that.
Are you okay?
Because you're sweating a lot.
I gotta come clean, babe.
There's one image in my life that consistently makes me happy no matter when I think about it, and that image...
That one image is your big tits.
No, listen.
I'm not trying to be crude with you, okay?
This is real.
This is me being honest with you.
- You're inappropriate.
- Love is inappropriate sometimes.
- There are children present.
- What a better place to say my love than surrounded by little angels?
This is about real emotions.
This is about me loving you for real.
And not in a just-to-make-me-cum kind of way.
In a real way.
All right.
If you won't listen to my words, then listen to my dancing feet.
Oh, my.
Work drugs.
A janitor.
Do you think he's okay?
Yeah, I think he just got overheated.
- You doing okay there, Kenny?
- I'm fine.
It was the egg rolls, not the ecstasy.
Okay.
Well, we're gonna get you a ride home, all right?
Well, we raised a lot of money for Phillip tonight, huh?
That was pretty good.
That's right, Stevie.
Everybody's gone, Kenny.
- He was supposed to wait for me.
- Who's that?
My driver.
- You have a driver?
- Of course I do.
I'm famous.
Why don't you come with me?
I'll give you a ride.
I'm going home.
We'll see you Monday.
You look like you could use a friend.
What'd you just say?
You look like you could use a ride.
Well, maybe I could.
- Is that such a crime?
- No, it's not a crime.
I'd give you a ride gladly, Kenny Powers.

I don't know about the dick, though.
What the fuck is your name again?
Stevie.
It's Stevie Janowski.
All right, Stevie Janowski.
I accept your offer.
Can we go to Ashley Schaeffer BMW first?
Anything you want, Kenny Powers.
Anything at all.
Now, in addition to all the museums and art galleries and other great stuff here in our nation's capital, there's one thing you're gonna love probably more than anything else... the dinosaurs.
This way.
Stick together.
Agent Bering?
- Hi, Chet Greenfield.
- Hello.
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.
My assistant said you double-checked everything yesterday.
I did, but I'd like to run a full review before we lock it down.
Sure.
- With you.
- Me?
You're the boss.
I'd like to avoid any chain-of-command confusion.
I tell you, and it gets done.
- Shall we start in the main hall?
- Well, I understand,
- but I'm pretty booked upright now.
- I apologize for the inconvenience.
- I'll clear my schedule.
- I'd appreciate that, sir.
Good morning, Kacey.
I just figured out who you are.
You're a fireman.
No.
Come on.
You know absolutely everything about me.
Well, that's because you talk a lot.
Gordon, this is agent Bering with the Secret Service.
Gordon Letanik?
And what's...
What's this?
An Aztec blood stone.
The boss of virgin sacrifices.
Handsome devil.
I'm just cleaning him for the reception tonight.
Agent Bering wants the group D artifacts moved to the west wall.
They're blocking an exit.
Lose Tuvalu and Malta.
Move Britain to the back.
If it still doesn't fit, see me and we'll cut something else.
Yes, sir.
I'll just finish up.
What's next?
The main floor bathrooms.
I'll need the plumbing pulled again.
I would try to sneak you in, but the Secret Service will be there, and they can be jerks.
So I've heard.
Call you soon.
You promise?
Promise.
Bye now.
Champagne?
Thank you.
Champagne?
Cham...
Status check on Eagle.
- Who's on Emerald entrance?
- Me.
Morris.
Why aren't you at Emerald?
Well, because I'm here.
- How's Home Base?
- We're calling Home Base "Magenta".
Well, I'm not.
- You changed the protocol.
- I tweaked it.
I wrote it.
And I didn't use colors.
Why weren't you at my briefing?
I was vetting one of the servers.
- Screwing off is more like it.
- Well, you say po-tah-to.
- Get back to Emerald.
- You're not my superior.
Dickinson gave this to me.
I'm running it.
- Meeka.
- Myka.
I get... vibes.
Sorry?
This isn't some run and gun that you're used to in Denver.
- Get to the point, Lattimer.
- Dickinson gave you this shindig with my protocol because my specialty is logistics, framing... and I kid you not, there is something really off in here.
Eagle at Magenta.
Mr. President, wait a moment, please.
This is Bering.
Eagle is free to enter.
Negative, negative.
This is Lattimer.
Hold Eagle at five until further.
- Copy?
- Copy.
Holding Eagle.
Get back to Emerald.
Look, Myka, why don't you pull your head out of your Magenta and feel the room.
- Something's off.
- Listen, Showboat.
Nothing's off.
The room is fine.
Everything is fine.
Now take your vibe... and go.
- Enjoy your party.
- I will.
I want a perimeter check asap.
- Emerald clear.
- Peach clear.
- Orange clear.
- Gold clear.
Crimson clear.
There's...
There's blood, so...
Pete?
- What are you doing here?
- Working.
Is there a fire?
- Excuse me, sir.
Wait just a second.
- Secret Service.
This is...
Gotta go.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
That's an okay for Eagle to enter.
Affirmative.
Clear Eagle.
Freeze!
Drop the knife.
Hold your fire!
Seriously, Gordon, drop the knife.
Drop that.
- Whatever it is.
- Can't do that, Pete.
Weapon.
We're done here.
Tell me you found the guy.
The guy who you said stole the rock?
We're gonna need a sample.
Come on, Dickinson.
Well, you said, among many strange things,
- that the rock was bleeding.
- It was.
Taxpayers will probably wanna know if you were high, paranoid, or just part of an Aztec art theft ring.
In the meantime, you're suspended, with pay, for two weeks, till we get this thing worked out.
- What about Morris?
- He says nothing happened at emerald.
Okay, can we... stop with the colors already?
What about...
the guy with the knife?
- What, Letanik?
- Yes.
He's in a coma.
Docs don't know why or how long that's gonna last.
- And Bering?
- Myka's being thanked personally by the President and the first lady.
- Of course she is.
- She's going places.
You, on the other hand, you're going to the bathroom.
That's funny.
Mr. Lattimer.
My name's Frederic.
Frederic what?
- Mrs. Frederic.
- Well, that's a relief.
I'm with the government.
I'm here on a matter of national security.
- What's that?
- An invitation to endless wonder.
Could you sound a little more creepy?
Read it.
Please note the action code.
It is legitimate.
- You're part of my bailiwick now.
- Your bailiwick?
- You're working for me.
- For you?
- Am I stuttering?
- No, ma'am.
All right, I get it.
It's a... this is a joke, right?
Dickinson put you guys up...
This is Dickinson being funny, right?
Do I look like a joke?
You're to be in South Dakota at those coordinates at noon tomorrow.
You will mention our meeting and your pending assignment to no one.
Is that understood?
How long am I gonna be in South Dakota?
- Indefinitely.
- Indef... no, no.
I've got a life here.
Really?
I've got... things.
Pack light, Mr. Lattimer.
We'll ship what you need and store the rest.
Prepare to turn right in 100 feet.
Turn right now.
You have missed your turn.
Go back.
Turn right.
Destination straight ahead.
You gotta be kidding me.
Endless wonder.
It's agent Lattimer!
I'm here!
Great.
- I heard you were suspended.
- Yeah, I heard that too.
Why are you here?
I was ordered here, last night.
Mrs. Frederic.
Said it was a matter of...
National security.
Right.
How are you guys doing?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to fix the fish.
- Stop right there.
- What are you doing?
This is the guy.
The one from last night.
- The guy who stole the rock.
- You stole the rock.
It's a blood stone.
It's safe.
It's inside the building.
It's the property of the museum.
And that museum is property of the Government, so is the warehouse.
And so am I.
I'm secret service.
I also work for Mrs. Frederic.
I'm Dr. Nielson.
You can call me Artie.
Got some ID?
We take the secret part seriously around here.
I just wanted to thank you for your assist in last night's retrieval.
That was very good.
Did you throw that foot ball at me?
You weren't here when I threw it.
It takes a while to circle back.
Come on inside.
- I'll show you around.
- Around what?
What am I doing here?
I'll explain everything inside.
Come on.
I made cookies.
Come on.
Really, it's okay.
Go inside.
Don't go far!
Okay.
Come on in.
Wait for me at the bottom of the stairs.
It's fine.
Don't touch anything.
Don't touch the bombs.
Hold this.
Hold it.
Come on.
It's okay.
Right this way.
Ms. Bering, Mr. Lattimer, welcome to Warehouse 13.
- I'm thrilled you're on the team.
- What team?
What is this place?
Officially, K-39 triple-Z on the North American grid.
But...
I like to think of it as America's attic.
Projet-SG (1.00)
Pete, close the door.
Tell me exactly what I'm doing here.
Exactly?
That's a little dif...
Well, to put it plainly, you're both joining me as fellow gatherers and protectors of secrets.
Put it plainer.
This...
This warehouse...
Look, the Warehouse needs you.
It needs...
Pete, don't touch.
It needs your combined talents.
He's intuitive, and you're...
You've got a scrupulous eye for detail.
He's scattershot, and you're meticulous.
You look, he leaps.
There's been a mistake.
I'm too valuable to be wasted here.
No offense.
- Of course not.
- Can I use your phone, please?
Mine?
It's broken.
- I have to make a phone call, so...
- There's no signal here.
Yeah, you're...
You're...
Just pull...
Pull the door, and you'll be... now.
There you go.
I think she had other plans.
So did I.
You want juice or are you a milk person?
- You know what I'd really like?
- I do indeed, but falling off the wagon may not be the best option at this point.
- Milk it is.
- Yeah.
- That's Mrs. Frederic.
- Long time ago.
- She looks exactly the same.
- Odd, isn't it?
You don't want a cookie?
- So who are these guys?
- Former colleagues.
And where are they now?
This one and this one are dead.
This one, a mental institution in Germany.
And this last one... disappeared.
One day I'll find him.
Ted, these are two of my best agents.
How can you not know?
I'm looking at the order.
You processed it.
How can't you know?
Hold on.
- Dickinson.
- Sir, it's Myka Bering.
Sir, I have a little situation here.
I'm not sure...
Yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I'm looking at the transfer order.
The name on here is Frederic.
You're transferred to where?
- Where are you?
- I'm in South Dakota.
- Where?
- South Dakota.
- What are you doing in South Dakota?
- You don't know about this?
No.
Who is Frederic?
Sir?
Sir?
- Who's this Frederic?
- Sir!
Yes, yes.
She handed me orders last night to come here to a warehouse in South Dakota.
The order code was solid, and Lattimer's here too.
Look, I'm requesting an immediate stand down and transfer back to DC.
Myka.
Myka, I can't do that, okay?
This order trumps me.
Let me get on this, I'll get you back here asap.
- What should I do?
- Follow orders.
- Those orders, both of you.
- And how long will this take?
Sir?
Sir?
Are you still there?
That's a pile of crap.
- No kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.
You're actually standing in a big pile of cow manure.
- Oatmeal scotchie?
- No.
Thank you.
I don't eat sugar.
Good for you.
Listen...
Please don't think of this assignment, you know, as some sort of punishment.
- Can you hold this?
- What?
You know, yeah, your presence here is not really a reaction to what happened to you in Denver.
So...
I got a commendation for what happened in Denver.
Yes, you did.
It's time for the nickel tour.
Come on.
The order trumps Dickinson?
The first Warehouse 13 was built in '98.
- So we're stuck.
- Until he works out a transfer, yes.
1898.
We didn't have a handle on how to store stuff.
It burned down.
Some remodeling and excavations were necessary as the years went on to accommodate the arrival of more and more and more and more artifacts.
What's stored here, exactly?
This and that.
Bric-a-brac.
Some things along the lines of... last night's rock and roll.
I'm talking about the blood stone.
Both hands... on the bar, please.
I think I'll survive a crash.
No, that's not a safety bar.
It's a conduit.
You and Pete are the power source.
Your combined electrical energy makes this thing move.
It's fine, it's fine.
Look, Thomas Edison built this automobile for Henry Ford as a proof of concept, and it's perfectly safe.
Trust me.
Put your hands on the bar.
Put your hands on the bar.
Thank you.
We need both of you.
Hands on the bar, Myka.
Thank you.
Edison, he wanted Ford to let go of oil, but Ford, no, no, he stuck with it because it ruined his engines faster.
People had to keep buying them.
- What is that?
- What?
That is training flight 22.
We pulled that from the Bermuda Triangle.
The Triangle's been trying to pull it back ever since.
Duck and cover.
It's harmless.
The inventory kicks up a little static from time to time.
Why are you grinning?
Well, don't you think this stuff is kind of cool?
I mean...
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He'll be back.
- Hello?
- We should stick together.
Right this way, please.
Many of the items in here, kind of like the blood stone, Pete, that you wrestled with last night, the channel of tangential energy...
Well, tangential energy is kind of like the energy that forced the museum employee, last night, into... well, into almost committing murder.
- So how does that happen?
- We're not really exactly sure how.
It goes back to Einstein, and E equals...
Yeah, okay.
Somehow... the matter that is in here has just enough energy to move other matter.
You know, like you.
- Move me where?
- Into trouble.
Bunk.
Is gravity bunk?
Magnetism?
These are mysterious forces that we live with, but we can't explain 'em.
Can you even explain to me how a radio works?
And you don't care, as long as you get the traffic report.
But if a radio landed in the hands of Thomas Jefferson, you know what Jefferson would do?
He would just lock it up until he figured out it wasn't gonna kill him.
And that is exactly... what we do here.
We take the unexplained... and we just safely tuck it away in this super-sized Pandora's box.
- Metaphorically speaking.
- Pandora's box is over in aisle 989B.
Empty, of course.
Do the world a favor and clear your mind.
Well, that should be easy.
How did that get there?
'Cause I didn't pick that thing up.
It still amazes me how that thing moves.
What?
What is it?
Don't talk, don't hope, don't wish for anything.
- That kettle grants wishes?
- Yes.
Now Pete, look at me.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Open it.
Pete!
Pete, this...
This is a neutralizer.
You can think of this as a fire extinguisher for objects that act up.
Now look, I want you to come over here and drop that slowly, right in here.
There are items around here, if you were to put it in there, they would generate a flash, but this will be a little spark.
But you may flinch, and I don't want to, 'cause you could drop it, okay?
- Well, I have a wish.
- Don't!
- You wished for a ferret?
- No.
- That was already in the thing.
- I don't think so.
You wished for a transfer, didn't you?
Impossible wishes, wishes that can never be granted, they produce a ferret.
Don't ask me why.
My first year here, the whole place was crawling with ferrets.
- I swear, I didn't pick that thing up.
- No, I know, I know.
Not everybody is affected by everything.
Here, okay?
You have to be metaphysically predisposed.
And the external energies, they have to be in alignment.
- This is just a convergence thing.
- Right, sure, okay.
So we're...
we're all converged here, but I still have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
What you're supposed to do is hunt down whatever is threatening to ruin the world's day, neutralize it and bring it here.
You gotta snag it and bag it and tag it.
This is crazy!
This is crazy!
You know, I don't...
It could be, you know, crazy fun.
That's the attitude that brought you to our attention.
Do you guys want a cookie for the road?
What road?
There's rooms for you at Leena's Bed and Breakfast.
It's about 7 miles down the road that way, and I'll join you there in the morning and I'll tou...
I'll just join you there in the morning.
Stay close!
Seriously, Lattimer, there's been a serious screw-up.
I'm serious.
And now you have a ferret.
What?
This town...
Is this a town or what?
- What's the name of it?
- Well, it's more like a street.
So it says here to turn left at Buffalo Station.
What?
No, no, no.
It's "Buffalo Statue".
Well, your penmanship is atrocious.
I don't need wise...
You know, that's...
You know, don't do that.
Can you finish a sentence?
A full thought?
Would you really like me to?
Wait.
No, no, no.
Don't... don't call Dickinson.
- He hates being pestered.
- I don't pester.
When he knows something, he'll call.
Clearly the phrase "rolling with the punches"
is not in your vocabulary, so may I make a suggestion?
What might that be?
Unbunch your panties... and make the best of a bad situation.
And how do I do that?
Which part?
You're a freak.
Hello.
I'm Leena.
You must be Pete and Myka.
Come in.
I've got your rooms ready.
We serve three meals, 9:00, noon, and 5:00.
We've got radios in the rooms.
No tvs.
No in-room phones, but there is one there at the bottom of the stairs in the hallway.
You may choose any room.
Is there anywhere I can get a drink?
I mean, a drink... drink?
- What would you like?
- Whiskey neat.
- I can do that.
- Please do that.
She hates traveling.
She loves traveling.
It's the places she's traveled to that's the problem.
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm fine.
Just...
- Is everything okay?
- You're a lucky man, Pete.
I am?
You're in tune.
Very rare.
I don't know what that mea...
Look... are you... are you connected to Artie?
Let me know if your bed is big enough for you.
Hey, buddy.
- How'd it go today?
- Not bad.
Lattimer seems interested.
And Ms. Bering, not so much.
Did you select a case for them?
I don't mean any disrespect, but are we really sure they're the right people?
Because...
I'm fully aware of their baggage.
Now what's the real problem?
Artie, take yourself off the hook.
Their fate falls on me.
You say that...
Dickinson wants them back.
You've got to get them locked in.
Can't sleep?
Yeah.
Me neither.
We don't have to talk.
So...
- Do you always eat when stressed?
- Do you always talk this much?
You know, no light from the city to get in the way.
Nothing but sky.
This time of the year, we get Leo,
Cygnus, Sagittarius.
You know this how?
My dad and I used to camp a lot.
Where is he now?
Sorry.
What about your folks?
Colorado Springs.
They own a bookstore called Bering and Sons.
- How many brothers?
- No brothers.
Just me.
My dad thought the "and Sons" sounded classier.
He must be proud of you.
Mom is.
Well, did protecting the president of the United States turn him around?
This won't.
From Denver to DC to a warehouse security guard in six months.
Now there's a career trajectory.
Look, about Denver,
I didn't mean to spit on that last night.
What you did there was better than textbook.
We're not discussing that.
Ever.
All right, well, I'm gonna... go back upstairs... and not sleep some more.
Earlier, did you hear a...
Hear what?
Never mind.
Dickinson will call.
He better.
Rotation, time,
Seever City.
Come on.
So it's gonna be you, then.
Cody Thomas, a law school grad student, at the university of Southern Iowa.
- Iowa?
- Yeah, Iowa.
His parents were killed in a plane crash.
He is a really good kid, putting himself through college with the settlement.
Why are we going to Iowa?
To find whatever it is that pushed this kid over the edge.
- What edge?
- He struck his girlfriend.
That's it?
So far.
For the past five days, I have been reviewing 11 possible cases, looking for whatever doesn't fit, something out of place, like blood on a marble floor that leads to a man with a knife.
Because of a rock that isn't just a rock.
I've got a hunch that this is the one.
What exactly are we looking for?
Well, you tell me.
It's bigger than a breadbox...
Or smaller.
If there is an artifact at the heart of this, then I've prepared a few questions for Cody that might reveal it.
Actually, it's more than a few questions, but...
"Do you have the constant feeling that today is yesterday?"
If they say yes, then we could...
They probably won't say yes.
It's unlikely.
- We could be dealing with time slip.
- Or a hangover.
Please take this seriously.
I had a run-in with a Mayan calendar few years ago, that question saved my life.
And the two agents that were with me were not quite so lucky.
What happened to them?
Their clocks...
Stopped.
So, what?
They died?
They'll wish they had in 100 years or so.
Anyway...
Neutralizer.
The purple stuff.
If you find the artifact, just drown it in there, like this, if you can.
And if it's too big, you just take this and throw it, and then call me.
And don't ask me how it works, because I have no idea.
And it doesn't always work.
And don't ingest that stuff, because you'll... see things.
And we'll stay in contact with these.
I have one just like it.
- Two-way video communication?
- I call it a Farnsworth.
Named after Philo Farnsworth, who invented that in 1929, right after he invented the television.
Isn't that remarkable?
I mean, anyway, if you wanna talk to me, just press that button.
What is that?
Nicola Tesla,
Thomas Edison's chief rival or nemesis, depending, he cooked this up as an alternative to bullets.
It's a...
It's really... a kind of electric stun gun.
A polyphase ass-kicker.
Now, that's...
Just here.
Just don't put it past two to begin with.
That's the trigger, right there.
You should practice with it first.
One blast and down you go.
Don't point that at me.
Keep your finger away.
Just don't.
Give him the gun.
And also, it zaps short-term memory, which is why agent Morris doesn't remember seeing me at the museum.
And that's it.
That's what?
Go to Iowa.
Talk to Cody.
Find the artifact, if it exists.
Neutralize it and bring it back.
Don't get killed.
- How's her aura?
- Tortured.
Guilt and grief, mostly.
She has a soft spot for the ferret.
Just like you.
Now that was a long time ago.
You haven't changed that much.
She had a stowaway.
I found this in her room.
Oh, Lord, that's Houdini's wallet.
Fingers!
That was a bad spike.
That landed on something with her.
I requisitioned mesh screens for those shelves ten years ago.
And every year since.
- I've told you this.
- A few times.
You'd think Mrs. Frederic could maybe get that done.
Don't look at me.
Well, I had the FBI in here a while ago on a suspected terrorist thing.
All egos out to here and all looking like they're wearing daddy's suit.
Well, we feel the same way.
Let me know if the thing's going federal so I can prepare my staff for the media.
It's not going federal.
We just have a few questions and then we're gone.
It's Dickinson.
- Just a sec.
- Yeah, this is Bering.
- How you doing?
- We're in Iowa now, on assignment.
- Any luck in getting us back?
- The bad news is not so far.
The good news is, I've got a line on this Frederic woman.
She worked for the Treasury Department in the 1950s, and after...
Well, it's not the same woman.
The woman we met was younger.
I've got a Frederic in charge of some sort of secret sandbox.
Funded from a black ops budget I'm still trying to source.
I can fill you in.
These lines aren't secure.
Listen to me.
I'm doing everything I can to get you and Pete back here.
48 hours, tops.
So just follow your current orders and keep your head down.
Wait, sir!
Sir?
So how'd he sound?
48 hours.
- Yeah, but how'd he sound?
- Not good.
- What kind of questions?
- They're sort of diagnostic.
Diagnostic.
Like I'm sick?
You're Secret Service doctors?
Question number one.
"Have you recently encountered something that you feel has affected your life?"
Something like...
An object of some kind.
Do handcuffs count?
Question number two. "While looking up, do you have the sensation of falling?"
I don't feel like I'm falling.
- Next question.
- Okay, question number three.
"Have you recently smelled something that could best be described
- "as fudge when there is no fudge?"
- Fudge?
Is that...
Question four.
"Do you have ever feel like this might be a colossal waste of time?"
Okay, so...
We're done with those questions...
What do you think happened with your girlfriend?
- What's her name?
- I don't know.
Emily.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
I was in class, talking to the professor about some mock trial thing.
I woke up here, and they told me I beat Emily up.
- Have they let you see a doctor?
- Yeah.
- Says I'm fine.
- And no...
- No alcohol or drugs?
- No, I swear.
No history of blackouts?
This isn't me.
I would never hurt Emily.
This isn't me.
This isn't...
Se li uomini sapessino le cagioni della paura mia, capir potrebbero il mio dolor.
Get him out of here!
Let's get him down to secure lockup.
Well, that was scary.
Can you come this way, son?
Hello.
I'm Lorna Soliday.
I'm Cody's lawyer.
And did Travis call you?
Sheriff Travis respects the law, and he doesn't like being railroaded by federal agents.
Are you that hands-on with all your clients?
- Just my godson.
- So you knew his parents.
Very well.
And neither Cody nor I will be answering any more questions
- until I know what this is about.
- We're interested in Cody's behavior.
- His violent behavior.
- As in, where's it coming from?
What is this?
Someone pegged him as a threat to the President?
Not yet.
Not ever.
That's not Cody.
It was Cody that just destroyed that table.
Not to mention what he did to his girlfriend.
Does the secret service investigate every case
- of battery among college students?
- Nope.
Just this one.
- So where'd the Italian come in?
- What do you mean?
He spoke Italian in there, just before he decided
- that the interview was over.
- I don't know anything about that.
Well, has Cody come into contact with anything unusual, say, in the past few days?
- Yes.
You two.
- That was a serious question.
That was a serious answer.
Any more questions, Sheriff Travis has my number.
You felt that, right?
I'm not sure what you mean.
It got hot.
But you knew to get me to the floor before he freaked out.
The vibe.
Right.
Okay, so how do those things work?
Is there false alarms or...
- It happens all the time.
- So why do you trust them?
One time I didn't, and I should have.
You're right.
It's Italian, sort of.
I mean, this is either part gibberish.
I don't know.
It's some kind of code, maybe.
And my software can barely translate any of this and says "dolor"
means "pain."
And a text search came up with nothing.
There's no films, no books, no plays, no songs, no poems.
So what now?
You're right beside a college campus.
You can go find somebody who speaks Italian.
Excuse me.
Professor Marzotto?
We're with the secret service.
Oh, my.
It's an old construction.
15th century.
It's not working-class Italian either.
This is high brow.
- So what's he saying?
- Roughly?
"If people knew
"the reasons for my fear,
"they'd be able to understand my pain."
Do you visit Italy a lot?
I haven't been back in nearly two years.
But you're sure this translation is correct.
I'm a Renaissance scholar.
I'm sure.
One last question.
Do you know a student here named Cody Thomas?
I know of him.
I read about him in the paper.
It's a sad story.
- How so?
- Well, you know.
He was a good kid, from what I heard.
And he had some sort of a breakdown.
All right, well, if we need you to translate anything else...
I'd be more than happy to help.
You can reach me at that number.
Great.
Thank you.
He's hiding something.
Did you see his neck pulse?
Don't you have a scrupulous eye for detail.
- He shelves his books alphabetically.
- I didn't notice that.
And he puts pens in one cup, pencils in another.
Now you're scaring me.
Did you see where he put his pen right before we left?
Was Sherlock Holmes a big deal at your parents' bookstore?
- Something got Marzotto going.
- And you.
I don't like being lied to.
I'll remember that.
Do you want to go back and hit him again?
No, I want a hard phone line.
I thought this was a colossal waste of time.
Not anymore.
Hold up.
- Do you always walk so fast?
- Yes, I do.
Are you coming?
I have an incoming code Madrid for Minnie Harris.
Reply 6955.
- Hi, Minnie.
- Hey, hotshot.
- How's the White House?
- You know, it's a lot smaller than it looks on TV.
How are you?
- Chad and I are dating.
- Very nice.
Yes, it is.
- Look, I need some information.
- Okay, shoot.
Edward Marzotto, one "z" two "t"s.
- Professor at Southern Iowa University.
- Turnaround?
I need it now.
Sorry, I know this is big.
It's not a problem.
Hang on and I'll give you the highlights?
- For sure.
- Thanks.
Hang on.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Government agents are asking me lots of questions I can't answer without getting you and me into a lot of trouble.
It's about the book.
Your boyfriend is quoting from it.
How's Myka?
Edgy, irritable.
You know, Myka.
- Why?
- Just checking.
Listen, there's something I forgot to mention before.
- What?
- Just before Cody got physical, there was some kind of a...
I don't know, a heat wave.
It just rolled right off of him.
This happen after a question?
No, he was talking about his girlfriend, Emily Krueger.
- You talked to her, right?
- No, not yet.
All right.
Listen,
I'm gonna check out that heat thing, and see if that relates to anything.
And... meanwhile, what was that translation?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
Do you want me to...
Do you want me to run that again?
I got it.
You're positive that's the translation?
Absolutely positive?
Yeah, I mean, that's what Marzotto said.
- I'll call you back.
- Okay.
Got some good stuff.
Edward Melville Marzotto.
- Melville?
- Yeah, I know.
Anyway, the man loves his Italian art.
He just got back from Italy eight weeks ago, and the cops think...
Hey, bunny.
- Slow down.
- Walk faster.
So what'd you find out?
What happened in there?
Tell me.
I heard a...
I thought I heard... a voice over the phone that I really should not be hearing.
Same thing you heard at Leena's.
Look, sometimes we...
We hear things
- and see things that aren't there.
- What I heard can't be there.
- It can't be.
- Then it's not.
I mean, maybe it's post-traumatic stress.
I read the press release of what went down in Denver.
- Lives were saved.
- Lives were lost.
You're a hero.
You're gonna put me on a psych eval, aren't you?
Why would I do that?
Because you need to be able to depend on your partner.
All right, well, then you're just gonna have to depend on me to know that you're okay.
We're gonna finish this case, we're gonna get out of here.
We will.
I don't know if I can.
I don't even know what we're looking for.
Yes, you do.
I mean, whatever doesn't fit.
You know, something that's out of place.
Marzotto lied to us.
He said that the last time
- he was in Italy was...
- Two years ago.
Yeah, my contact told me it was eight weeks ago.
How'bout that?
I wonder what else he lied about.
- I guess we need more information.
- Yes, we do.
- Cody's girlfriend.
- Emily Krueger.
I need a picture!
Just give me a picture.
Give me a picture.
Don't make me come down there!
All right.
I know this is... awkward.
And I feel terrible, but...
You can't keep it.
I don't know what I was thinking even taking it out of Italy, but it has to go back.
I'm going to Rome next week.
And that's coming with me.
What's that for?
I hate this part.
- Emily, you're late.
- Sorry.
We were setting up for the party.
Can I help you?
Emily Krueger?
I know your pain, trust me.
We saw you leaving professor Marzotto's office, didn't we?
Oh, right.
I was there for a meeting.
For the play.
I'm in it.
Marzotto's sort of a technical advisor.
Does he know about your relationship with Cody?
He knows what happened.
Why?
Because when we talked to him about Cody, he didn't mention you.
Or that you'd just been to see him.
Maybe he was trying to protect my privacy.
- Why did you guys mention Cody?
- We needed something translated.
Yeah, have you ever heard Cody speak Italian?
Just once, when he did this.
- How long have you known Cody?
- Since the eighth grade.
Got serious after his parents died.
I came here for theater.
He applied for law school.
His godmother helped him get in.
- Lorna Soliday?
- You met her?
- Does she have any family?
- Just Cody.
And that's not even real family.
She made sure that he got that big settlement when his parents died.
Do you know what it means?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Only that he's afraid of abandonment.
It scares him.
Maybe he thought that I was spending too much time on the play.
I don't know.
Can I go back to work now?
Ten to one this has nothing to do with the hocus pocus Artie's pushing.
How'bout a billion to one?
How about a cute girl in a play by Machiavelli makes her insecure boyfriend freak out?
Or... or try this.
Emily, an actress, is a ruthless gold digger.
She'd know which buttons to push on her insecure boyfriend to get him made enough to hit her.
She goes for the money.
Sues him for it.
What kind of women do you date?
- It's Marzotto.
- What?
The attendant said he heard him speaking Italian before he doused himself.
Hold on.
Why'd you talk to marzotto?
Who told you that?
Secret service hits campus, and people notice.
And now he's dead.
Before this, you said something to make Cody want to knock your heads off.
- Something you want to tell me?
- We should talk later.
- Let me tell you something...
- Sure.
Something that makes it seem like I couldn't kick your ass in front of your men.
Boys, can we put our badges back in our pants, please?
Sheriff.
What was that?
- We gotta get to Marzotto's office.
- And how are we gonna get in?
Hotshot.
What the hell is Warehouse 13?
We haven't met.
I'm Mrs. Frederic.
- How'd you get in here?
- Through a door.
Warehouse 13, is it yours?
It's mine.
And so are Lattimer and Bering.
Excuse me?
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
Never mind.
The vibe thing?
My dad was a... fireman.
When I was 12,
I got this feeling one morning that I was never gonna see him again.
And you didn't say anything?
I didn't want him to see how scared I was.
He died that night in a house fire, saving a couple of kids.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
So now when you get a feeling...
- He got his pen out of his pencil cup.
- At least he died happy.
That's not funny.
You're right.
That's strange.
What?
The "m"s are out of order.
There's something in there.
- Is this it?
- I don't know.
- Well, what if it is?
- Then we're done.
- So open it.
- You open it.
I don't want another ferret or whatever.
- Se li uomini...
- Don't.
Just in case.
- What's that?
- Something's missing.
Let's call Artie.
Miss Soliday.
- What are you doing here?
- You heard what happened to Marzotto?
Yes, Sheriff Travis just called.
Now get out before I call him back and tell him you're searching this office without a warrant.
We're here investigating his suicide.
Ed didn't kill himself.
- He had help.
- What do you mean?
Somebody broke his heart.
We were together for three years.
And then we weren't.
I thought we were in love, but things change, and he chose someone else.
A student?
Did Emily Krueger break his heart?
And Cody's.
She's a despicable young woman who uses people to get what she wants, and then when she's done using them...
We're looking for something, something about this big.
We think Marzotto had it, but now it's missing.
Did Emily get it, you know, whatever it is?
Why don't you ask her?
She's helping with the party for the play.
Cody's there.
- Cody's out?
- Emily dropped the charges.
- Okay, we should go.
- I'm coming with you.
If you're confronting Emily, I need to be there for Cody.
Let's go.
I gotta lose weight.
Do you think Emily would ever hurt Cody?
Not physically.
Even if she tried, she couldn't.
And why not?
Me.
Cody has me.
I made a promise to his parents when I became his godmother that I would always be there to protect him.
It's only a matter of time before Cody realizes
Emily's just small-town trash.
Cody is destined for great things, and I'm helping him succeed.
With me, he can do anything or be anyone he wants.
Could you pull over for a sec?
I know you.
Well, that's a good sign.
Where am I?
Hospital.
In Iowa.
Seever City.
What happened?
Car accident.
You've been out for two days.
How's Pete?
Lattimer's still unconscious.
We don't know.
There's someone here to see you.
Someone who's gonna help you get back to where you belong.
The President?
Better.
Hey, bunny.
Hey.
You know you shouldn't be here, right?
I could say the same thing about you.
I think you just did.
I'm hurt.
That didn't stop you in Denver.
- I was late.
- No, bunny.
I was early.
I jumped the gun.
You're dead, Sam.
You need to get up now.
You got a lot of things you need to do.
Get up.
You have to get up now.
Get up.
Wake up, buddy.
Can you hear me?
Come on.
Here we go.
All right.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?
What?
What?
- You're giving me a wedgie.
- What?
Just... you okay?
Sit here and don't move.
I'm just gonna get the book.
If you find a badge, it's mine.
Never mind.
I found it.
You okay?
Soliday crashed the car.
You think?
Where is she?
She's not here.
She had... some kind of jewelry in her hair, like a comb thing.
It looked old, like it would fit in the book.
- Pete, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Just... here, answer that.
You're looking for jewelry.
This, this thing.
Yeah, we know.
We just saw it in a woman's hair.
- She tried to kill us.
- A woman?
What woman?
Her name is Lorna Soliday.
She's...
Part of the ruling class, single, successful, middle-aged.
She's a survivor of family tragedies and the death of loved ones.
She's connected somehow to a young man, that she believes needs her protection?
He's good, yeah.
What's the matter with you two?
Okay, anyway, look.
This comb is transmitting Lucretia Borgia.
- Lucretia who?
- Borgia.
She's a cutthroat Italian who ruled Italy in the 1600s with her father and brothers.
My family owned a book store, remember?
That's right.
So what do you mean the comb's transmitting?
An alchemist made it, okay?
Out of what, I don't know.
It's supposed to be some kind of Renaissance roofie.
Somehow the crystals in the ionized metal are affecting brain chemistry.
- What about the phrase?
- Yeah, the phrase.
That's like some kind of phonetic trigger.
This is a very, very, very unhappy woman.
Very unlucky in love.
- There's supposed to be a jewelry box.
- We found it in Marzotto's office.
He must have given Soliday the comb.
Like her, she wants love at any cost.
She wants love, and she is gonna kill to get it.
She wants...
She wants Cody, so she wants Emily gone.
And Emily's at the party.
What are you talking about a party?
What party?
God.
Some renaissance blowout for some Machiavelli play.
Machia...
This woman's gonna be there?
You've gotta stop this woman.
Lucretia Borgia, 600 years ago, started a bloody reign of terror, and this comb is gonna wanna start it all over again.
It's got twisted desires, and it'll amplify, it'll spread like some kind of orgiastic virus.
First to Iowa, then to Nebraska, then to Illinois.
We understand.
Probably first to Illinois and then...
Okay, look, we need to get you to a hospital first and...
No, look, I'm trained to take a bullet if necessary.
But...
I'm not sure how to stop a dead Italian cougar.
We need some kind of approach.
Well, I have no more color-coded plans.
There's a silver lining.
Okay, I'll go in, grab Cody.
- You flank.
- No, you flank.
Trust me.
That's not creepy.
How you doing?
That's nice.
Come on, man, you don't wanna do this.
Look.
You don't wanna hurt her.
Just let Emily go.
He intends to.
Her dying scream will be the trigger...
Look, nobody's screaming, okay?
We're gonna take a deep breath, and we're all gonna come back down to Earth.
Cute.
Kid's fast.
What's your pain, Lorna?
What are you afraid of?
You know.
And so does she.
Show's over.
Drop the comb... thing.
Did you really let your lover die?
- Shut up.
- For a chance at glory?
I said shut up.
Don't look at it, Myka.
Yeah, sorry.
No one's dying here tonight.
But you might lose a tooth.
Duck and cover?
- What did I do?
- It's okay.
It's over.
Love hurts, I know.
So here's the deal.
You got a choice.
You can come back to DC.
Or you can stay with the new assignment.
- What's the catch?
- I only get you.
Lattimer has to stay there.
- And if I stay, what happens to Pete?
- He still stays.
- How long do I have to think about it?
- About five more seconds.
Four, three, two.
Now, in addition to all the museums and art galleries and other great stuff here in our nation's capital, there's one thing you're gonna love probably more than anything else... the dinosaurs.
This way.
Stick together.
Agent Bering?
- Hi, Chet Greenfield.
- Hello.
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.
My assistant said you double-checked everything yesterday.
I did, but I'd like to run a full review before we lock it down.
Sure.
- With you.
- Me?
You're the boss.
I'd like to avoid any chain-of-command confusion.
I tell you, and it gets done.
- Shall we start in the main hall?
- Well, I understand,
- but I'm pretty booked upright now.
- I apologize for the inconvenience.
- I'll clear my schedule.
- I'd appreciate that, sir.
Good morning, Kacey.
I just figured out who you are.
You're a fireman.
No.
Come on.
You know absolutely everything about me.
Well, that's because you talk a lot.
Gordon, this is agent Bering with the Secret Service.
Gordon Letanik?
And what's...
What's this?
An Aztec blood stone.
The boss of virgin sacrifices.
Handsome devil.
I'm just cleaning him for the reception tonight.
Agent Bering wants the group D artifacts moved to the west wall.
They're blocking an exit.
Lose Tuvalu and Malta.
Move Britain to the back.
If it still doesn't fit, see me and we'll cut something else.
Yes, sir.
I'll just finish up.
What's next?
The main floor bathrooms.
I'll need the plumbing pulled again.
I would try to sneak you in, but the Secret Service will be there, and they can be jerks.
So I've heard.
Call you soon.
You promise?
Promise.
Bye now.
Champagne?
Thank you.
Champagne?
Cham...
Status check on Eagle.
- Who's on Emerald entrance?
- Me.
Morris.
Why aren't you at Emerald?
Well, because I'm here.
- How's Home Base?
- We're calling Home Base "Magenta".
Well, I'm not.
- You changed the protocol.
- I tweaked it.
I wrote it.
And I didn't use colors.
Why weren't you at my briefing?
I was vetting one of the servers.
- Screwing off is more like it.
- Well, you say po-tah-to.
- Get back to Emerald.
- You're not my superior.
Dickinson gave this to me.
I'm running it.
- Meeka.
- Myka.
I get... vibes.
Sorry?
This isn't some run and gun that you're used to in Denver.
- Get to the point, Lattimer.
- Dickinson gave you this shindig with my protocol because my specialty is logistics, framing... and I kid you not, there is something really off in here.
Eagle at Magenta.
Mr. President, wait a moment, please.
This is Bering.
Eagle is free to enter.
Negative, negative.
This is Lattimer.
Hold Eagle at five until further.
- Copy?
- Copy.
Holding Eagle.
Get back to Emerald.
Look, Myka, why don't you pull your head out of your Magenta and feel the room.
- Something's off.
- Listen, Showboat.
Nothing's off.
The room is fine.
Everything is fine.
Now take your vibe... and go.
- Enjoy your party.
- I will.
I want a perimeter check asap.
- Emerald clear.
- Peach clear.
- Orange clear.
- Gold clear.
Crimson clear.
There's...
There's blood, so...
Pete?
- What are you doing here?
- Working.
Is there a fire?
- Excuse me, sir.
Wait just a second.
- Secret Service.
This is...
Gotta go.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
That's an okay for Eagle to enter.
Affirmative.
Clear Eagle.
Freeze!
Drop the knife.
Hold your fire!
Seriously, Gordon, drop the knife.
Drop that.
- Whatever it is.
- Can't do that, Pete.
Weapon.
We're done here.
Tell me you found the guy.
The guy who you said stole the rock?
We're gonna need a sample.
Come on, Dickinson.
Well, you said, among many strange things,
- that the rock was bleeding.
- It was.
Taxpayers will probably wanna know if you were high, paranoid, or just part of an Aztec art theft ring.
In the meantime, you're suspended, with pay, for two weeks, till we get this thing worked out.
- What about Morris?
- He says nothing happened at emerald.
Okay, can we... stop with the colors already?
What about...
the guy with the knife?
- What, Letanik?
- Yes.
He's in a coma.
Docs don't know why or how long that's gonna last.
- And Bering?
- Myka's being thanked personally by the President and the first lady.
- Of course she is.
- She's going places.
You, on the other hand, you're going to the bathroom.
That's funny.
Mr. Lattimer.
My name's Frederic.
Frederic what?
- Mrs. Frederic.
- Well, that's a relief.
I'm with the government.
I'm here on a matter of national security.
- What's that?
- An invitation to endless wonder.
Could you sound a little more creepy?
Read it.
Please note the action code.
It is legitimate.
- You're part of my bailiwick now.
- Your bailiwick?
- You're working for me.
- For you?
- Am I stuttering?
- No, ma'am.
All right, I get it.
It's a... this is a joke, right?
Dickinson put you guys up...
This is Dickinson being funny, right?
Do I look like a joke?
You're to be in South Dakota at those coordinates at noon tomorrow.
You will mention our meeting and your pending assignment to no one.
Is that understood?
How long am I gonna be in South Dakota?
- Indefinitely.
- Indef... no, no.
I've got a life here.
Really?
I've got... things.
Pack light, Mr. Lattimer.
We'll ship what you need and store the rest.
Prepare to turn right in 100 feet.
Turn right now.
You have missed your turn.
Go back.
Turn right.
Destination straight ahead.
You gotta be kidding me.
Endless wonder.
It's agent Lattimer!
I'm here!
Great.
- I heard you were suspended.
- Yeah, I heard that too.
Why are you here?
I was ordered here, last night.
Mrs. Frederic.
Said it was a matter of...
National security.
Right.
How are you guys doing?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to fix the fish.
- Stop right there.
- What are you doing?
This is the guy.
The one from last night.
- The guy who stole the rock.
- You stole the rock.
It's a blood stone.
It's safe.
It's inside the building.
It's the property of the museum.
And that museum is property of the Government, so is the warehouse.
And so am I.
I'm secret service.
I also work for Mrs. Frederic.
I'm Dr. Nielson.
You can call me Artie.
Got some ID?
We take the secret part seriously around here.
I just wanted to thank you for your assist in last night's retrieval.
That was very good.
Did you throw that foot ball at me?
You weren't here when I threw it.
It takes a while to circle back.
Come on inside.
- I'll show you around.
- Around what?
What am I doing here?
I'll explain everything inside.
Come on.
I made cookies.
Come on.
Really, it's okay.
Go inside.
Don't go far!
Okay.
Come on in.
Wait for me at the bottom of the stairs.
It's fine.
Don't touch anything.
Don't touch the bombs.
Hold this.
Hold it.
Come on.
It's okay.
Right this way.
Ms. Bering, Mr. Lattimer, welcome to Warehouse 13.
- I'm thrilled you're on the team.
- What team?
What is this place?
Officially, K-39 triple-Z on the North American grid.
But...
I like to think of it as America's attic.
Projet-SG (1.00)
Pete, close the door.
Tell me exactly what I'm doing here.
Exactly?
That's a little dif...
Well, to put it plainly, you're both joining me as fellow gatherers and protectors of secrets.
Put it plainer.
This...
This warehouse...
Look, the Warehouse needs you.
It needs...
Pete, don't touch.
It needs your combined talents.
He's intuitive, and you're...
You've got a scrupulous eye for detail.
He's scattershot, and you're meticulous.
You look, he leaps.
There's been a mistake.
I'm too valuable to be wasted here.
No offense.
- Of course not.
- Can I use your phone, please?
Mine?
It's broken.
- I have to make a phone call, so...
- There's no signal here.
Yeah, you're...
You're...
Just pull...
Pull the door, and you'll be... now.
There you go.
I think she had other plans.
So did I.
You want juice or are you a milk person?
- You know what I'd really like?
- I do indeed, but falling off the wagon may not be the best option at this point.
- Milk it is.
- Yeah.
- That's Mrs. Frederic.
- Long time ago.
- She looks exactly the same.
- Odd, isn't it?
You don't want a cookie?
- So who are these guys?
- Former colleagues.
And where are they now?
This one and this one are dead.
This one, a mental institution in Germany.
And this last one... disappeared.
One day I'll find him.
Ted, these are two of my best agents.
How can you not know?
I'm looking at the order.
You processed it.
How can't you know?
Hold on.
- Dickinson.
- Sir, it's Myka Bering.
Sir, I have a little situation here.
I'm not sure...
Yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I'm looking at the transfer order.
The name on here is Frederic.
You're transferred to where?
- Where are you?
- I'm in South Dakota.
- Where?
- South Dakota.
- What are you doing in South Dakota?
- You don't know about this?
No.
Who is Frederic?
Sir?
Sir?
- Who's this Frederic?
- Sir!
Yes, yes.
She handed me orders last night to come here to a warehouse in South Dakota.
The order code was solid, and Lattimer's here too.
Look, I'm requesting an immediate stand down and transfer back to DC.
Myka.
Myka, I can't do that, okay?
This order trumps me.
Let me get on this, I'll get you back here asap.
- What should I do?
- Follow orders.
- Those orders, both of you.
- And how long will this take?
Sir?
Sir?
Are you still there?
That's a pile of crap.
- No kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.
You're actually standing in a big pile of cow manure.
- Oatmeal scotchie?
- No.
Thank you.
I don't eat sugar.
Good for you.
Listen...
Please don't think of this assignment, you know, as some sort of punishment.
- Can you hold this?
- What?
You know, yeah, your presence here is not really a reaction to what happened to you in Denver.
So...
I got a commendation for what happened in Denver.
Yes, you did.
It's time for the nickel tour.
Come on.
The order trumps Dickinson?
The first Warehouse 13 was built in '98.
- So we're stuck.
- Until he works out a transfer, yes.
1898.
We didn't have a handle on how to store stuff.
It burned down.
Some remodeling and excavations were necessary as the years went on to accommodate the arrival of more and more and more and more artifacts.
What's stored here, exactly?
This and that.
Bric-a-brac.
Some things along the lines of... last night's rock and roll.
I'm talking about the blood stone.
Both hands... on the bar, please.
I think I'll survive a crash.
No, that's not a safety bar.
It's a conduit.
You and Pete are the power source.
Your combined electrical energy makes this thing move.
It's fine, it's fine.
Look, Thomas Edison built this automobile for Henry Ford as a proof of concept, and it's perfectly safe.
Trust me.
Put your hands on the bar.
Put your hands on the bar.
Thank you.
We need both of you.
Hands on the bar, Myka.
Thank you.
Edison, he wanted Ford to let go of oil, but Ford, no, no, he stuck with it because it ruined his engines faster.
People had to keep buying them.
- What is that?
- What?
That is training flight 22.
We pulled that from the Bermuda Triangle.
The Triangle's been trying to pull it back ever since.
Duck and cover.
It's harmless.
The inventory kicks up a little static from time to time.
Why are you grinning?
Well, don't you think this stuff is kind of cool?
I mean...
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He'll be back.
- Hello?
- We should stick together.
Right this way, please.
Many of the items in here, kind of like the blood stone, Pete, that you wrestled with last night, the channel of tangential energy...
Well, tangential energy is kind of like the energy that forced the museum employee, last night, into... well, into almost committing murder.
- So how does that happen?
- We're not really exactly sure how.
It goes back to Einstein, and E equals...
Yeah, okay.
Somehow... the matter that is in here has just enough energy to move other matter.
You know, like you.
- Move me where?
- Into trouble.
Bunk.
Is gravity bunk?
Magnetism?
These are mysterious forces that we live with, but we can't explain 'em.
Can you even explain to me how a radio works?
And you don't care, as long as you get the traffic report.
But if a radio landed in the hands of Thomas Jefferson, you know what Jefferson would do?
He would just lock it up until he figured out it wasn't gonna kill him.
And that is exactly... what we do here.
We take the unexplained... and we just safely tuck it away in this super-sized Pandora's box.
- Metaphorically speaking.
- Pandora's box is over in aisle 989B.
Empty, of course.
Do the world a favor and clear your mind.
Well, that should be easy.
How did that get there?
'Cause I didn't pick that thing up.
It still amazes me how that thing moves.
What?
What is it?
Don't talk, don't hope, don't wish for anything.
- That kettle grants wishes?
- Yes.
Now Pete, look at me.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Open it.
Pete!
Pete, this...
This is a neutralizer.
You can think of this as a fire extinguisher for objects that act up.
Now look, I want you to come over here and drop that slowly, right in here.
There are items around here, if you were to put it in there, they would generate a flash, but this will be a little spark.
But you may flinch, and I don't want to, 'cause you could drop it, okay?
- Well, I have a wish.
- Don't!
- You wished for a ferret?
- No.
- That was already in the thing.
- I don't think so.
You wished for a transfer, didn't you?
Impossible wishes, wishes that can never be granted, they produce a ferret.
Don't ask me why.
My first year here, the whole place was crawling with ferrets.
- I swear, I didn't pick that thing up.
- No, I know, I know.
Not everybody is affected by everything.
Here, okay?
You have to be metaphysically predisposed.
And the external energies, they have to be in alignment.
- This is just a convergence thing.
- Right, sure, okay.
So we're...
we're all converged here, but I still have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
What you're supposed to do is hunt down whatever is threatening to ruin the world's day, neutralize it and bring it here.
You gotta snag it and bag it and tag it.
This is crazy!
This is crazy!
You know, I don't...
It could be, you know, crazy fun.
That's the attitude that brought you to our attention.
Do you guys want a cookie for the road?
What road?
There's rooms for you at Leena's Bed and Breakfast.
It's about 7 miles down the road that way, and I'll join you there in the morning and I'll tou...
I'll just join you there in the morning.
Stay close!
Seriously, Lattimer, there's been a serious screw-up.
I'm serious.
And now you have a ferret.
What?
This town...
Is this a town or what?
- What's the name of it?
- Well, it's more like a street.
So it says here to turn left at Buffalo Station.
What?
No, no, no.
It's "Buffalo Statue".
Well, your penmanship is atrocious.
I don't need wise...
You know, that's...
You know, don't do that.
Can you finish a sentence?
A full thought?
Would you really like me to?
Wait.
No, no, no.
Don't... don't call Dickinson.
- He hates being pestered.
- I don't pester.
When he knows something, he'll call.
Clearly the phrase "rolling with the punches"
is not in your vocabulary, so may I make a suggestion?
What might that be?
Unbunch your panties... and make the best of a bad situation.
And how do I do that?
Which part?
You're a freak.
Hello.
I'm Leena.
You must be Pete and Myka.
Come in.
I've got your rooms ready.
We serve three meals, 9:00, noon, and 5:00.
We've got radios in the rooms.
No tvs.
No in-room phones, but there is one there at the bottom of the stairs in the hallway.
You may choose any room.
Is there anywhere I can get a drink?
I mean, a drink... drink?
- What would you like?
- Whiskey neat.
- I can do that.
- Please do that.
She hates traveling.
She loves traveling.
It's the places she's traveled to that's the problem.
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm fine.
Just...
- Is everything okay?
- You're a lucky man, Pete.
I am?
You're in tune.
Very rare.
I don't know what that mea...
Look... are you... are you connected to Artie?
Let me know if your bed is big enough for you.
Hey, buddy.
- How'd it go today?
- Not bad.
Lattimer seems interested.
And Ms. Bering, not so much.
Did you select a case for them?
I don't mean any disrespect, but are we really sure they're the right people?
Because...
I'm fully aware of their baggage.
Now what's the real problem?
Artie, take yourself off the hook.
Their fate falls on me.
You say that...
Dickinson wants them back.
You've got to get them locked in.
Can't sleep?
Yeah.
Me neither.
We don't have to talk.
So...
- Do you always eat when stressed?
- Do you always talk this much?
You know, no light from the city to get in the way.
Nothing but sky.
This time of the year, we get Leo,
Cygnus, Sagittarius.
You know this how?
My dad and I used to camp a lot.
Where is he now?
Sorry.
What about your folks?
Colorado Springs.
They own a bookstore called Bering and Sons.
- How many brothers?
- No brothers.
Just me.
My dad thought the "and Sons" sounded classier.
He must be proud of you.
Mom is.
Well, did protecting the president of the United States turn him around?
This won't.
From Denver to DC to a warehouse security guard in six months.
Now there's a career trajectory.
Look, about Denver,
I didn't mean to spit on that last night.
What you did there was better than textbook.
We're not discussing that.
Ever.
All right, well, I'm gonna... go back upstairs... and not sleep some more.
Earlier, did you hear a...
Hear what?
Never mind.
Dickinson will call.
He better.
Rotation, time,
Seever City.
Come on.
So it's gonna be you, then.
Cody Thomas, a law school grad student, at the university of Southern Iowa.
- Iowa?
- Yeah, Iowa.
His parents were killed in a plane crash.
He is a really good kid, putting himself through college with the settlement.
Why are we going to Iowa?
To find whatever it is that pushed this kid over the edge.
- What edge?
- He struck his girlfriend.
That's it?
So far.
For the past five days, I have been reviewing 11 possible cases, looking for whatever doesn't fit, something out of place, like blood on a marble floor that leads to a man with a knife.
Because of a rock that isn't just a rock.
I've got a hunch that this is the one.
What exactly are we looking for?
Well, you tell me.
It's bigger than a breadbox...
Or smaller.
If there is an artifact at the heart of this, then I've prepared a few questions for Cody that might reveal it.
Actually, it's more than a few questions, but...
"Do you have the constant feeling that today is yesterday?"
If they say yes, then we could...
They probably won't say yes.
It's unlikely.
- We could be dealing with time slip.
- Or a hangover.
Please take this seriously.
I had a run-in with a Mayan calendar few years ago, that question saved my life.
And the two agents that were with me were not quite so lucky.
What happened to them?
Their clocks...
Stopped.
So, what?
They died?
They'll wish they had in 100 years or so.
Anyway...
Neutralizer.
The purple stuff.
If you find the artifact, just drown it in there, like this, if you can.
And if it's too big, you just take this and throw it, and then call me.
And don't ask me how it works, because I have no idea.
And it doesn't always work.
And don't ingest that stuff, because you'll... see things.
And we'll stay in contact with these.
I have one just like it.
- Two-way video communication?
- I call it a Farnsworth.
Named after Philo Farnsworth, who invented that in 1929, right after he invented the television.
Isn't that remarkable?
I mean, anyway, if you wanna talk to me, just press that button.
What is that?
Nicola Tesla,
Thomas Edison's chief rival or nemesis, depending, he cooked this up as an alternative to bullets.
It's a...
It's really... a kind of electric stun gun.
A polyphase ass-kicker.
Now, that's...
Just here.
Just don't put it past two to begin with.
That's the trigger, right there.
You should practice with it first.
One blast and down you go.
Don't point that at me.
Keep your finger away.
Just don't.
Give him the gun.
And also, it zaps short-term memory, which is why agent Morris doesn't remember seeing me at the museum.
And that's it.
That's what?
Go to Iowa.
Talk to Cody.
Find the artifact, if it exists.
Neutralize it and bring it back.
Don't get killed.
- How's her aura?
- Tortured.
Guilt and grief, mostly.
She has a soft spot for the ferret.
Just like you.
Now that was a long time ago.
You haven't changed that much.
She had a stowaway.
I found this in her room.
Oh, Lord, that's Houdini's wallet.
Fingers!
That was a bad spike.
That landed on something with her.
I requisitioned mesh screens for those shelves ten years ago.
And every year since.
- I've told you this.
- A few times.
You'd think Mrs. Frederic could maybe get that done.
Don't look at me.
Well, I had the FBI in here a while ago on a suspected terrorist thing.
All egos out to here and all looking like they're wearing daddy's suit.
Well, we feel the same way.
Let me know if the thing's going federal so I can prepare my staff for the media.
It's not going federal.
We just have a few questions and then we're gone.
It's Dickinson.
- Just a sec.
- Yeah, this is Bering.
- How you doing?
- We're in Iowa now, on assignment.
- Any luck in getting us back?
- The bad news is not so far.
The good news is, I've got a line on this Frederic woman.
She worked for the Treasury Department in the 1950s, and after...
Well, it's not the same woman.
The woman we met was younger.
I've got a Frederic in charge of some sort of secret sandbox.
Funded from a black ops budget I'm still trying to source.
I can fill you in.
These lines aren't secure.
Listen to me.
I'm doing everything I can to get you and Pete back here.
48 hours, tops.
So just follow your current orders and keep your head down.
Wait, sir!
Sir?
So how'd he sound?
48 hours.
- Yeah, but how'd he sound?
- Not good.
- What kind of questions?
- They're sort of diagnostic.
Diagnostic.
Like I'm sick?
You're Secret Service doctors?
Question number one.
"Have you recently encountered something that you feel has affected your life?"
Something like...
An object of some kind.
Do handcuffs count?
Question number two. "While looking up, do you have the sensation of falling?"
I don't feel like I'm falling.
- Next question.
- Okay, question number three.
"Have you recently smelled something that could best be described
- "as fudge when there is no fudge?"
- Fudge?
Is that...
Question four.
"Do you have ever feel like this might be a colossal waste of time?"
Okay, so...
We're done with those questions...
What do you think happened with your girlfriend?
- What's her name?
- I don't know.
Emily.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
I was in class, talking to the professor about some mock trial thing.
I woke up here, and they told me I beat Emily up.
- Have they let you see a doctor?
- Yeah.
- Says I'm fine.
- And no...
- No alcohol or drugs?
- No, I swear.
No history of blackouts?
This isn't me.
I would never hurt Emily.
This isn't me.
This isn't...
Se li uomini sapessino le cagioni della paura mia, capir potrebbero il mio dolor.
Get him out of here!
Let's get him down to secure lockup.
Well, that was scary.
Can you come this way, son?
Hello.
I'm Lorna Soliday.
I'm Cody's lawyer.
And did Travis call you?
Sheriff Travis respects the law, and he doesn't like being railroaded by federal agents.
Are you that hands-on with all your clients?
- Just my godson.
- So you knew his parents.
Very well.
And neither Cody nor I will be answering any more questions
- until I know what this is about.
- We're interested in Cody's behavior.
- His violent behavior.
- As in, where's it coming from?
What is this?
Someone pegged him as a threat to the President?
Not yet.
Not ever.
That's not Cody.
It was Cody that just destroyed that table.
Not to mention what he did to his girlfriend.
Does the secret service investigate every case
- of battery among college students?
- Nope.
Just this one.
- So where'd the Italian come in?
- What do you mean?
He spoke Italian in there, just before he decided
- that the interview was over.
- I don't know anything about that.
Well, has Cody come into contact with anything unusual, say, in the past few days?
- Yes.
You two.
- That was a serious question.
That was a serious answer.
Any more questions, Sheriff Travis has my number.
You felt that, right?
I'm not sure what you mean.
It got hot.
But you knew to get me to the floor before he freaked out.
The vibe.
Right.
Okay, so how do those things work?
Is there false alarms or...
- It happens all the time.
- So why do you trust them?
One time I didn't, and I should have.
You're right.
It's Italian, sort of.
I mean, this is either part gibberish.
I don't know.
It's some kind of code, maybe.
And my software can barely translate any of this and says "dolor"
means "pain."
And a text search came up with nothing.
There's no films, no books, no plays, no songs, no poems.
So what now?
You're right beside a college campus.
You can go find somebody who speaks Italian.
Excuse me.
Professor Marzotto?
We're with the secret service.
Oh, my.
It's an old construction.
15th century.
It's not working-class Italian either.
This is high brow.
- So what's he saying?
- Roughly?
"If people knew
"the reasons for my fear,
"they'd be able to understand my pain."
Do you visit Italy a lot?
I haven't been back in nearly two years.
But you're sure this translation is correct.
I'm a Renaissance scholar.
I'm sure.
One last question.
Do you know a student here named Cody Thomas?
I know of him.
I read about him in the paper.
It's a sad story.
- How so?
- Well, you know.
He was a good kid, from what I heard.
And he had some sort of a breakdown.
All right, well, if we need you to translate anything else...
I'd be more than happy to help.
You can reach me at that number.
Great.
Thank you.
He's hiding something.
Did you see his neck pulse?
Don't you have a scrupulous eye for detail.
- He shelves his books alphabetically.
- I didn't notice that.
And he puts pens in one cup, pencils in another.
Now you're scaring me.
Did you see where he put his pen right before we left?
Was Sherlock Holmes a big deal at your parents' bookstore?
- Something got Marzotto going.
- And you.
I don't like being lied to.
I'll remember that.
Do you want to go back and hit him again?
No, I want a hard phone line.
I thought this was a colossal waste of time.
Not anymore.
Hold up.
- Do you always walk so fast?
- Yes, I do.
Are you coming?
I have an incoming code Madrid for Minnie Harris.
Reply 6955.
- Hi, Minnie.
- Hey, hotshot.
- How's the White House?
- You know, it's a lot smaller than it looks on TV.
How are you?
- Chad and I are dating.
- Very nice.
Yes, it is.
- Look, I need some information.
- Okay, shoot.
Edward Marzotto, one "z" two "t"s.
- Professor at Southern Iowa University.
- Turnaround?
I need it now.
Sorry, I know this is big.
It's not a problem.
Hang on and I'll give you the highlights?
- For sure.
- Thanks.
Hang on.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Government agents are asking me lots of questions I can't answer without getting you and me into a lot of trouble.
It's about the book.
Your boyfriend is quoting from it.
How's Myka?
Edgy, irritable.
You know, Myka.
- Why?
- Just checking.
Listen, there's something I forgot to mention before.
- What?
- Just before Cody got physical, there was some kind of a...
I don't know, a heat wave.
It just rolled right off of him.
This happen after a question?
No, he was talking about his girlfriend, Emily Krueger.
- You talked to her, right?
- No, not yet.
All right.
Listen,
I'm gonna check out that heat thing, and see if that relates to anything.
And... meanwhile, what was that translation?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
Do you want me to...
Do you want me to run that again?
I got it.
You're positive that's the translation?
Absolutely positive?
Yeah, I mean, that's what Marzotto said.
- I'll call you back.
- Okay.
Got some good stuff.
Edward Melville Marzotto.
- Melville?
- Yeah, I know.
Anyway, the man loves his Italian art.
He just got back from Italy eight weeks ago, and the cops think...
Hey, bunny.
- Slow down.
- Walk faster.
So what'd you find out?
What happened in there?
Tell me.
I heard a...
I thought I heard... a voice over the phone that I really should not be hearing.
Same thing you heard at Leena's.
Look, sometimes we...
We hear things
- and see things that aren't there.
- What I heard can't be there.
- It can't be.
- Then it's not.
I mean, maybe it's post-traumatic stress.
I read the press release of what went down in Denver.
- Lives were saved.
- Lives were lost.
You're a hero.
You're gonna put me on a psych eval, aren't you?
Why would I do that?
Because you need to be able to depend on your partner.
All right, well, then you're just gonna have to depend on me to know that you're okay.
We're gonna finish this case, we're gonna get out of here.
We will.
I don't know if I can.
I don't even know what we're looking for.
Yes, you do.
I mean, whatever doesn't fit.
You know, something that's out of place.
Marzotto lied to us.
He said that the last time
- he was in Italy was...
- Two years ago.
Yeah, my contact told me it was eight weeks ago.
How'bout that?
I wonder what else he lied about.
- I guess we need more information.
- Yes, we do.
- Cody's girlfriend.
- Emily Krueger.
I need a picture!
Just give me a picture.
Give me a picture.
Don't make me come down there!
All right.
I know this is... awkward.
And I feel terrible, but...
You can't keep it.
I don't know what I was thinking even taking it out of Italy, but it has to go back.
I'm going to Rome next week.
And that's coming with me.
What's that for?
I hate this part.
- Emily, you're late.
- Sorry.
We were setting up for the party.
Can I help you?
Emily Krueger?
I know your pain, trust me.
We saw you leaving professor Marzotto's office, didn't we?
Oh, right.
I was there for a meeting.
For the play.
I'm in it.
Marzotto's sort of a technical advisor.
Does he know about your relationship with Cody?
He knows what happened.
Why?
Because when we talked to him about Cody, he didn't mention you.
Or that you'd just been to see him.
Maybe he was trying to protect my privacy.
- Why did you guys mention Cody?
- We needed something translated.
Yeah, have you ever heard Cody speak Italian?
Just once, when he did this.
- How long have you known Cody?
- Since the eighth grade.
Got serious after his parents died.
I came here for theater.
He applied for law school.
His godmother helped him get in.
- Lorna Soliday?
- You met her?
- Does she have any family?
- Just Cody.
And that's not even real family.
She made sure that he got that big settlement when his parents died.
Do you know what it means?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Only that he's afraid of abandonment.
It scares him.
Maybe he thought that I was spending too much time on the play.
I don't know.
Can I go back to work now?
Ten to one this has nothing to do with the hocus pocus Artie's pushing.
How'bout a billion to one?
How about a cute girl in a play by Machiavelli makes her insecure boyfriend freak out?
Or... or try this.
Emily, an actress, is a ruthless gold digger.
She'd know which buttons to push on her insecure boyfriend to get him made enough to hit her.
She goes for the money.
Sues him for it.
What kind of women do you date?
- It's Marzotto.
- What?
The attendant said he heard him speaking Italian before he doused himself.
Hold on.
Why'd you talk to marzotto?
Who told you that?
Secret service hits campus, and people notice.
And now he's dead.
Before this, you said something to make Cody want to knock your heads off.
- Something you want to tell me?
- We should talk later.
- Let me tell you something...
- Sure.
Something that makes it seem like I couldn't kick your ass in front of your men.
Boys, can we put our badges back in our pants, please?
Sheriff.
What was that?
- We gotta get to Marzotto's office.
- And how are we gonna get in?
Hotshot.
What the hell is Warehouse 13?
We haven't met.
I'm Mrs. Frederic.
- How'd you get in here?
- Through a door.
Warehouse 13, is it yours?
It's mine.
And so are Lattimer and Bering.
Excuse me?
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
Never mind.
The vibe thing?
My dad was a... fireman.
When I was 12,
I got this feeling one morning that I was never gonna see him again.
And you didn't say anything?
I didn't want him to see how scared I was.
He died that night in a house fire, saving a couple of kids.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
So now when you get a feeling...
- He got his pen out of his pencil cup.
- At least he died happy.
That's not funny.
You're right.
That's strange.
What?
The "m"s are out of order.
There's something in there.
- Is this it?
- I don't know.
- Well, what if it is?
- Then we're done.
- So open it.
- You open it.
I don't want another ferret or whatever.
- Se li uomini...
- Don't.
Just in case.
- What's that?
- Something's missing.
Let's call Artie.
Miss Soliday.
- What are you doing here?
- You heard what happened to Marzotto?
Yes, Sheriff Travis just called.
Now get out before I call him back and tell him you're searching this office without a warrant.
We're here investigating his suicide.
Ed didn't kill himself.
- He had help.
- What do you mean?
Somebody broke his heart.
We were together for three years.
And then we weren't.
I thought we were in love, but things change, and he chose someone else.
A student?
Did Emily Krueger break his heart?
And Cody's.
She's a despicable young woman who uses people to get what she wants, and then when she's done using them...
We're looking for something, something about this big.
We think Marzotto had it, but now it's missing.
Did Emily get it, you know, whatever it is?
Why don't you ask her?
She's helping with the party for the play.
Cody's there.
- Cody's out?
- Emily dropped the charges.
- Okay, we should go.
- I'm coming with you.
If you're confronting Emily, I need to be there for Cody.
Let's go.
I gotta lose weight.
Do you think Emily would ever hurt Cody?
Not physically.
Even if she tried, she couldn't.
And why not?
Me.
Cody has me.
I made a promise to his parents when I became his godmother that I would always be there to protect him.
It's only a matter of time before Cody realizes
Emily's just small-town trash.
Cody is destined for great things, and I'm helping him succeed.
With me, he can do anything or be anyone he wants.
Could you pull over for a sec?
I know you.
Well, that's a good sign.
Where am I?
Hospital.
In Iowa.
Seever City.
What happened?
Car accident.
You've been out for two days.
How's Pete?
Lattimer's still unconscious.
We don't know.
There's someone here to see you.
Someone who's gonna help you get back to where you belong.
The President?
Better.
Hey, bunny.
Hey.
You know you shouldn't be here, right?
I could say the same thing about you.
I think you just did.
I'm hurt.
That didn't stop you in Denver.
- I was late.
- No, bunny.
I was early.
I jumped the gun.
You're dead, Sam.
You need to get up now.
You got a lot of things you need to do.
Get up.
You have to get up now.
Get up.
Wake up, buddy.
Can you hear me?
Come on.
Here we go.
All right.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?
What?
What?
- You're giving me a wedgie.
- What?
Just... you okay?
Sit here and don't move.
I'm just gonna get the book.
If you find a badge, it's mine.
Never mind.
I found it.
You okay?
Soliday crashed the car.
You think?
Where is she?
She's not here.
She had... some kind of jewelry in her hair, like a comb thing.
It looked old, like it would fit in the book.
- Pete, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Just... here, answer that.
You're looking for jewelry.
This, this thing.
Yeah, we know.
We just saw it in a woman's hair.
- She tried to kill us.
- A woman?
What woman?
Her name is Lorna Soliday.
She's...
Part of the ruling class, single, successful, middle-aged.
She's a survivor of family tragedies and the death of loved ones.
She's connected somehow to a young man, that she believes needs her protection?
He's good, yeah.
What's the matter with you two?
Okay, anyway, look.
This comb is transmitting Lucretia Borgia.
- Lucretia who?
- Borgia.
She's a cutthroat Italian who ruled Italy in the 1600s with her father and brothers.
My family owned a book store, remember?
That's right.
So what do you mean the comb's transmitting?
An alchemist made it, okay?
Out of what, I don't know.
It's supposed to be some kind of Renaissance roofie.
Somehow the crystals in the ionized metal are affecting brain chemistry.
- What about the phrase?
- Yeah, the phrase.
That's like some kind of phonetic trigger.
This is a very, very, very unhappy woman.
Very unlucky in love.
- There's supposed to be a jewelry box.
- We found it in Marzotto's office.
He must have given Soliday the comb.
Like her, she wants love at any cost.
She wants love, and she is gonna kill to get it.
She wants...
She wants Cody, so she wants Emily gone.
And Emily's at the party.
What are you talking about a party?
What party?
God.
Some renaissance blowout for some Machiavelli play.
Machia...
This woman's gonna be there?
You've gotta stop this woman.
Lucretia Borgia, 600 years ago, started a bloody reign of terror, and this comb is gonna wanna start it all over again.
It's got twisted desires, and it'll amplify, it'll spread like some kind of orgiastic virus.
First to Iowa, then to Nebraska, then to Illinois.
We understand.
Probably first to Illinois and then...
Okay, look, we need to get you to a hospital first and...
No, look, I'm trained to take a bullet if necessary.
But...
I'm not sure how to stop a dead Italian cougar.
We need some kind of approach.
Well, I have no more color-coded plans.
There's a silver lining.
Okay, I'll go in, grab Cody.
- You flank.
- No, you flank.
Trust me.
That's not creepy.
How you doing?
That's nice.
Come on, man, you don't wanna do this.
Look.
You don't wanna hurt her.
Just let Emily go.
He intends to.
Her dying scream will be the trigger...
Look, nobody's screaming, okay?
We're gonna take a deep breath, and we're all gonna come back down to Earth.
Cute.
Kid's fast.
What's your pain, Lorna?
What are you afraid of?
You know.
And so does she.
Show's over.
Drop the comb... thing.
Did you really let your lover die?
- Shut up.
- For a chance at glory?
I said shut up.
Don't look at it, Myka.
Yeah, sorry.
No one's dying here tonight.
But you might lose a tooth.
Duck and cover?
- What did I do?
- It's okay.
It's over.
Love hurts, I know.
So here's the deal.
You got a choice.
You can come back to DC.
Or you can stay with the new assignment.
- What's the catch?
- I only get you.
Lattimer has to stay there.
- And if I stay, what happens to Pete?
- He still stays.
- How long do I have to think about it?
- About five more seconds.
Four, three, two.
Now, in addition to all the museums and art galleries and other great stuff here in our nation's capital, there's one thing you're gonna love probably more than anything else... the dinosaurs.
This way.
Stick together.
Agent Bering?
- Hi, Chet Greenfield.
- Hello.
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.
My assistant said you double-checked everything yesterday.
I did, but I'd like to run a full review before we lock it down.
Sure.
- With you.
- Me?
You're the boss.
I'd like to avoid any chain-of-command confusion.
I tell you, and it gets done.
- Shall we start in the main hall?
- Well, I understand,
- but I'm pretty booked upright now.
- I apologize for the inconvenience.
- I'll clear my schedule.
- I'd appreciate that, sir.
Good morning, Kacey.
I just figured out who you are.
You're a fireman.
No.
Come on.
You know absolutely everything about me.
Well, that's because you talk a lot.
Gordon, this is agent Bering with the Secret Service.
Gordon Letanik?
And what's...
What's this?
An Aztec blood stone.
The boss of virgin sacrifices.
Handsome devil.
I'm just cleaning him for the reception tonight.
Agent Bering wants the group D artifacts moved to the west wall.
They're blocking an exit.
Lose Tuvalu and Malta.
Move Britain to the back.
If it still doesn't fit, see me and we'll cut something else.
Yes, sir.
I'll just finish up.
What's next?
The main floor bathrooms.
I'll need the plumbing pulled again.
I would try to sneak you in, but the Secret Service will be there, and they can be jerks.
So I've heard.
Call you soon.
You promise?
Promise.
Bye now.
Champagne?
Thank you.
Champagne?
Cham...
Status check on Eagle.
- Who's on Emerald entrance?
- Me.
Morris.
Why aren't you at Emerald?
Well, because I'm here.
- How's Home Base?
- We're calling Home Base "Magenta".
Well, I'm not.
- You changed the protocol.
- I tweaked it.
I wrote it.
And I didn't use colors.
Why weren't you at my briefing?
I was vetting one of the servers.
- Screwing off is more like it.
- Well, you say po-tah-to.
- Get back to Emerald.
- You're not my superior.
Dickinson gave this to me.
I'm running it.
- Meeka.
- Myka.
I get... vibes.
Sorry?
This isn't some run and gun that you're used to in Denver.
- Get to the point, Lattimer.
- Dickinson gave you this shindig with my protocol because my specialty is logistics, framing... and I kid you not, there is something really off in here.
Eagle at Magenta.
Mr. President, wait a moment, please.
This is Bering.
Eagle is free to enter.
Negative, negative.
This is Lattimer.
Hold Eagle at five until further.
- Copy?
- Copy.
Holding Eagle.
Get back to Emerald.
Look, Myka, why don't you pull your head out of your Magenta and feel the room.
- Something's off.
- Listen, Showboat.
Nothing's off.
The room is fine.
Everything is fine.
Now take your vibe... and go.
- Enjoy your party.
- I will.
I want a perimeter check asap.
- Emerald clear.
- Peach clear.
- Orange clear.
- Gold clear.
Crimson clear.
There's...
There's blood, so...
Pete?
- What are you doing here?
- Working.
Is there a fire?
- Excuse me, sir.
Wait just a second.
- Secret Service.
This is...
Gotta go.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
That's an okay for Eagle to enter.
Affirmative.
Clear Eagle.
Freeze!
Drop the knife.
Hold your fire!
Seriously, Gordon, drop the knife.
Drop that.
- Whatever it is.
- Can't do that, Pete.
Weapon.
We're done here.
Tell me you found the guy.
The guy who you said stole the rock?
We're gonna need a sample.
Come on, Dickinson.
Well, you said, among many strange things,
- that the rock was bleeding.
- It was.
Taxpayers will probably wanna know if you were high, paranoid, or just part of an Aztec art theft ring.
In the meantime, you're suspended, with pay, for two weeks, till we get this thing worked out.
- What about Morris?
- He says nothing happened at emerald.
Okay, can we... stop with the colors already?
What about...
the guy with the knife?
- What, Letanik?
- Yes.
He's in a coma.
Docs don't know why or how long that's gonna last.
- And Bering?
- Myka's being thanked personally by the President and the first lady.
- Of course she is.
- She's going places.
You, on the other hand, you're going to the bathroom.
That's funny.
Mr. Lattimer.
My name's Frederic.
Frederic what?
- Mrs. Frederic.
- Well, that's a relief.
I'm with the government.
I'm here on a matter of national security.
- What's that?
- An invitation to endless wonder.
Could you sound a little more creepy?
Read it.
Please note the action code.
It is legitimate.
- You're part of my bailiwick now.
- Your bailiwick?
- You're working for me.
- For you?
- Am I stuttering?
- No, ma'am.
All right, I get it.
It's a... this is a joke, right?
Dickinson put you guys up...
This is Dickinson being funny, right?
Do I look like a joke?
You're to be in South Dakota at those coordinates at noon tomorrow.
You will mention our meeting and your pending assignment to no one.
Is that understood?
How long am I gonna be in South Dakota?
- Indefinitely.
- Indef... no, no.
I've got a life here.
Really?
I've got... things.
Pack light, Mr. Lattimer.
We'll ship what you need and store the rest.
Prepare to turn right in 100 feet.
Turn right now.
You have missed your turn.
Go back.
Turn right.
Destination straight ahead.
You gotta be kidding me.
Endless wonder.
It's agent Lattimer!
I'm here!
Great.
- I heard you were suspended.
- Yeah, I heard that too.
Why are you here?
I was ordered here, last night.
Mrs. Frederic.
Said it was a matter of...
National security.
Right.
How are you guys doing?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to fix the fish.
- Stop right there.
- What are you doing?
This is the guy.
The one from last night.
- The guy who stole the rock.
- You stole the rock.
It's a blood stone.
It's safe.
It's inside the building.
It's the property of the museum.
And that museum is property of the Government, so is the warehouse.
And so am I.
I'm secret service.
I also work for Mrs. Frederic.
I'm Dr. Nielson.
You can call me Artie.
Got some ID?
We take the secret part seriously around here.
I just wanted to thank you for your assist in last night's retrieval.
That was very good.
Did you throw that foot ball at me?
You weren't here when I threw it.
It takes a while to circle back.
Come on inside.
- I'll show you around.
- Around what?
What am I doing here?
I'll explain everything inside.
Come on.
I made cookies.
Come on.
Really, it's okay.
Go inside.
Don't go far!
Okay.
Come on in.
Wait for me at the bottom of the stairs.
It's fine.
Don't touch anything.
Don't touch the bombs.
Hold this.
Hold it.
Come on.
It's okay.
Right this way.
Ms. Bering, Mr. Lattimer, welcome to Warehouse 13.
- I'm thrilled you're on the team.
- What team?
What is this place?
Officially, K-39 triple-Z on the North American grid.
But...
I like to think of it as America's attic.
Projet-SG (1.00)
Pete, close the door.
Tell me exactly what I'm doing here.
Exactly?
That's a little dif...
Well, to put it plainly, you're both joining me as fellow gatherers and protectors of secrets.
Put it plainer.
This...
This warehouse...
Look, the Warehouse needs you.
It needs...
Pete, don't touch.
It needs your combined talents.
He's intuitive, and you're...
You've got a scrupulous eye for detail.
He's scattershot, and you're meticulous.
You look, he leaps.
There's been a mistake.
I'm too valuable to be wasted here.
No offense.
- Of course not.
- Can I use your phone, please?
Mine?
It's broken.
- I have to make a phone call, so...
- There's no signal here.
Yeah, you're...
You're...
Just pull...
Pull the door, and you'll be... now.
There you go.
I think she had other plans.
So did I.
You want juice or are you a milk person?
- You know what I'd really like?
- I do indeed, but falling off the wagon may not be the best option at this point.
- Milk it is.
- Yeah.
- That's Mrs. Frederic.
- Long time ago.
- She looks exactly the same.
- Odd, isn't it?
You don't want a cookie?
- So who are these guys?
- Former colleagues.
And where are they now?
This one and this one are dead.
This one, a mental institution in Germany.
And this last one... disappeared.
One day I'll find him.
Ted, these are two of my best agents.
How can you not know?
I'm looking at the order.
You processed it.
How can't you know?
Hold on.
- Dickinson.
- Sir, it's Myka Bering.
Sir, I have a little situation here.
I'm not sure...
Yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I'm looking at the transfer order.
The name on here is Frederic.
You're transferred to where?
- Where are you?
- I'm in South Dakota.
- Where?
- South Dakota.
- What are you doing in South Dakota?
- You don't know about this?
No.
Who is Frederic?
Sir?
Sir?
- Who's this Frederic?
- Sir!
Yes, yes.
She handed me orders last night to come here to a warehouse in South Dakota.
The order code was solid, and Lattimer's here too.
Look, I'm requesting an immediate stand down and transfer back to DC.
Myka.
Myka, I can't do that, okay?
This order trumps me.
Let me get on this, I'll get you back here asap.
- What should I do?
- Follow orders.
- Those orders, both of you.
- And how long will this take?
Sir?
Sir?
Are you still there?
That's a pile of crap.
- No kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.
You're actually standing in a big pile of cow manure.
- Oatmeal scotchie?
- No.
Thank you.
I don't eat sugar.
Good for you.
Listen...
Please don't think of this assignment, you know, as some sort of punishment.
- Can you hold this?
- What?
You know, yeah, your presence here is not really a reaction to what happened to you in Denver.
So...
I got a commendation for what happened in Denver.
Yes, you did.
It's time for the nickel tour.
Come on.
The order trumps Dickinson?
The first Warehouse 13 was built in '98.
- So we're stuck.
- Until he works out a transfer, yes.
1898.
We didn't have a handle on how to store stuff.
It burned down.
Some remodeling and excavations were necessary as the years went on to accommodate the arrival of more and more and more and more artifacts.
What's stored here, exactly?
This and that.
Bric-a-brac.
Some things along the lines of... last night's rock and roll.
I'm talking about the blood stone.
Both hands... on the bar, please.
I think I'll survive a crash.
No, that's not a safety bar.
It's a conduit.
You and Pete are the power source.
Your combined electrical energy makes this thing move.
It's fine, it's fine.
Look, Thomas Edison built this automobile for Henry Ford as a proof of concept, and it's perfectly safe.
Trust me.
Put your hands on the bar.
Put your hands on the bar.
Thank you.
We need both of you.
Hands on the bar, Myka.
Thank you.
Edison, he wanted Ford to let go of oil, but Ford, no, no, he stuck with it because it ruined his engines faster.
People had to keep buying them.
- What is that?
- What?
That is training flight 22.
We pulled that from the Bermuda Triangle.
The Triangle's been trying to pull it back ever since.
Duck and cover.
It's harmless.
The inventory kicks up a little static from time to time.
Why are you grinning?
Well, don't you think this stuff is kind of cool?
I mean...
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He'll be back.
- Hello?
- We should stick together.
Right this way, please.
Many of the items in here, kind of like the blood stone, Pete, that you wrestled with last night, the channel of tangential energy...
Well, tangential energy is kind of like the energy that forced the museum employee, last night, into... well, into almost committing murder.
- So how does that happen?
- We're not really exactly sure how.
It goes back to Einstein, and E equals...
Yeah, okay.
Somehow... the matter that is in here has just enough energy to move other matter.
You know, like you.
- Move me where?
- Into trouble.
Bunk.
Is gravity bunk?
Magnetism?
These are mysterious forces that we live with, but we can't explain 'em.
Can you even explain to me how a radio works?
And you don't care, as long as you get the traffic report.
But if a radio landed in the hands of Thomas Jefferson, you know what Jefferson would do?
He would just lock it up until he figured out it wasn't gonna kill him.
And that is exactly... what we do here.
We take the unexplained... and we just safely tuck it away in this super-sized Pandora's box.
- Metaphorically speaking.
- Pandora's box is over in aisle 989B.
Empty, of course.
Do the world a favor and clear your mind.
Well, that should be easy.
How did that get there?
'Cause I didn't pick that thing up.
It still amazes me how that thing moves.
What?
What is it?
Don't talk, don't hope, don't wish for anything.
- That kettle grants wishes?
- Yes.
Now Pete, look at me.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Open it.
Pete!
Pete, this...
This is a neutralizer.
You can think of this as a fire extinguisher for objects that act up.
Now look, I want you to come over here and drop that slowly, right in here.
There are items around here, if you were to put it in there, they would generate a flash, but this will be a little spark.
But you may flinch, and I don't want to, 'cause you could drop it, okay?
- Well, I have a wish.
- Don't!
- You wished for a ferret?
- No.
- That was already in the thing.
- I don't think so.
You wished for a transfer, didn't you?
Impossible wishes, wishes that can never be granted, they produce a ferret.
Don't ask me why.
My first year here, the whole place was crawling with ferrets.
- I swear, I didn't pick that thing up.
- No, I know, I know.
Not everybody is affected by everything.
Here, okay?
You have to be metaphysically predisposed.
And the external energies, they have to be in alignment.
- This is just a convergence thing.
- Right, sure, okay.
So we're...
we're all converged here, but I still have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
What you're supposed to do is hunt down whatever is threatening to ruin the world's day, neutralize it and bring it here.
You gotta snag it and bag it and tag it.
This is crazy!
This is crazy!
You know, I don't...
It could be, you know, crazy fun.
That's the attitude that brought you to our attention.
Do you guys want a cookie for the road?
What road?
There's rooms for you at Leena's Bed and Breakfast.
It's about 7 miles down the road that way, and I'll join you there in the morning and I'll tou...
I'll just join you there in the morning.
Stay close!
Seriously, Lattimer, there's been a serious screw-up.
I'm serious.
And now you have a ferret.
What?
This town...
Is this a town or what?
- What's the name of it?
- Well, it's more like a street.
So it says here to turn left at Buffalo Station.
What?
No, no, no.
It's "Buffalo Statue".
Well, your penmanship is atrocious.
I don't need wise...
You know, that's...
You know, don't do that.
Can you finish a sentence?
A full thought?
Would you really like me to?
Wait.
No, no, no.
Don't... don't call Dickinson.
- He hates being pestered.
- I don't pester.
When he knows something, he'll call.
Clearly the phrase "rolling with the punches"
is not in your vocabulary, so may I make a suggestion?
What might that be?
Unbunch your panties... and make the best of a bad situation.
And how do I do that?
Which part?
You're a freak.
Hello.
I'm Leena.
You must be Pete and Myka.
Come in.
I've got your rooms ready.
We serve three meals, 9:00, noon, and 5:00.
We've got radios in the rooms.
No tvs.
No in-room phones, but there is one there at the bottom of the stairs in the hallway.
You may choose any room.
Is there anywhere I can get a drink?
I mean, a drink... drink?
- What would you like?
- Whiskey neat.
- I can do that.
- Please do that.
She hates traveling.
She loves traveling.
It's the places she's traveled to that's the problem.
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm fine.
Just...
- Is everything okay?
- You're a lucky man, Pete.
I am?
You're in tune.
Very rare.
I don't know what that mea...
Look... are you... are you connected to Artie?
Let me know if your bed is big enough for you.
Hey, buddy.
- How'd it go today?
- Not bad.
Lattimer seems interested.
And Ms. Bering, not so much.
Did you select a case for them?
I don't mean any disrespect, but are we really sure they're the right people?
Because...
I'm fully aware of their baggage.
Now what's the real problem?
Artie, take yourself off the hook.
Their fate falls on me.
You say that...
Dickinson wants them back.
You've got to get them locked in.
Can't sleep?
Yeah.
Me neither.
We don't have to talk.
So...
- Do you always eat when stressed?
- Do you always talk this much?
You know, no light from the city to get in the way.
Nothing but sky.
This time of the year, we get Leo,
Cygnus, Sagittarius.
You know this how?
My dad and I used to camp a lot.
Where is he now?
Sorry.
What about your folks?
Colorado Springs.
They own a bookstore called Bering and Sons.
- How many brothers?
- No brothers.
Just me.
My dad thought the "and Sons" sounded classier.
He must be proud of you.
Mom is.
Well, did protecting the president of the United States turn him around?
This won't.
From Denver to DC to a warehouse security guard in six months.
Now there's a career trajectory.
Look, about Denver,
I didn't mean to spit on that last night.
What you did there was better than textbook.
We're not discussing that.
Ever.
All right, well, I'm gonna... go back upstairs... and not sleep some more.
Earlier, did you hear a...
Hear what?
Never mind.
Dickinson will call.
He better.
Rotation, time,
Seever City.
Come on.
So it's gonna be you, then.
Cody Thomas, a law school grad student, at the university of Southern Iowa.
- Iowa?
- Yeah, Iowa.
His parents were killed in a plane crash.
He is a really good kid, putting himself through college with the settlement.
Why are we going to Iowa?
To find whatever it is that pushed this kid over the edge.
- What edge?
- He struck his girlfriend.
That's it?
So far.
For the past five days, I have been reviewing 11 possible cases, looking for whatever doesn't fit, something out of place, like blood on a marble floor that leads to a man with a knife.
Because of a rock that isn't just a rock.
I've got a hunch that this is the one.
What exactly are we looking for?
Well, you tell me.
It's bigger than a breadbox...
Or smaller.
If there is an artifact at the heart of this, then I've prepared a few questions for Cody that might reveal it.
Actually, it's more than a few questions, but...
"Do you have the constant feeling that today is yesterday?"
If they say yes, then we could...
They probably won't say yes.
It's unlikely.
- We could be dealing with time slip.
- Or a hangover.
Please take this seriously.
I had a run-in with a Mayan calendar few years ago, that question saved my life.
And the two agents that were with me were not quite so lucky.
What happened to them?
Their clocks...
Stopped.
So, what?
They died?
They'll wish they had in 100 years or so.
Anyway...
Neutralizer.
The purple stuff.
If you find the artifact, just drown it in there, like this, if you can.
And if it's too big, you just take this and throw it, and then call me.
And don't ask me how it works, because I have no idea.
And it doesn't always work.
And don't ingest that stuff, because you'll... see things.
And we'll stay in contact with these.
I have one just like it.
- Two-way video communication?
- I call it a Farnsworth.
Named after Philo Farnsworth, who invented that in 1929, right after he invented the television.
Isn't that remarkable?
I mean, anyway, if you wanna talk to me, just press that button.
What is that?
Nicola Tesla,
Thomas Edison's chief rival or nemesis, depending, he cooked this up as an alternative to bullets.
It's a...
It's really... a kind of electric stun gun.
A polyphase ass-kicker.
Now, that's...
Just here.
Just don't put it past two to begin with.
That's the trigger, right there.
You should practice with it first.
One blast and down you go.
Don't point that at me.
Keep your finger away.
Just don't.
Give him the gun.
And also, it zaps short-term memory, which is why agent Morris doesn't remember seeing me at the museum.
And that's it.
That's what?
Go to Iowa.
Talk to Cody.
Find the artifact, if it exists.
Neutralize it and bring it back.
Don't get killed.
- How's her aura?
- Tortured.
Guilt and grief, mostly.
She has a soft spot for the ferret.
Just like you.
Now that was a long time ago.
You haven't changed that much.
She had a stowaway.
I found this in her room.
Oh, Lord, that's Houdini's wallet.
Fingers!
That was a bad spike.
That landed on something with her.
I requisitioned mesh screens for those shelves ten years ago.
And every year since.
- I've told you this.
- A few times.
You'd think Mrs. Frederic could maybe get that done.
Don't look at me.
Well, I had the FBI in here a while ago on a suspected terrorist thing.
All egos out to here and all looking like they're wearing daddy's suit.
Well, we feel the same way.
Let me know if the thing's going federal so I can prepare my staff for the media.
It's not going federal.
We just have a few questions and then we're gone.
It's Dickinson.
- Just a sec.
- Yeah, this is Bering.
- How you doing?
- We're in Iowa now, on assignment.
- Any luck in getting us back?
- The bad news is not so far.
The good news is, I've got a line on this Frederic woman.
She worked for the Treasury Department in the 1950s, and after...
Well, it's not the same woman.
The woman we met was younger.
I've got a Frederic in charge of some sort of secret sandbox.
Funded from a black ops budget I'm still trying to source.
I can fill you in.
These lines aren't secure.
Listen to me.
I'm doing everything I can to get you and Pete back here.
48 hours, tops.
So just follow your current orders and keep your head down.
Wait, sir!
Sir?
So how'd he sound?
48 hours.
- Yeah, but how'd he sound?
- Not good.
- What kind of questions?
- They're sort of diagnostic.
Diagnostic.
Like I'm sick?
You're Secret Service doctors?
Question number one.
"Have you recently encountered something that you feel has affected your life?"
Something like...
An object of some kind.
Do handcuffs count?
Question number two. "While looking up, do you have the sensation of falling?"
I don't feel like I'm falling.
- Next question.
- Okay, question number three.
"Have you recently smelled something that could best be described
- "as fudge when there is no fudge?"
- Fudge?
Is that...
Question four.
"Do you have ever feel like this might be a colossal waste of time?"
Okay, so...
We're done with those questions...
What do you think happened with your girlfriend?
- What's her name?
- I don't know.
Emily.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
I was in class, talking to the professor about some mock trial thing.
I woke up here, and they told me I beat Emily up.
- Have they let you see a doctor?
- Yeah.
- Says I'm fine.
- And no...
- No alcohol or drugs?
- No, I swear.
No history of blackouts?
This isn't me.
I would never hurt Emily.
This isn't me.
This isn't...
Se li uomini sapessino le cagioni della paura mia, capir potrebbero il mio dolor.
Get him out of here!
Let's get him down to secure lockup.
Well, that was scary.
Can you come this way, son?
Hello.
I'm Lorna Soliday.
I'm Cody's lawyer.
And did Travis call you?
Sheriff Travis respects the law, and he doesn't like being railroaded by federal agents.
Are you that hands-on with all your clients?
- Just my godson.
- So you knew his parents.
Very well.
And neither Cody nor I will be answering any more questions
- until I know what this is about.
- We're interested in Cody's behavior.
- His violent behavior.
- As in, where's it coming from?
What is this?
Someone pegged him as a threat to the President?
Not yet.
Not ever.
That's not Cody.
It was Cody that just destroyed that table.
Not to mention what he did to his girlfriend.
Does the secret service investigate every case
- of battery among college students?
- Nope.
Just this one.
- So where'd the Italian come in?
- What do you mean?
He spoke Italian in there, just before he decided
- that the interview was over.
- I don't know anything about that.
Well, has Cody come into contact with anything unusual, say, in the past few days?
- Yes.
You two.
- That was a serious question.
That was a serious answer.
Any more questions, Sheriff Travis has my number.
You felt that, right?
I'm not sure what you mean.
It got hot.
But you knew to get me to the floor before he freaked out.
The vibe.
Right.
Okay, so how do those things work?
Is there false alarms or...
- It happens all the time.
- So why do you trust them?
One time I didn't, and I should have.
You're right.
It's Italian, sort of.
I mean, this is either part gibberish.
I don't know.
It's some kind of code, maybe.
And my software can barely translate any of this and says "dolor"
means "pain."
And a text search came up with nothing.
There's no films, no books, no plays, no songs, no poems.
So what now?
You're right beside a college campus.
You can go find somebody who speaks Italian.
Excuse me.
Professor Marzotto?
We're with the secret service.
Oh, my.
It's an old construction.
15th century.
It's not working-class Italian either.
This is high brow.
- So what's he saying?
- Roughly?
"If people knew
"the reasons for my fear,
"they'd be able to understand my pain."
Do you visit Italy a lot?
I haven't been back in nearly two years.
But you're sure this translation is correct.
I'm a Renaissance scholar.
I'm sure.
One last question.
Do you know a student here named Cody Thomas?
I know of him.
I read about him in the paper.
It's a sad story.
- How so?
- Well, you know.
He was a good kid, from what I heard.
And he had some sort of a breakdown.
All right, well, if we need you to translate anything else...
I'd be more than happy to help.
You can reach me at that number.
Great.
Thank you.
He's hiding something.
Did you see his neck pulse?
Don't you have a scrupulous eye for detail.
- He shelves his books alphabetically.
- I didn't notice that.
And he puts pens in one cup, pencils in another.
Now you're scaring me.
Did you see where he put his pen right before we left?
Was Sherlock Holmes a big deal at your parents' bookstore?
- Something got Marzotto going.
- And you.
I don't like being lied to.
I'll remember that.
Do you want to go back and hit him again?
No, I want a hard phone line.
I thought this was a colossal waste of time.
Not anymore.
Hold up.
- Do you always walk so fast?
- Yes, I do.
Are you coming?
I have an incoming code Madrid for Minnie Harris.
Reply 6955.
- Hi, Minnie.
- Hey, hotshot.
- How's the White House?
- You know, it's a lot smaller than it looks on TV.
How are you?
- Chad and I are dating.
- Very nice.
Yes, it is.
- Look, I need some information.
- Okay, shoot.
Edward Marzotto, one "z" two "t"s.
- Professor at Southern Iowa University.
- Turnaround?
I need it now.
Sorry, I know this is big.
It's not a problem.
Hang on and I'll give you the highlights?
- For sure.
- Thanks.
Hang on.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Government agents are asking me lots of questions I can't answer without getting you and me into a lot of trouble.
It's about the book.
Your boyfriend is quoting from it.
How's Myka?
Edgy, irritable.
You know, Myka.
- Why?
- Just checking.
Listen, there's something I forgot to mention before.
- What?
- Just before Cody got physical, there was some kind of a...
I don't know, a heat wave.
It just rolled right off of him.
This happen after a question?
No, he was talking about his girlfriend, Emily Krueger.
- You talked to her, right?
- No, not yet.
All right.
Listen,
I'm gonna check out that heat thing, and see if that relates to anything.
And... meanwhile, what was that translation?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
Do you want me to...
Do you want me to run that again?
I got it.
You're positive that's the translation?
Absolutely positive?
Yeah, I mean, that's what Marzotto said.
- I'll call you back.
- Okay.
Got some good stuff.
Edward Melville Marzotto.
- Melville?
- Yeah, I know.
Anyway, the man loves his Italian art.
He just got back from Italy eight weeks ago, and the cops think...
Hey, bunny.
- Slow down.
- Walk faster.
So what'd you find out?
What happened in there?
Tell me.
I heard a...
I thought I heard... a voice over the phone that I really should not be hearing.
Same thing you heard at Leena's.
Look, sometimes we...
We hear things
- and see things that aren't there.
- What I heard can't be there.
- It can't be.
- Then it's not.
I mean, maybe it's post-traumatic stress.
I read the press release of what went down in Denver.
- Lives were saved.
- Lives were lost.
You're a hero.
You're gonna put me on a psych eval, aren't you?
Why would I do that?
Because you need to be able to depend on your partner.
All right, well, then you're just gonna have to depend on me to know that you're okay.
We're gonna finish this case, we're gonna get out of here.
We will.
I don't know if I can.
I don't even know what we're looking for.
Yes, you do.
I mean, whatever doesn't fit.
You know, something that's out of place.
Marzotto lied to us.
He said that the last time
- he was in Italy was...
- Two years ago.
Yeah, my contact told me it was eight weeks ago.
How'bout that?
I wonder what else he lied about.
- I guess we need more information.
- Yes, we do.
- Cody's girlfriend.
- Emily Krueger.
I need a picture!
Just give me a picture.
Give me a picture.
Don't make me come down there!
All right.
I know this is... awkward.
And I feel terrible, but...
You can't keep it.
I don't know what I was thinking even taking it out of Italy, but it has to go back.
I'm going to Rome next week.
And that's coming with me.
What's that for?
I hate this part.
- Emily, you're late.
- Sorry.
We were setting up for the party.
Can I help you?
Emily Krueger?
I know your pain, trust me.
We saw you leaving professor Marzotto's office, didn't we?
Oh, right.
I was there for a meeting.
For the play.
I'm in it.
Marzotto's sort of a technical advisor.
Does he know about your relationship with Cody?
He knows what happened.
Why?
Because when we talked to him about Cody, he didn't mention you.
Or that you'd just been to see him.
Maybe he was trying to protect my privacy.
- Why did you guys mention Cody?
- We needed something translated.
Yeah, have you ever heard Cody speak Italian?
Just once, when he did this.
- How long have you known Cody?
- Since the eighth grade.
Got serious after his parents died.
I came here for theater.
He applied for law school.
His godmother helped him get in.
- Lorna Soliday?
- You met her?
- Does she have any family?
- Just Cody.
And that's not even real family.
She made sure that he got that big settlement when his parents died.
Do you know what it means?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Only that he's afraid of abandonment.
It scares him.
Maybe he thought that I was spending too much time on the play.
I don't know.
Can I go back to work now?
Ten to one this has nothing to do with the hocus pocus Artie's pushing.
How'bout a billion to one?
How about a cute girl in a play by Machiavelli makes her insecure boyfriend freak out?
Or... or try this.
Emily, an actress, is a ruthless gold digger.
She'd know which buttons to push on her insecure boyfriend to get him made enough to hit her.
She goes for the money.
Sues him for it.
What kind of women do you date?
- It's Marzotto.
- What?
The attendant said he heard him speaking Italian before he doused himself.
Hold on.
Why'd you talk to marzotto?
Who told you that?
Secret service hits campus, and people notice.
And now he's dead.
Before this, you said something to make Cody want to knock your heads off.
- Something you want to tell me?
- We should talk later.
- Let me tell you something...
- Sure.
Something that makes it seem like I couldn't kick your ass in front of your men.
Boys, can we put our badges back in our pants, please?
Sheriff.
What was that?
- We gotta get to Marzotto's office.
- And how are we gonna get in?
Hotshot.
What the hell is Warehouse 13?
We haven't met.
I'm Mrs. Frederic.
- How'd you get in here?
- Through a door.
Warehouse 13, is it yours?
It's mine.
And so are Lattimer and Bering.
Excuse me?
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
Never mind.
The vibe thing?
My dad was a... fireman.
When I was 12,
I got this feeling one morning that I was never gonna see him again.
And you didn't say anything?
I didn't want him to see how scared I was.
He died that night in a house fire, saving a couple of kids.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
So now when you get a feeling...
- He got his pen out of his pencil cup.
- At least he died happy.
That's not funny.
You're right.
That's strange.
What?
The "m"s are out of order.
There's something in there.
- Is this it?
- I don't know.
- Well, what if it is?
- Then we're done.
- So open it.
- You open it.
I don't want another ferret or whatever.
- Se li uomini...
- Don't.
Just in case.
- What's that?
- Something's missing.
Let's call Artie.
Miss Soliday.
- What are you doing here?
- You heard what happened to Marzotto?
Yes, Sheriff Travis just called.
Now get out before I call him back and tell him you're searching this office without a warrant.
We're here investigating his suicide.
Ed didn't kill himself.
- He had help.
- What do you mean?
Somebody broke his heart.
We were together for three years.
And then we weren't.
I thought we were in love, but things change, and he chose someone else.
A student?
Did Emily Krueger break his heart?
And Cody's.
She's a despicable young woman who uses people to get what she wants, and then when she's done using them...
We're looking for something, something about this big.
We think Marzotto had it, but now it's missing.
Did Emily get it, you know, whatever it is?
Why don't you ask her?
She's helping with the party for the play.
Cody's there.
- Cody's out?
- Emily dropped the charges.
- Okay, we should go.
- I'm coming with you.
If you're confronting Emily, I need to be there for Cody.
Let's go.
I gotta lose weight.
Do you think Emily would ever hurt Cody?
Not physically.
Even if she tried, she couldn't.
And why not?
Me.
Cody has me.
I made a promise to his parents when I became his godmother that I would always be there to protect him.
It's only a matter of time before Cody realizes
Emily's just small-town trash.
Cody is destined for great things, and I'm helping him succeed.
With me, he can do anything or be anyone he wants.
Could you pull over for a sec?
I know you.
Well, that's a good sign.
Where am I?
Hospital.
In Iowa.
Seever City.
What happened?
Car accident.
You've been out for two days.
How's Pete?
Lattimer's still unconscious.
We don't know.
There's someone here to see you.
Someone who's gonna help you get back to where you belong.
The President?
Better.
Hey, bunny.
Hey.
You know you shouldn't be here, right?
I could say the same thing about you.
I think you just did.
I'm hurt.
That didn't stop you in Denver.
- I was late.
- No, bunny.
I was early.
I jumped the gun.
You're dead, Sam.
You need to get up now.
You got a lot of things you need to do.
Get up.
You have to get up now.
Get up.
Wake up, buddy.
Can you hear me?
Come on.
Here we go.
All right.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?
What?
What?
- You're giving me a wedgie.
- What?
Just... you okay?
Sit here and don't move.
I'm just gonna get the book.
If you find a badge, it's mine.
Never mind.
I found it.
You okay?
Soliday crashed the car.
You think?
Where is she?
She's not here.
She had... some kind of jewelry in her hair, like a comb thing.
It looked old, like it would fit in the book.
- Pete, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Just... here, answer that.
You're looking for jewelry.
This, this thing.
Yeah, we know.
We just saw it in a woman's hair.
- She tried to kill us.
- A woman?
What woman?
Her name is Lorna Soliday.
She's...
Part of the ruling class, single, successful, middle-aged.
She's a survivor of family tragedies and the death of loved ones.
She's connected somehow to a young man, that she believes needs her protection?
He's good, yeah.
What's the matter with you two?
Okay, anyway, look.
This comb is transmitting Lucretia Borgia.
- Lucretia who?
- Borgia.
She's a cutthroat Italian who ruled Italy in the 1600s with her father and brothers.
My family owned a book store, remember?
That's right.
So what do you mean the comb's transmitting?
An alchemist made it, okay?
Out of what, I don't know.
It's supposed to be some kind of Renaissance roofie.
Somehow the crystals in the ionized metal are affecting brain chemistry.
- What about the phrase?
- Yeah, the phrase.
That's like some kind of phonetic trigger.
This is a very, very, very unhappy woman.
Very unlucky in love.
- There's supposed to be a jewelry box.
- We found it in Marzotto's office.
He must have given Soliday the comb.
Like her, she wants love at any cost.
She wants love, and she is gonna kill to get it.
She wants...
She wants Cody, so she wants Emily gone.
And Emily's at the party.
What are you talking about a party?
What party?
God.
Some renaissance blowout for some Machiavelli play.
Machia...
This woman's gonna be there?
You've gotta stop this woman.
Lucretia Borgia, 600 years ago, started a bloody reign of terror, and this comb is gonna wanna start it all over again.
It's got twisted desires, and it'll amplify, it'll spread like some kind of orgiastic virus.
First to Iowa, then to Nebraska, then to Illinois.
We understand.
Probably first to Illinois and then...
Okay, look, we need to get you to a hospital first and...
No, look, I'm trained to take a bullet if necessary.
But...
I'm not sure how to stop a dead Italian cougar.
We need some kind of approach.
Well, I have no more color-coded plans.
There's a silver lining.
Okay, I'll go in, grab Cody.
- You flank.
- No, you flank.
Trust me.
That's not creepy.
How you doing?
That's nice.
Come on, man, you don't wanna do this.
Look.
You don't wanna hurt her.
Just let Emily go.
He intends to.
Her dying scream will be the trigger...
Look, nobody's screaming, okay?
We're gonna take a deep breath, and we're all gonna come back down to Earth.
Cute.
Kid's fast.
What's your pain, Lorna?
What are you afraid of?
You know.
And so does she.
Show's over.
Drop the comb... thing.
Did you really let your lover die?
- Shut up.
- For a chance at glory?
I said shut up.
Don't look at it, Myka.
Yeah, sorry.
No one's dying here tonight.
But you might lose a tooth.
Duck and cover?
- What did I do?
- It's okay.
It's over.
Love hurts, I know.
So here's the deal.
You got a choice.
You can come back to DC.
Or you can stay with the new assignment.
- What's the catch?
- I only get you.
Lattimer has to stay there.
- And if I stay, what happens to Pete?
- He still stays.
- How long do I have to think about it?
- About five more seconds.
Four, three, two.
{\pos(270,240)}Now, in addition to all the museums and art galleries and other great stuff here in our nation's capital, there's one thing you're gonna love probably more than anything else... the dinosaurs.
This way.
Stick together.
Agent Bering?
- Hi, Chet Greenfield.
- Hello.
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.
My assistant said you double-checked everything yesterday.
I did, but I'd like to run a full review before we lock it down.
Sure.
- With you.
- Me?
You're the boss.
I'd like to avoid any chain-of-command confusion.
I tell you, and it gets done.
- Shall we start in the main hall?
- Well, I understand,
- but I'm pretty booked up{\ at the moment}right now.
- I apologize for the inconvenience.
- I'll clear my schedule.
- I'd appreciate that, sir.
Good morning, Kacey.
I just figured out who you are.
You're a fireman.
No.
Come on.
You know absolutely everything about me.
Well, that's because you talk a lot.
Gordon, this is agent Bering with the Secret Service.
Gordon Letanik?
And what's...
What's this?
An Aztec blood stone.
The boss of virgin sacrifices.
Handsome devil.
I'm just cleaning him for the reception tonight.
Agent Bering wants the group D artifacts moved to the west wall.
They're blocking an exit.
Lose Tuvalu and Malta.
Move Britain to the back.
If it still doesn't fit, see me and we'll cut something else.
Yes, sir.
I'll just finish up.
What's next?
The main floor bathrooms.
I'll need the plumbing pulled again.
I would try to sneak you in, but the Secret Service will be there, and they can be jerks.
So I've heard.
Call you soon.
You promise?
Promise.
Bye now.
Champagne?
Thank you.
Champagne?
Cham...
Status check on Eagle.
- Who's on Emerald entrance?
- Me.
Morris.
Why aren't you at Emerald?
Well, because I'm here.
- How's Home Base?
- We're calling Home Base "Magenta".
Well, I'm not.
- You changed the protocol.
- I tweaked it.
I wrote it.
And I didn't use colors.
Why weren't you at my briefing?
I was vetting one of the servers.
- Screwing off is more like it.
- Well, you say po-tah-to.
- Get back to Emerald.
- You're not my superior.
Dickinson gave this to me.
I'm running it.
- Meeka.
- Myka.
I get... vibes.
Sorry?
This isn't some run and gun that you're used to in Denver.
- Get to the point, Lattimer.
- Dickinson gave you this shindig with my protocol because my specialty is logistics, framing... and I kid you not, there is something really off in here.
Eagle at Magenta.
Mr. President, wait a moment, please.
This is Bering.
Eagle is free to enter.
Negative, negative.
This is Lattimer.
Hold Eagle at five until further.
- Copy?
- Copy{\ that}.
Holding Eagle.
Get back to Emerald.
Look, Myka, why don't you pull your head out of your Magenta and feel the room.
- Something's off.
- Listen, Showboat.
Nothing's off.
The room is fine.
Everything is fine.
Now take your vibe... and go.
- Enjoy your party.
- I will.
I want a perimeter check asap.
- Emerald clear.
- Peach clear.
- Orange clear.
- Gold clear.
Crimson clear.
There's...
There's blood, so...
Pete?
- What are you doing here?
- Working.
Is there a fire?
- Excuse me, sir.
Wait just a second.
- Secret Service.
This is...
Gotta go.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
That's an okay for Eagle to enter.
Affirmative.
Clear Eagle.
Freeze!
Drop the knife.
Hold your fire!
Seriously, Gordon, drop the knife.
Drop that.
- Whatever it is.
- Can't do that, Pete.
Weapon.
We're done here.
Tell me you found the guy.
The guy who you said stole the rock?
We're gonna need a sample.
Come on, Dickinson.
Well, you said, among many strange things,
- that the rock was bleeding.
- It was.
Taxpayers will probably wanna know if you were high, paranoid, or just part of an Aztec art theft ring.
In the meantime, you're suspended, with pay, for two weeks, till we get this thing worked out.
- What about Morris?
- He says nothing happened at emerald.
Okay, can we... stop with the colors already?
What about...
the guy with the knife?
- What, Letanik?
- Yes.
He's in a coma.
Docs don't know why or how long that's gonna last.
- And Bering?
- Myka's being thanked personally by the President and the first lady.
- Of course she is.
- She's going places.
You, on the other hand, you're going to the bathroom.
That's funny.
Mr. Lattimer.
My name's Frederic.
Frederic what?
- Mrs. Frederic.
- Well, that's a relief.
I'm with the government.
I'm here on a matter of national security.
- What's that?
- An invitation to endless wonder.
Could you sound a little more creepy?
Read it.
Please note the action code.
It is legitimate.
- You're part of my bailiwick now.
- Your bailiwick?
- You're working for me.
- For you?
- Am I stuttering?
- No, ma'am.
All right, I get it.
It's a... this is a joke, right?
Dickinson put you guys up...
This is Dickinson being funny, right?
Do I look like a joke?
You're to be in South Dakota at those coordinates at noon tomorrow.
You will mention our meeting and your pending assignment to no one.
Is that understood?
How long am I gonna be in South Dakota?
- Indefinitely.
- Indef... no, no.
I've got a life here.
Really?
I've got... things.
Pack light, Mr. Lattimer.
We'll ship what you need and store the rest.
Prepare to turn right in 100 feet.
Turn right now.
You have missed your turn.
Go back.
Turn right.
Destination straight ahead.
You gotta be kidding me.
Endless wonder.
It's agent Lattimer!
I'm here!
Great.
- I heard you were suspended.
- Yeah, I heard that too.
Why are you here?
I was ordered here, last night.
Mrs. Frederic.
Said it was a matter of...
National security.
Right.
How are you guys doing?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to fix the fish.
- Stop right there.
- What are you doing?
This is the guy.
{\You know, }The one from last night.
- The guy who stole the rock.
- You stole the rock.
It's a blood stone.
It's safe.
It's inside the building.
It's the property of the museum.
And that museum is property of the{\ US} Government, so is the warehouse.
And so am I.
I'm secret service.
I also work for Mrs. Frederic.
I'm Dr. Nielson.
You can call me Artie.
Got some ID?
We take the secret part seriously around here.
I just wanted to thank you for your assist in last night's retrieval.
That was very good.
Did you throw that foot ball at me?
You weren't here when I threw it.
It takes a while to circle back.
Come on inside.
- I'll show you around.
- Around what?
What am I doing here?
I'll explain everything inside.
Come on.
I made cookies.
Come on.
Really, it's okay.
Go inside.
Don't go far!
Okay.
Come on in.
Wait for me at the bottom of the stairs.
It's fine.
Don't touch anything.
Don't touch the bombs.
Hold this.
Hold it.
Come on.
It's okay.
Right this way.
Ms. Bering, Mr. Lattimer, welcome to Warehouse 13.
- I'm thrilled you're on the team.
- What team?
What is this place?
Officially, K-39 triple-Z on the North American grid.
But...
I like to think of it as America's attic.
Projet-SG (1.00)
Pete, close the door.
Tell me exactly what I'm doing here.
{\pos(192,235)}Exactly?
That's a little dif... {\pos(192,235)}Well, to put it plainly,
{\pos(192,235)}you're both joining me as fellow gatherers and protectors of secrets.
Put it plainer.
{\pos(192,235)}This...
This warehouse... {\pos(192,235)}{\Well, }Look, the Warehouse needs you.
It needs...
Pete, don't touch.
{\pos(192,235)}It needs your combined talents.
{\I mean, }He's intuitive, and you're... {\pos(192,235)}{\I mean, }You've got a scrupulous eye for detail.
He's scattershot, {\ you see, }and you're meticulous.
You look, he leaps.
There's been a mistake.
I'm too valuable to be wasted here.
No offense.
- Of course not.
- Can I use your phone, please?
{\pos(192,235)}Mine?
{\pos(192,235)}It's broken.
{\pos(192,235)}- {\Well, }I have to make a phone call, so...
- There's no signal here.
{\pos(192,235)}Yeah, you're...
You're...
Just pull...
Pull the door, and you'll be... now.
There you go.
I think she had other plans.
So did I.
You want juice or are you a milk person?
- You know what I'd really like?
- I do indeed, but falling off the wagon may not be the best option at this point.
- Milk it is.
- Yeah.
- That's Mrs. Frederic.
- Long time ago.
- She looks exactly the same.
- Odd, isn't it?
You don't want a cookie?
- So who are these guys?
- Former colleagues.
{\pos(192,225)}And where are they now?
This one and this one are dead.
This one, a mental institution in Germany.
And this last one... {\pos(192,205)}disappeared.
One day I'll find him.
Ted, these are two of my best agents.
How can you not know?
I'm looking at the order.
You processed it.
How {\*can you not}can't you know?
Hold on.
- Dickinson.
- Sir, it's Myka Bering.
Sir, I have a little situation here.
I'm not sure...
Yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I'm looking at the transfer order{\ right now}.
{\pos(192,220)}The name on here is Frederic.
You're transferred to where?
{\pos(192,220)}
- Where are you?
- {\Well, }I'm in South Dakota.
{\pos(192,220)}
- Where?
- South Dakota.
{\pos(192,220)}
- What are you doing in South Dakota?
- You don't know about this?
No.
Who is Frederic?
Sir?
Sir?
{\pos(192,205)}
- Who's this Frederic?
- Sir!
Yes, yes.
{\pos(192,205)}She handed me orders last night to come here to a warehouse in South Dakota.
The order code was solid, and Lattimer's here too.
Look, I'm requesting an immediate stand down and transfer back to DC.
{\pos(192,185)}Myka.
Myka, I can't do that, okay?
This order trumps me.
Let me get on this, {\and }I'll get you back here asap.
- What should I do?
- Follow orders.
- {\pos(192,205)}Those orders, both of you.
- And how long will this take?
Sir?
Sir?
Are you still there?
{\pos(192,225)}That's a pile of crap.
{\pos(192,225)}
- No kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.
You're actually standing in a big pile of cow manure.
- Oatmeal scotchie?
- No.
Thank you.
I don't eat sugar.
Good for you.
Listen...
Please don't think of this assignment, you know, as some sort of punishment.
- Can you hold this?
- What?
You know, yeah, your presence here is not really a reaction to what happened to you in Denver.
So...
I got a commendation for what happened in Denver.
Yes, you did.
It's time for the nickel tour.
Come on.
The order trumps Dickinson?
The first Warehouse 13 was built in '98.
- So we're stuck.
- Until he works out a transfer, yes.
1898.
We didn't have a handle on how to store stuff.
It burned down.
Some remodeling and excavations were necessary as the years went on to accommodate the arrival of more and more and more and more artifacts.
What's stored here, exactly?
This and that.
Bric-a-brac.
Some things along the lines of... last night's rock and roll.
I'm talking about the blood stone.
Both hands... on the bar, please.
I think I'll survive a crash.
No, that's not a safety bar.
It's a conduit.
You and Pete are the power source.
Your combined electrical energy makes this thing move.
It's fine, it's fine.
Look, Thomas Edison built this automobile for Henry Ford as a proof of concept, and it's perfectly safe.
Trust me.
Put your hands on the bar.
Put your hands on the bar.
Thank you.
We need both of you.
Hands on the bar, Myka.
Thank you.
Edison, he wanted Ford to let go of oil, but Ford, no, no, he stuck with it because it ruined his engines faster.
People had to keep buying them.
- What is that?
- What?
That is training flight 22.
We pulled that from the Bermuda Triangle.
The Triangle's been trying to pull it back ever since.
Duck and cover.
It's harmless.
The inventory kicks up a little static from time to time.
Why are you grinning?
Well, don't you think this stuff is kind of cool?
I mean...
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He'll be back.
- Hello?
- We should stick together.
Right this way, please.
Many of the items in here, kind of like the blood stone, Pete, that you wrestled with last night, the channel of tangential energy...
Well, tangential energy is kind of like the energy that forced the museum employee, last night, into... well, into almost committing murder.
- So how does that happen?
- {\Yeah, you know, }We're not really exactly sure how.
It goes back to Einstein, and E equals...
Yeah, okay.
Somehow... the matter that is in here has just enough energy to move other matter.
You know, like you.
- Move me where?
- Into trouble.
Bunk.
Is gravity bunk?
Magnetism?
{\You know, }These are mysterious forces that we live with{\ every day}, but we can't explain 'em.
{\I mean, }Can you even explain to me how a radio works?
And you don't {\really }care, as long as you get the traffic report{\, right?
}.
But if a radio landed in the hands of Thomas Jefferson, you know what Jefferson would do?
He would just lock it up until he figured out it wasn't gonna kill him.
And that is exactly... what we do here.
We take the unexplained... and we just safely tuck it away in this super-sized Pandora's box.
- Metaphorically speaking.
- {\Well, actually, }Pandora's box is over in aisle 989B.
Empty, of course.
Do the world a favor and clear your mind.
Well, that should be easy.
How did that get there?
'Cause I didn't pick that thing up.
It still amazes me how that thing moves.
{\What?
}What?
What is it?
Don't talk, don't hope, don't wish for anything.
- That kettle grants wishes?
- Yes.
Now Pete, look at me.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Open it.
Pete!
Pete, this...
This is a neutralizer.
You can think of this as a fire extinguisher for objects that act up.
Now look, I want you to come over here and {\I want you to}drop that {\very }slowly, right in here.
{ ow listen, }There are items around here, if you were to put it in there, they would generate a {\*big }flash, but this {\little thing }will {\probably just }be a little spark.
But you may flinch, and I don't want {\you }to, 'cause you could drop it, okay?
- Well, I have a wish.
- Don't!
- You wished for a ferret?
- No.
- That was already in the thing.
- I don't think so.
You wished for a transfer, didn't you?
Impossible wishes, wishes that can never be granted, they produce a ferret.
Don't ask me why.
My first year here, the whole place was crawling with ferrets.
- I swear, I didn't pick that thing up.
- No, I know, I know.
Not everybody is affected by everything.
Here, okay?
You have to be metaphysically predisposed.
And the external energies, they have to be in alignment.
- This is just a convergence thing.
- Right, sure, okay.
So we're...
we're all converged here, but I still have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
What you're supposed to do is hunt down whatever is threatening to ruin the world's day, {\and }neutralize it and bring it here.
You gotta snag it and bag it and tag it.
This is crazy!
This is crazy!
{\Well, y}You know, I don't...
It could be, you know, crazy fun.
{\Well, t}That's {\exactly }the attitude that brought you to our attention.
Do you guys want a cookie for the road?
What road?
There's rooms for you at Leena's Bed and Breakfast.
It's about 7 miles down the road that way, and I'll join you there in the morning and I'll tou...
{\well, }I'll just join you there in the morning.
Stay close!
Seriously, Lattimer, there's been a serious screw-up.
I'm serious.
And now you have a ferret.
What?
This town...
Is this a town or what?
- What's the name of it?
- Well, it's more like a street.
So it says here to turn left at Buffalo Station.
What?
No, no, no.
It's "Buffalo Statue".
Well, your penmanship is atrocious.
I don't need wise...
You know, that's...
You know, don't do that.
Can you finish a sentence?
A full thought?
Would you really like me to?
Wait.
No, no, no.
Don't... don't call Dickinson.
- He hates being pestered.
- I don't pester.
{\Well, w}When he knows something, he'll call.
Clearly the phrase "rolling with the punches"
is not in your vocabulary, so may I make a suggestion?
What might that be?
Unbunch your panties... and make the best of a bad situation.
And how do I do that?
Which part?
You're a freak.
Hello.
I'm Leena.
You must be Pete and Myka.
Come in.
I've got your rooms ready.
We serve three meals, 9:00, noon, and 5:00.
We've got radios in the rooms.
No tvs.
No in-room phones, but there is one there at the bottom of the stairs in the hallway.
You may choose any room.
Is there anywhere I can get a drink?
I mean, a drink... drink?
- What would you like?
- Whiskey neat.
- I can do that.
- Please do that.
She hates traveling.
She loves traveling.
It's the places she's traveled to that's the problem.
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm fine.
Just...
- Is everything okay?
- You're a lucky man, Pete.
I am?
You're in tune.
Very rare.
I don't know what that mea...
Look... are you... are you connected to Artie?
Let me know if your bed is big enough for you.
Hey, buddy.
- How'd it go today?
- Not bad.
{\pos(192,230}Lattimer seems interested.
{\pos(192,230}And Ms. Bering, not so much.
{\pos(192,230}Did you select a case for them?
{\Yeah, Listen. }I don't mean any disrespect, but are we really sure {\that these are }they're {\the people, }the right people?
Because...
I'm fully aware of their baggage.
Now what's the real problem?
Artie, take yourself off the hook.
Their fate falls on me.
You say that...
Dickinson wants them back.
You've got to get them locked in.
Can't sleep?
Yeah.
Me neither.
We don't have to talk.
So...
- Do you always eat when {\you're}stressed?
- Do you always talk this much?
You know, no light from the city to get in the way.
Nothing but sky.
This time of the year, we get Leo,
Cygnus, Sagittarius.
You know this how?
My dad and I used to camp a lot.
Where is he now?
Sorry.
What about your folks?
Colorado Springs.
They own a bookstore called Bering and Sons.
- How many brothers?
- No brothers.
Just me.
My dad thought the "and Sons" sounded classier.
{\Well, h}He must be proud of you.
Mom is.
Well, did protecting the president of the United States turn him around?
This won't.
From Denver to DC to a warehouse security guard in six months.
Now there's a career trajectory.
Look, about Denver,
I didn't mean to spit on that last night.
What you did there was better than textbook.
We're not discussing that.
Ever.
All right, well, I'm gonna... go back upstairs... and not sleep some more.
Earlier, did you hear a...
Hear what?
Never mind.
Dickinson will call.
He better.
Rotation, time,
Seever City.
Come on.
So it's gonna be you, then.
Cody Thomas, a law school grad student, at the university of Southern Iowa.
- Iowa?
- Yeah, Iowa.
His parents were killed in a plane crash.
He is a really good kid{\.
He's been }, putting himself through college with the settlement.
Why are we going to Iowa?
To find whatever it is that pushed this kid over the edge.
- What edge?
- He struck his girlfriend.
That's it?
So far.
For the past five days, I have been reviewing 11 possible cases, looking for whatever doesn't fit, something out of place, like blood on a marble floor that leads to a man with a knife.
Because of a rock that isn't just a rock.
I've got a hunch that this is the one.
What exactly are we looking for?
Well, you tell me.
It's bigger than a breadbox...
Or smaller.
If there is an artifact at the heart of this, then I've prepared a few questions for Cody that might reveal it.
Actually, it's more than a few questions, but...
"Do you have the constant feeling that today is yesterday?"
If they say yes, then we could...
They probably won't say yes.
It's unlikely.
- {\But }We could be dealing with time slip.
- Or a hangover.
Please take this seriously.
I had a run-in with a Mayan calendar {\a }few years ago, {\and }that question saved my life.
And the two agents that were with me were not quite so lucky.
What happened to them?
Their clocks...
Stopped.
So, what?
They died?
{\Well, }They'll wish they had in 100 years or so.
Anyway...
Neutralizer.
The purple stuff.
If you find the artifact, just drown it in there, like this, if you can.
And if it's too big, you just take this and throw it, and then call me.
And don't ask me how it works, because I have no idea.
And it doesn't always work.
And don't ingest that stuff, because you'll... see things.
And we'll stay in contact with these.
I have one just like it.
- Two-way video communication?
- I call it a Farnsworth.
Named after Philo Farnsworth, who invented that in 1929, right after he invented the television.
Isn't that remarkable?
I mean, anyway, if you wanna talk to me, just press that button.
What is that?
Nicola Tesla,
Thomas Edison's chief rival or nemesis, depending, he cooked this up as an alternative to bullets.
It's a...
It's really... a kind of electric stun gun{\, really}.
A polyphase ass-kicker.
Now, that's...
Just here.
Just don't put it past two to begin with.
That's the trigger, right there.
You should practice with it first.
One blast and down you go.
Don't point that at me.
Keep your finger away{\ from the trigger}.
Just don't.
Give him the gun.
And also, it zaps short-term memory, which is why agent Morris doesn't remember seeing me at the museum.
And that's it.
That's what?
Go to Iowa.
Talk to Cody.
Find the artifact, if it exists.
Neutralize it and bring it back.
Don't get killed.
- How's her aura?
- Tortured.
Guilt and grief, mostly.
She has a soft spot for the ferret{\, though}.
Just like you.
Now that was a long time ago.
You haven't changed that much.
She had a stowaway.
I found this in her room.
Oh, Lord, that's Houdini's wallet.
Fingers!
That was a bad spike.
That landed on something with her.
I requisitioned mesh screens for those shelves ten years ago.
And every year since.
- I've told you this.
- A few times.
You'd think Mrs. Frederic could maybe get that done.
Don't look at me.
Well, I had the FBI in here a while ago on a suspected terrorist thing.
All egos out to here and all looking like they're wearing daddy's suit.
Well, we feel the same way.
{\Well, just }Let me know if the thing's going federal so I can {\get }prepare my staff for the media.
It's not going federal.
We just have a few questions and then we're gone.
It's Dickinson.
- {\We'll }Just {\be }a sec.
- Yeah, this is Bering.
- How you doing?
- {\Well, }We're in Iowa now, on assignment.
- Any luck in getting us back?
- The bad news is not so far.
The good news is, I've got a line on this Frederic woman.
She worked for the Treasury Department in the 1950s, and after{\ that}...
Well, it's not the same woman.
The woman we met was younger.
I've got a Frederic in charge of some sort of secret sandbox.
{\It's being }Funded from a black ops budget I'm still trying to source.
{\Well, }I can fill you in.
These lines aren't secure.
Listen to me.
I'm doing everything I can to get you and Pete back here.
48 hours, tops.
So just follow your current orders and keep your head down.
Wait, sir!
Sir?
So how'd he sound?
48 hours.
- Yeah, but how'd he sound?
- Not good.
- What kind of questions?
- {\Well, }They're sort of diagnostic.
Diagnostic. {\What, }Like I'm sick?
You're Secret Service doctors?
Question number one.
"Have you recently encountered something that you feel has affected your life?"
Something like{\ what?
}...
An object of some kind.
Do handcuffs count?
Question number two. "While looking up, do you have the sensation of falling?"
I don't feel like I'm falling.
- Next question.
- Okay, question number three.
"Have you recently smelled something that could best be described
- "as fudge when there is no fudge?"
- Fudge?
Is that...
Question four.
"Do you have ever feel like this might be a colossal waste of time?"
Okay, so...
We're done with those questions...
What do you think happened with your girlfriend?
- What's her name?
- I don't know.
Emily.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
I was in class, talking to the professor about some mock trial thing.
{\Then }I woke up here, and they told me I beat Emily up.
- Have they let you see a doctor?
- Yeah.
- Says I'm fine.
- And no...
- No alcohol or drugs?
- No, I swear.
No history of blackouts?
This isn't me.
I would never hurt Emily.
This isn't me.
This isn't...
Se li uomini sapessino le cagioni della paura mia, capir potrebbero il mio dolor.
Get him out of here!
Let's get him down to secure lockup.
Well, that was scary.
{\pos(192,230)}Can you come this way, son?
{\pos(192,230)}Hello.
I'm Lorna Soliday.
I'm Cody's lawyer.
And did Travis call you?
Sheriff Travis respects the law, and he doesn't like being railroaded by federal agents.
Are you that hands-on with all your clients?
- Just my godson.
- So you knew his parents.
Very well.
And neither Cody nor I will be answering any more questions
- until I know what this is about.
- We're interested in Cody's behavior.
- His violent behavior.
- As in, where's it coming from?
What is this?
Someone pegged him as a threat to the President?
Not yet.
Not ever.
That's not Cody.
{\Well, }It was Cody that just destroyed that table{\ in there}.
Not to mention what he did to his girlfriend.
Does the secret service investigate every case
- of battery among college students?
- Nope.
Just this one.
- So where'd the Italian come in?
- What do you mean?
He spoke Italian in there, just before he decided
- that the interview was over.
- I don't know anything about that.
Well, has Cody come into contact with anything unusual, say, in the past few days?
- Yes.
You two.
- That was a serious question.
That was a serious answer.
Any more questions, Sheriff Travis has my number.
You felt that, right?
I'm not sure what you mean.
It got hot.
But you knew to get me to the floor before he freaked out.
The vibe.
Right.
Okay, so how do those things work?
Is there false alarms or...
- It happens all the time.
- So why do you trust them?
One time I didn't, and I should have.
You're right.
It's Italian, sort of.
I mean, this is either part gibberish.
I don't know.
It's some kind of code, maybe.
And my software can barely translate any of this and says "dolor"
means "pain."
And a text search came up with nothing.
There's no films, no books, no plays, no songs, no poems.
So what now?
You're right beside a college campus.
You can go find somebody who speaks Italian.
Excuse me.
Professor Marzotto?
We're with the secret service.
Oh, my.
It's an old construction.
15th century.
It's not working-class Italian either.
This is high brow.
- So what's he saying?
- Roughly?
"If people knew
"the reasons for my fear,
"they'd be able to understand my pain."
Do you visit Italy a lot?
I haven't been back in nearly two years.
But you're sure this translation is correct.
I'm a Renaissance scholar.
I'm sure.
One last question.
Do you know a student here named Cody Thomas?
I know of him.
I read about him in the paper.
It's a sad story{\, that}.
- How so?
- Well, you know.
He was a good kid, from what I heard.
And he had some sort of a breakdown.
All right, well, if we need you to translate anything else...
I'd be more than happy to help.
You can reach me at that number.
Great.
Thank you.
He's hiding something.
Did you see his neck pulse?
Don't you have a scrupulous eye for detail.
- He shelves his books alphabetically.
- I didn't notice that.
And he puts pens in one cup, pencils in another.
Now you're scaring me.
Did you see where he put his pen right before we left?
Was Sherlock Holmes a big deal at your parents' bookstore?
- Something got Marzotto going.
- And you.
I don't like being lied to.
I'll remember that. {\So, what?
}Do you want to go back and hit him again?
No, I want a hard phone line.
I thought this was a colossal waste of time.
Not anymore.
Hold up.
- Do you always walk so fast?
- Yes, I do.
Are you coming?
I have an incoming code Madrid for Minnie Harris.
Reply 6955.
- Hi, Minnie.
- Hey, hotshot.
- How's the White House?
- You know, it's a lot smaller than it looks on TV.
How are you?
- Chad and I are dating.
- Very nice.
Yes, it is.
- Look, I need some information.
- Okay, shoot.
Edward Marzotto, one "z" two "t"s.
- Professor at Southern Iowa University.
- Turnaround?
I need it now.
Sorry, I know this is big.
It's not a problem.
{\You can }Hang on and I'll give you the highlights?
- For sure.
- Thanks.
Hang on.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Government agents are asking me lots of questions I can't answer without getting you and me into a lot of trouble.
It's about the book.
Your boyfriend is quoting from it.
How's Myka?
Edgy, irritable.
You know, Myka.
- Why?
- Just checking.
Listen, there's something I forgot to mention before.
- What?
- Just before Cody got physical, there was some kind of a...
I don't know, a heat wave.
It just rolled right off of him.
This happen after a question?
No, he was talking about his girlfriend, Emily Krueger.
- You talked to her, right?
- No, not yet.
All right.
Listen,
I'm gonna check out that heat thing, and {\I'm gonna }see if that relates to anything.
And... meanwhile, what was that translation?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
Do you want me to...
Do you want me to run that again?
I got it.
You're positive that's the translation?
Absolutely positive?
Yeah, I mean, that's what Marzotto said.
- I'll call you back.
- Okay.
Got some good stuff.
Edward Melville Marzotto.
- Melville?
- Yeah, I know.
Anyway, the man loves his Italian art.
He just got back from Italy eight weeks ago, and the cops think...
Hey, bunny.
- Slow down.
- Walk faster.
So what'd you find out?
What happened in there?
Tell me.
I heard a...
I thought I heard... a voice over the phone that I really should not be hearing.
Same thing you heard at Leena's.
Look, sometimes we...
We hear things
- and see things that aren't there.
- What I heard can't be there.
- It can't be.
- Then it's not.
I mean, maybe it's post-traumatic stress.
I read the press release of what went down in Denver.
- Lives were saved.
- Lives were lost.
You're a hero.
You're gonna put me on a psych eval, aren't you?
Why would I do that?
Because you need to be able to depend on your partner.
All right, well, then you're just gonna have to depend on me to know that you're okay.
We're gonna finish this case, we're gonna get out of here.
We will.
I don't know if I can.
I don't even know what we're looking for.
Yes, you do.
I mean, whatever doesn't fit.
You know, something that's out of place.
Marzotto lied to us.
He said that the last time
- he was in Italy was...
- Two years ago.
Yeah, my contact told me it was eight weeks ago.
How'bout that?
I wonder what else he lied about.
- I guess we need more information.
- Yes, we do.
- Cody's girlfriend.
- Emily Krueger.
I need a picture!
{\pos(192,240)}Just give me a picture.
{\pos(192,240)}Give me a picture.
{\pos(192,230)}Don't make me come down there!
All right.
I know this is... awkward.
And I feel terrible, but...
You can't keep it.
I don't know what I was thinking even taking it out of Italy, but it has to go back.
I'm going to Rome next week.
And that's coming with me.
What's that for?
I hate this part.
- Emily, you're late.
- Sorry.
We were setting up for the party.
Can I help you?
Emily Krueger?
I know your pain, trust me.
We saw you leaving professor Marzotto's office, didn't we?
Oh, right.
I was there for a meeting.
For the play.
I'm in it.
Marzotto's sort of a technical advisor.
Does he know about your relationship with Cody?
He knows what happened.
Why?
Because when we talked to him about Cody, he didn't mention you.
Or that you'd just been to see him.
Maybe he was trying to protect my privacy.
- Why did you guys mention Cody?
- We needed something translated.
Yeah, have you ever heard Cody speak Italian?
Just once, when he did this.
- How long have you known Cody?
- Since the eighth grade.
Got serious after his parents died.
I came here for theater.
He applied for law school.
His godmother helped him get in.
- Lorna Soliday?
- You met her?
- Does she have any family?
- Just Cody.
And that's not even real family.
She made sure that he got that big settlement when his parents died.
Do you know what it means?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Only that he's afraid of abandonment.
It scares him.
Maybe he thought that I was spending too much time on the play.
I don't know.
Can I go back to work now?
Ten to one this has nothing to do with the hocus pocus Artie's pushing.
{\pos(192,230)}How'bout a billion to one?
How about a cute girl
{\pos(192,230)}in a play by Machiavelli makes her insecure boyfriend freak out?
{\pos(192,230)}Or... or try this.
Emily, an actress, is a ruthless gold digger.
{\pos(192,230)}She'd know which buttons to push on her insecure boyfriend
{\pos(200,230)}to get him made enough to hit her.{\Right?
} She goes for the money.
{\pos(192,220)}Sues him for it.
{\pos(192,230)}What kind of women do you date?
- It's Marzotto.
- What?
The attendant said he heard him speaking Italian before he doused himself.
Hold on.
Why'd you talk to marzotto?
Who told you that?
Secret service hits campus, and people notice.
And now he's dead.
Before this, you said something to make Cody{\ Thomas} want to knock your heads off.
- {\Is there }Something you want to tell me?
- We should talk{\ about this} later.
- Let me tell you something...
- Sure.
{\Tell me }Something that makes it seem like I couldn't kick your ass in front of your men.
Boys, can we put our badges back in our pants, please?
Sheriff.
What was that?
- We gotta get to Marzotto's office.
- And how are we gonna get in?
Hotshot.
What the hell is Warehouse 13?
We haven't met.
I'm Mrs. Frederic.
- How'd you get in here?
- Through a door.
Warehouse 13, is it yours?
It's mine.
And so are Lattimer and Bering.
Excuse me?
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
Never mind.
The vibe thing?
My dad was a... fireman.
When I was 12,
I got this feeling one morning that I was never gonna see him again.
And you didn't say anything?
I didn't want him to see how scared I was.
He died that night in a house fire, saving a couple of kids.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
So now when you get a feeling...
- He got his pen out of his pencil cup.
- At least he died happy.
That's not funny.
You're right.
That's strange.
What?
The "m"s are out of order.
There's something in there.
- Is this it?
- I don't know.
- Well, what if it is?
- Then we're done.
- So open it.
- You open it.
I don't want another ferret or whatever.
- Se li uomini...
- Don't.
Just in case.
- What's that?
- Something's missing.
Let's call Artie.
Miss Soliday.
- What are you doing here?
- You heard what happened to Marzotto?
Yes, Sheriff Travis just called.
Now get out before I call him back and tell him you're searching this office without a warrant.
We're here investigating his suicide.
Ed didn't kill himself.
- He had help.
- What do you mean?
Somebody broke his heart.
We were together for three years.
And then we weren't.
I thought we were in love, but things change, and he chose someone else.
A student?
Did Emily Krueger break his heart?
And Cody's.
She's a despicable young woman who uses people to get what she wants, and then when she's done using them...
We're looking for something, something about this big.
We think Marzotto had it, but now it's missing.
Did Emily get it, you know, whatever it is?
Why don't you ask her?
She's helping with the party for the play.
Cody's there.
- Cody's out?
- Emily dropped the charges.
- Okay, we should go.
- I'm coming with you.
If you're confronting Emily, I need to be there for Cody.
Let's go.
I gotta lose weight.
Do you think Emily would ever hurt Cody?
Not physically.
Even if she tried, she couldn't.
And why not?
Me.
Cody has me.
I made a promise to his parents when I became his godmother that I would always be there to protect him.
It's only a matter of time before Cody realizes
Emily's just small-town trash.
Cody is destined for great things, and I'm helping him succeed.
With me, he can do anything or be anyone he wants.
Could you pull over for a sec?
I know you.
Well, that's a good sign.
Where am I?
Hospital.
In Iowa.
Seever City.
What happened?
Car accident.
You've been out for two days.
How's Pete?
Lattimer's still unconscious.
We don't know.
There's someone here to see you.
Someone who's gonna help you get back to where you belong.
The President?
Better.
Hey, bunny.
Hey.
You know you shouldn't be here, right?
I could say the same thing about you.
I think you just did.
I'm hurt.
That didn't stop you in Denver.
- I was late.
- No, bunny.
I was early.
I jumped the gun.
You're dead, Sam.
You need to get up now.
You got a lot of things you need to do.
Get up.
You have to get up now.
Get up.
Wake up, buddy.
Can you hear me?
Come on.
Here we go.
All right.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?
What?
What?
- You're giving me a wedgie.
- What?
Just... you okay?
Sit here and don't move.
I'm just gonna get the book.
If you find a badge, it's mine.
Never mind.
I found it.
You okay?
Soliday crashed the car.
You think?
Where is she?
She's not here.
She had... some kind of jewelry in her hair, like a comb thing.
It looked old, like it would fit in the book.
- Pete, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Just... here, answer that.
You're looking for jewelry.
This, this thing.
Yeah, we know.
We just saw it in a woman's hair.
- She tried to kill us.
- A woman?
What woman?
Her name is Lorna Soliday.
She's...
Part of the ruling class, single, successful{\.
She's}, middle-aged.
She's a survivor of family tragedies and the death of loved ones.
{\And s}She's connected somehow to a young man, {\a young man }that she believes needs her protection?
He's good, yeah.
What's the matter with you two?
{\Are you two all right?
}
Okay, anyway, look.
This comb is transmitting Lucretia Borgia.
- Lucretia who?
- Borgia.
She's a cutthroat Italian who ruled Italy in the 1600s with her father and brothers.
My family owned a book store, remember?
That's right.
So what do you mean the comb's transmitting?
An alchemist made it, okay?
Out of what, I don't know.
It's supposed to be some kind of Renaissance roofie.
Somehow the crystals in the ionized metal {\in this thing }are affecting brain chemistry.
- What about the phrase?
- Yeah, the phrase.
That's like some kind of phonetic trigger.
This is a very, very, very unhappy woman.
Very unlucky in love.
- There's supposed to be a jewelry box.
- We found it in Marzotto's office.
He must have given Soliday the comb.
Like her, she wants love at any cost.
She wants love, and she is gonna kill to get it.
She wants...
She wants Cody, so she wants Emily gone.
And Emily's at the party.
What are you talking about a party?
{\Party?
}What party?
God.
Some renaissance blowout for some Machiavelli play.
Machia...
This woman's gonna be there?
You've gotta stop this woman.
Lucretia Borgia, 600 years ago, started a bloody reign of terror, and this comb is gonna wanna start it all over again.
It's got twisted desires, and it'll amplify, it'll spread like some kind of orgiastic virus.
First to Iowa, then to Nebraska, then to Illinois.
We understand.
Probably first to Illinois and then...
Okay, look, we need to get you to a hospital first and...
No, look, I'm trained to take a bullet if necessary.
But...
I'm not sure how to stop a dead Italian cougar.
Weneedsomekindofapproach.
Well, I have no more color-coded plans.
There's a silver lining.
Okay, I'll go in, grab Cody.
- You flank.
- No, you flank.
Trust me.
That's not creepy.
How you doing?
That's nice.
Come on, man, you don't wanna do this.
Look.
You don't wanna hurt her.
Just let Emily go.
He intends to.
Her dying scream will be the trigger...
Look, nobody's screaming, okay?
We're gonna take a deep breath, and we're all gonna come back down to Earth.
Cute.
Kid's fast.
What's your pain, Lorna?
What are you afraid of?
You know.
And so does she.
Show's over.
Drop the comb... thing.
Did you really let your lover die?
- Shut up.
- For a chance at glory?
I said shut up.
Don't look at it, Myka.
Yeah, sorry.
No one's dying here tonight.
But you might lose a tooth.
Duck and cover?
- What did I do?
- It's okay.
It's over.
Love hurts, I know.
So here's the deal.
You got a choice.
You can come back to DC.
Or you can stay with the new assignment.
- What's the catch?
- I only get you.
Lattimer has to stay there.
- And if I stay, what happens to Pete?
- He still stays.
- How long do I have to think about it?
- About five more seconds.
Four, three, two.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Now, in addition to all the museums and art galleries and other great stuff here in our nation's capital, there's one thing you're gonna love probably more than anything else.
The dinosaurs.
(KIDS CHEERING)
This way.
Stick together.
(CLEARING THROAT)
Agent Bering?
Hi, Chet Greenfield.
Hello.
Sorry I'm late.
No problem.
My assistant said you double checked everything yesterday.
I did, but I'd like to run a full review before we lock it down.
Sure.
With you.
Me?
You're the boss.
I'd like to avoid any chain-of-command confusion.
I tell you, and it gets done.
Shall we start in the main hall?
Well, I understand, but I'm pretty booked up at the moment.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
I'll clear my schedule.
I'd appreciate it.
PETE:
Morning, Kacey.
I just figured out who you are.
You're a fireman.
Mmm-hmm.
No?
Come on.
You know absolutely everything about me.
Well, that's because you talk a lot.
Gordon, this is Agent Bering, with the Secret Service.
Gordon Letanik?
And what's this?
An Aztec blood stone.
The boss of virgin sacrifices.
Handsome devil.
I'm just cleaning him for the reception tonight.
CHET:
Agent Bering wants the Group D artifacts moved to the west wall.
They're blocking an exit.
Lose Tuvalu and Malta, move Britain to the back.
If it still doesn't fit, see me and we'll cut something else.
Yes, sir.
I'll just finish up.
CHET:
What's next?
The main floor bathrooms.
I'll need the plumbing pulled again.
Ow!
I would try to sneak you in, but the Secret Service will be there and they can be jerks.
So I've heard.
Call you soon.
You promise?
Promise.
Bye now.
Bye.
Champagne?
Thank you.
Champagne?
Status check on Eagle.
(SOFT GROWLING)
Who's on Emerald entrance?
Me, Morris.
Why aren't you at Emerald?
Well, because I'm here.
How's home base?
We're calling home base "Magenta."
(CHUCKLES) Well, I'm not.
You changed the protocol.
I tweaked it.
I wrote it.
And I didn't use colors.
Why weren't you at my briefing?
I was vetting one of the servers.
Screwing off is more like it.
Well, you say potato.
Get back to Emerald.
You're not my superior.
Dickinson gave this to me.
I'm running it.
Meeka.
Myka.
Myka.
Myka.
Myka.
Mmm-hmm.
I get vibes.
Sorry?
This isn't some run and gun that you're used to in Denver.
Get to the point, Lattimer.
Dickinson gave you this shindig with my protocol because my specialty is logistics, framing.
And I kid you not, there is something really off in here.
AGENT:
Eagle at Magenta.
Mr. President, wait a moment, please.
This is Bering, Eagle is free to enter.
Negative, negative.
This is Lattimer.
Hold Eagle at five until further.
Copy?
AGENT:
Copy that.
Holding Eagle.
Get back to Emerald.
Look, Myka, why don't you pull your head out of your "Magenta" and feel the room?
Something's off.
Listen, Showboat.
Nothing's off.
The room is fine.
Everything is fine.
Now take your vibe and go.
Enjoy your party.
I will.
I want a perimeter check ASAP.
(SOFT GROWLING)
Emerald clear.
AGENT 1:
Peach clear.
AGENT 2:
Orange clear.
AGENT 3:
Gold clear.
AGENT 4:
Crimson clear.
(BUZZING)
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Blood.
Pete?
What are you doing here?
Working.
(GASPS) Is there a fire?
Mmm-mmm.
Excuse me, sir.
Wait just a second.
Secret Service.
This is...
Gotta go.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
That's an okay for Eagle to enter.
AGENT:
Affirmative.
(PATRIOTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
Clear Eagle.
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
Freeze!
Drop the knife.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Hold your fire!
Seriously, Gordon, drop the knife.
Drop that.
Whatever it is.
Can't do that, Pete.
Weapon.
We're done here.
Hey!
(SCREAMING)
(SIGHING)
Tell me you found the guy.
The guy you said stole the rock?
We're gonna need a sample.
Come on, Dickinson.
Well, you said, among many strange things, that the rock was bleeding.
It was.
Taxpayers will probably wanna know if you were high, paranoid, or just part of an Aztec art theft ring.
In the meantime, you're suspended, with pay, for two weeks till we get this thing worked out.
What about Morris?
He says nothing happened at Emerald.
Okay, can we stop with the colors already?
(SIGHING) What about the guy with the knife?
What?
Letanik?
Yes.
He's in a coma.
Docs don't know why or how long that's gonna last.
And Bering?
Myka's being thanked personally by the President and the First Lady.
Of course she is.
She's going places.
You, on the other hand, you're going to the bathroom.
That's funny.
Ha, ha.
(FLOORBOARD CREAKS)
Mr. Lattimer.
My name's Frederic.
Frederic what?
Mrs. Frederic.
Well, that's a relief.
I'm with the government.
I'm here on a matter of national security.
What's that?
An invitation to endless wonder.
Okay, could you sound a little more creepy?
Read it.
Please note the action code.
It is legitimate.
You're part of my bailiwick now.
Your bailiwick?
You're working for me.
For you?
Am I stuttering?
No, ma'am.
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, okay.
Okay.
All right, I get it.
I get it.
This is a joke, right?
Dickinson put you guys up.
This is Dickinson being funny, right?
Do I look like a joke, Mr. Lattimer?
No.
You're to be in South Dakota at those coordinates, at noon tomorrow.
You will mention our meeting and your pending assignment to no one.
Is that understood?
How long am I gonna be in South Dakota?
Indefinitely.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, look.
I've got a life here.
Really?
Yeah.
I've got
things.
Pack light, Mr. Lattimer.
We'll ship what you need and store the rest.
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Prepare to turn right in 100 feet.
Turn right now.
(BRAKES SQUEALING)
You have missed your turn.
Go back.
Stop.
Turn right.
Destination straight ahead.
You've got to be kidding me.
(COW MOOING)
PETE:
Yeah.
Endless wonder.
Hello!
It's Agent Lattimer.
I'm here!
Hello!
(WHOOSHING)
Oh, great.
(COW MOOING)
I heard you were suspended.
Yeah, I heard that, too.
Why are you here?
I was ordered here last night.
Mrs. Frederic.
Yes.
Yeah.
Said it was a matter of national security.
National security.
Right.
(DOOR OPENING)
(BIRD CALLING)
How are you guys doing?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to fix the fish.
(EXCLAIMING) Hey, stop right there.
What are you doing?
This is the guy.
The one from last night.
The guy who stole the rock.
You stole the rock.
It's a blood stone.
It's safe.
It's inside the building.
Yeah, well, it's the property of the museum.
ARTIE:
And that museum is property of the U. S. Government.
And so is the Warehouse.
And so am I.
Secret Service.
I also work for Mrs. Frederic.
Arthur Nielsen.
You can call me Artie.
Got some ID?
No.
We take the Secret part seriously around here.
Oh, I just wanted to thank you for your assistance in last night's retrieval.
That was very good.
Hey, did you throw that football at me?
You weren't here when I threw it.
It takes a while to circle back.
Come on inside.
I'll show you around.
Around what?
What am I doing here?
I'll explain everything inside.
Come on.
I made cookies.
Ooh!
Yeah, come on.
Come on.
Really, it's okay.
Go inside.
Don't go far!
Okay, come on in.
Wait for me at the bottom of the stairs.
Go, go, go.
It's fine.
Don't touch anything.
ARTIE:
Don't touch the bombs.
Hold this.
Hold it.
Come on.
It's okay.
(BEEPING)
ARTIE:
Right this way.
Miss Bering, Mr. Lattimer, welcome to Warehouse 13.
I'm thrilled you're on the team.
What team?
What is this place?
Officially, K39ZZZ, on the North American grid.
But I like to think of it as America's attic.
Pete, close the door.
Tell me exactly what I'm doing here.
Exactly?
That's a little...
Yeah.
Well, to put it plainly, you're both joining me as fellow gatherers and protectors of secrets.
Put it plainer.
(STAMMERING) This warehouse...
Look, the Warehouse needs you.
Pete, don't touch.
It needs your combined talents.
I mean, he's intuitive, and you've got a scrupulous eye for detail.
He's scattershot, see?
You're meticulous.
You look, he leaps.
There's been a mistake.
I'm too valuable to be wasted here.
No offense.
Of course not.
Can I use your phone, please?
Mine?
It's broken.
Well, I have to make a phone call, so...
There's no signal here.
(SIGHS)
Just pull the door, and you'll be...
Now.
There you go.
(DOOR CLOSES)
I think she had other plans.
(SIGHING) So did I.
(SIGHS)
You want juice or are you a milk person?
(SIGHING) You know what I'd really like?
Oh, I do indeed, but falling off the wagon may not be the best option at this point.
Milk it is.
Yeah.
PETE:
That's Mrs. Frederic.
ARTIE:
Long time ago.
She looks exactly the same.
Odd, isn't it?
You don't want a cookie?
Yeah.
Okay, so who are these guys?
Former colleagues.
And where are they now?
Well, this one and this one are dead.
This one, a mental institution in Germany.
And this last one, disappeared.
One day I'll find him.
Ted, these are two of my best agents.
How can you not know?
I'm looking at the order.
You processed it.
How can you not know?
(PHONE BEEPS)
Hold on.
Dickinson.
Sir, it's Myka Bering.
Myka.
Sir, I have a little situation here.
I'm not sure...
Yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I'm looking at the transfer order right now.
The name on here is Frederic.
You're transferred to where?
Where are you?
Well, I'm in South Dakota.
Where?
South Dakota.
What are you doing in South Dakota?
You don't know about this?
No.
Who is Frederic?
(STATIC CRACKLING)
Sir?
Sir?
Myka?
Myka?
Who's this Frederic?
Sir!
Yes, yes.
She handed me orders last night to come to a warehouse in South Dakota.
The order code was solid, and Lattimer's here, too.
Look, I'm requesting an immediate stand down and transfer back to D.C.
Myka.
Myka, I can't do that.
This order trumps me.
Hold on and I will get you back here ASAP.
What should I do?
Follow orders.
Those orders, both of you.
And how long will this take?
Sir?
Sir?
Are you there?
That's a pile of crap.
No kidding.
No, I'm not kidding.
You're actually standing in a big pile of cow manure.
(FLIES BUZZING)
Oatmeal Scotchie?
No, thank you.
I don't eat sugar.
Good for you.
Listen, please don't think of this assignment as some sort of punishment.
Can you hold this?
What?
Your presence here is not really a reaction to what happened to you in Denver.
So...
I got a commendation for what happened in Denver.
Yes, you did.
It's time for the nickel tour.
Come on.
The order trumps Dickinson?
ARTIE:
The first Warehouse 13 was built in '98.
So we're stuck.
Until he works out a transfer, yes.
1898.
We didn't have a handle on how to store stuff.
It burned down.
Some remodeling and excavations were necessary as the years went on to accommodate the arrival of more and more and more and more artifacts.
What's stored here exactly?
Oh, this and that, bric-a-brac.
Some things along the lines of last night's rock and roll.
I'm talking about the blood stone.
Both hands on the bar, please.
I think I'll survive a crash.
(BOTH SNICKERING)
No, that's not a safety bar, it's a conduit.
You and Pete are the power source.
Your combined electrical energy makes this thing move.
It's fine, it's fine.
Look, Thomas Edison built this automobile for Henry Ford as a proof of concept, and it's perfectly safe.
Trust me.
Put your hands on the bar.
Put your hands on the bar.
(SIGHS) Thank you.
We need both of you.
Hands on the bar, Myka.
Thank you.
Edison, he wanted Ford to let go of oil.
But Ford, no, no, he stuck with it because it ruined his engines faster.
People had to keep buying them.
PETE:
What is that?
ARTIE:
What?
Oh!
That is Training Flight 22.
We pulled that from the Bermuda Triangle.
The Triangle has been trying to pull it back ever since.
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
Duck and cover.
Ow.
ARTIE:
It's harmless.
Inventory kicks up a little static from time to time.
Why are you grinning?
Well, don't you think this stuff is kind of cool?
What?
Where is he?
I don't know.
He'll be back.
Artie!
Hello?
We should stick together.
Right this way, please.
Pete.
Many of the items in here, kind of like the blood stone,
Pete, that you wrestled with last night.
They channel a tangential energy, well...
Tangential energy is kind of like the energy that forced the museum employee last night into...
Well, into almost committing murder.
So how does that happen?
Yeah, we're not really exactly sure how.
It goes back to Einstein, or E equals...
Yeah, okay.
Somehow the matter that is in here has just enough energy to move other matter.
You know, like you.
Move me where?
Into trouble.
Bunk.
Is gravity bunk?
Magnetism?
These are mysterious forces, that we live with every day, but we can't explain them.
Can you even explain to me how a radio works?
Huh?
No.
And you don't really care, as long as you get the traffic report, right?
But if a radio landed in the hands of Thomas Jefferson, you know what Jefferson would do?
He would just lock it up.
Until he figured out it wasn't gonna kill him.
And that is exactly what we do here.
We take the unexplained
(CRASHING)
And we just safely tuck it away in this supersized Pandora's box.
Metaphorically speaking.
Well, actually, Pandora's box is over in aisle 989 B.
Empty, of course.
(BEEPS)
Pete, do the world a favor and clear your mind.
Well, that should be easy.
Whoa!
Wow.
How did that get there?
Because I didn't pick that thing up.
It still amazes me how that thing moves.
What?
What?
What is it?
Don't talk, don't hope, don't wish for anything.
That kettle grants wishes?
Yes.
Now, Pete, look at me.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Okay.
Open it.
Pete!
Pete.
This is a neutralizer.
You can think of this as a fire extinguisher for objects that "act up."
Now, look, I want you to come over here,
I want you to drop that very slowly, right in here.
Now, listen, there are items around here, if you were to put it in there, they would generate a big flash, but this little thing will probably be a little spark.
But you may flinch, and I don't want you to, 'cause you could drop it.
Okay?
Well, I have a wish.
Don't!
(GASPS)
You wished for a ferret?
No.
That was already in the thing.
I don't think so.
You wished for a transfer, didn't you?
Mmm.
Impossible wishes, wishes that can never be granted, they produce a ferret.
Don't ask me why.
My first year here, the whole place was crawling with ferrets.
I swear, I didn't pick that thing up.
No, I know, I know.
Not everybody is affected by everything.
Here, okay?
You have to be metaphysically predisposed.
And the external energies, they have to be in alignment.
This is just a convergence thing.
Right, sure, okay.
So we're all converged here, but I still have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
What you're supposed to do is hunt down whatever is threatening to ruin the world's day, neutralize it and bring it here.
You gotta snag it and bag it and tag it.
This is crazy!
This is crazy!
You know, I don't...
It could be, you know, crazy fun.
That's exactly the attitude that brought you to our attention.
Do you guys want a cookie for the road?
What road?
There's rooms for you at Leena's Bed Breakfast.
It's about seven miles down the road that way, and I'll join you there in the morning, and I'II...
I'll just join you there in the morning.
Stay close!
Seriously, Lattimer, there's been a serious screw-up.
I'm serious.
And now you have a ferret.
What?
MYKA:
This town, is this a town or what?
What's the name of it?
PETE:
Well, it's more like a street.
So it says here to turn left at Buffalo Station.
What?
No, no, no.
It's "Buffalo Statue."
It says "Buffalo Statue."
Well, your penmanship is atrocious.
I don't need wise...
You know, that's...
You know, don't do that.
Can you finish a sentence?
A full thought?
Would you really like me to?
Wait.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
No, no, no.
Don't call Dickinson.
He hates being pestered.
I don't pester.
Well, when he knows something, he'll call.
Clearly the phrase "rolling with the punches" is not in your vocabulary, so may I make a suggestion?
What might that be?
Unbunch your panties, and make the best of a bad situation.
And how do I do that?
Which part?
You're a freak.
Hello.
I'm Leena.
You must be Pete and Myka.
Come in.
I've got your rooms ready.
We serve three meals, 9:00, noon, and 5:00.
We've got radios in the rooms.
No TVs.
No in-room phones, but there is one there at the bottom of the stairs in the hallway.
You may choose any room.
Is there anywhere I can get a drink?
I mean, a drink drink?
What would you like?
Whiskey neat.
I can do that.
Please do that.
She hates traveling.
(FERRET CHITTERING)
She loves traveling.
It's the places she's traveled to that's the problem.
Ah.
Can I get you anything?
No, I'm fine.
Yep, yep.
(CLEARING THROAT)
Is everything okay?
You're a lucky man, Pete.
I am?
You're in tune.
Very rare.
I don't know what that...
Look, Leena, are you connected to Artie?
Let me know if your bed is big enough for you.
(SIGHING)
(CHITTERING)
(DIALING)
(CLATTERING)
(MUMBLING)
(GLASS SHATTERING)
(SIGHING)
SAM:
Hey, Bunny.
(FARNSWORTH RINGING)
How'd it go today?
Not bad.
Lattimer seems interested.
And Miss Bering, not so much.
Mmm.
Did you select a case for them?
Yeah.
Listen, I don't mean any disrespect, but are we really sure that these are the people?
The right people?
Because...
Artie.
I'm fully aware of their baggage.
Now, what's the real problem?
Artie, take yourself off the hook.
Their fate falls on me.
You say that...
Dickinson wants them back.
You've got to get them locked in.
Can't sleep?
Yeah.
Me neither.
We don't have to talk.
So...
Do you always eat when you're stressed?
Do you always talk this much?
You know, no light from the city to get in the way.
Nothing but sky.
This time of the year, we get Leo,
Cygnus, Sagittarius.
You know this how?
My dad and I used to camp a lot.
Where is he now?
(SIGHING)
Sorry.
What about your folks?
MYKA:
Colorado Springs.
They own a bookstore called Bering Sons.
How many brothers?
No brothers.
Just me.
My dad thought the "and Sons" sounded classier.
Well, he must be proud of you.
Mom is.
Well, did protecting the President of the United States turn him around?
Yeah.
This won't.
From Denver to D.C. To a warehouse security guard in six months.
Now, there's a career trajectory.
Look, about Denver,
I didn't mean to spit on that last night.
What you did there was better than textbook.
We're not discussing that.
Ever.
All right, well, I'm gonna go back upstairs and not sleep some more.
Hey.
Earlier, did you hear a...
Hear what?
(LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY)
Never mind.
Dickinson will call.
He better.
Location, time, Seever City.
Come on.
So it's gonna be you, then.
Okay, Cody Thomas, a law school grad student, University of Southern Iowa.
Iowa?
Yeah, Iowa.
His parents were killed in a plane crash.
He is a really good kid.
He's been putting himself through college with the settlement.
Why are we going to Iowa?
To find whatever it is that pushed this kid over the edge.
What edge?
He struck his girlfriend.
That's it?
So far.
Look, for the past five days, I have been reviewing 11 possible cases, looking for whatever doesn't fit.
Something out of place, like blood on a marble floor that leads to a man with a knife because of a rock that isn't just a rock.
I've got a hunch that this is the one.
What exactly are we looking for?
Well, you tell me.
It's bigger than a breadbox.
Or smaller.
If there is an artifact at the heart of this, then I've prepared a few questions for Cody that might reveal it.
Actually, it's more than a few questions, but...
"Do you have the constant feeling that today is yesterday?"
Okay, yeah.
See, if they say yes, then we could...
They probably won't say yes.
It's unlikely.
But we could be dealing with time slip.
Or a hangover.
(EXCLAIMS)
Please take this seriously.
I had a run-in with a Mayan calendar a few years ago, and that question saved my life, and the two agents that were with me were not quite so lucky.
What happened to them?
Their clocks stopped.
So, what?
They died?
Well, they'll wish they had in 100 years or so.
Anyway...
Neutralizer.
The purple stuff.
If you find the artifact, just drown it in there, like this, if you can.
And if it's too big, you just take this and throw it, and then call me.
And don't ask me how it works, because I have no idea.
And it doesn't always work.
And don't ingest that stuff, because you'II...
You'll see things.
And we'll stay in contact with these.
I have one just like it.
Two-way video communication?
ARTIE:
I call it a Farnsworth.
It's named after Philo Farnsworth, who invented that in 1929, right after he invented the television.
Isn't that remarkable?
I mean, anyway, if you want to talk to me, just press that button.
(PETE CHUCKLING)
What is that?
(CHUCKLING) Nikola Tesla,
Thomas Edison's chief rival or nemesis, depending...
He cooked this up as an alternative to bullets.
It's really a kind of electric stun gun.
It's a polyphase ass-kicker.
Now, that's...
Yeah.
Just here.
Just don't put it past two to begin with.
That's the trigger, right there.
You should practice with it first.
One blast and down you go.
Don't point that at me.
Keep your finger away.
Just don't.
MYKA:
Stop.
Give him the gun.
And also, it zaps short-term memory, which is why Agent Morris doesn't remember seeing me at the museum.
And that's it.
(CLEARS THROAT)
That's what?
Go to Iowa.
Talk to Cody.
Find the artifact if it exists.
Neutralize it, bring it back.
Oh, and don't get killed.
(SIGHS)
How's her aura?
Tortured.
Guilt and grief, mostly.
She has a soft spot for the ferret, though.
Just like you.
Now, that was a long time ago.
Hmm.
You haven't changed that much.
She had a stowaway.
I found this in her room.
Oh, Lord.
That's Houdini's wallet.
Fingers!
Okay.
That was a bad spike.
That landed on something with her.
I requisitioned mesh screens for those shelves ten years ago.
And every year since.
I've told you this.
A few times.
(SIGHING) You'd think Mrs. Frederic could maybe get that done.
Don't look at me.
TRAVIS:
Well, I had the FBI in here a while ago on a suspected terrorist thing.
All egos out to here and all looking like they're wearing daddy's suit.
Well, we feel the same way.
Ah, just let me know if this thing's going federal so I can get my staff prepared for the media.
It's not going federal.
We just have a few questions and then we're gone.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
It's Dickinson.
Oh.
It'll just be a sec.
Yeah, this is Bering.
DICKINSON:
Myka, how you doing?
Well, we're in Iowa now, on assignment.
Any luck in getting us back?
Bad news is, not so far.
Good news is, I've got a line on this Frederic woman.
She worked for the Treasury Department in the 1950s, after that...
Well, it's not the same woman.
The woman we met was younger.
I've got a Frederic in charge of some sort of secret sandbox.
It's being funded from a black ops budget I'm still trying to source.
Well, I can fill you in.
No, no, no.
These lines aren't secure.
Listen to me.
I'm doing everything I can to get you and Pete back here. 48 hours, tops.
So just follow your current orders and keep your head down.
Wait, sir!
Sir?
So, how'd he sound?
Forty-eight hours.
Yeah, but how'd he sound?
Not good.
What kind of questions?
They're sort of diagnostic.
Diagnostic.
What, like I'm sick?
You're Secret Service doctors?
No.
Question number one.
"Have you recently encountered something that you feel has affected your life?"
Something like what?
An object of some kind.
Do handcuffs count?
No.
Question number two.
"While looking up, do you have the sensation of falling?"
Cody?
No.
I don't feel like I'm falling.
Next question.
Okay, question number three.
"Have you recently smelled something that could best be described as
"fudge when there is no fudge?"
Fudge?
Is that...
Question four. "Do you ever feel like this might be a colossal waste of time?"
Okay, let's...
Yeah.
Okay.
We're done with those questions, Cody.
Yes.
PETE:
What do you think happened with your girlfriend?
What's her name?
I don't know.
Emily.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
I was in class, talking to the professor about some mock trial thing.
I woke up here, and they told me I beat Emily up.
They let you see a doctor?
Yeah.
Says I'm fine.
And no...
No alcohol or drugs?
No, I swear.
No history of blackouts?
No.
This isn't me.
I would never hurt Emily.
This isn't me.
This isn't...
Cody?
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Get him out of here!
OFFICER 1:
Right, let's go.
OFFICER 2:
We got him, sir.
Let's get him down to secure lockup.
Let's go.
(PANTING)
PETE:
Well, that was scary.
SOLIDAY: (QUIETLY) You don't need to worry about anything.
I'm gonna take care of it.
Just hang in there.
I'm gonna get you out of here soon.
OFFICER:
Can you come this way, son?
Hello.
I'm Lorna Soliday.
I'm Cody's lawyer.
And did Travis call you?
Sheriff Travis respects the law, and he doesn't like being railroaded by federal agents.
Are you that hands-on with all your clients?
No.
Just my godson.
So you knew his parents.
Very well.
And neither Cody nor I will be answering any more questions until I know what this is about.
We're interested in Cody's behavior.
His violent behavior.
As in, where's it coming from?
What is this?
Someone pegged him as a threat to the President?
Not yet.
Not ever.
That's not Cody.
It was Cody that just destroyed that table in there.
Not to mention what he did to his girlfriend.
Does the Secret Service investigate every case of battery among college students?
Nope.
Just this one.
So where'd the Italian come in?
What do you mean?
He spoke Italian in there, just before he decided that the interview was over.
I don't know anything about that.
Well, has Cody come into contact with anything unusual, say, in the past few days?
Yes.
You two.
That was a serious question.
That was a serious answer.
Any more questions, Sheriff Travis has my number.
You felt that, right?
I'm not sure what you mean.
It got hot.
Yeah.
But you knew to get me to the floor before he freaked out.
(SIGHS)
The vibe.
Right.
Okay, so how do those things work?
Is there false alarms or...
It happens all the time.
So why do you trust them?
Well...
One time I didn't, and I should have.
(FARNSWORTH RINGING)
You're right.
It's Italian, sort of.
(CODY SPEAKING ITALIAN)
I mean, this is either part gibberish.
I don't know.
It's some kind of code, maybe.
And my software can barely translate any of this.
I mean, "dolore" means "pain."
And a tech search came up with nothing.
There's no films, no books, no plays, no songs, no poems.
Okay, so what now?
Well, you're right beside a college campus.
You can go find somebody who speaks Italian.
(STUTTERING)
Artie.
Hello?
Hello?
Excuse me.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Professor Marzotto?
Yes.
We're with the Secret Service.
Oh, my.
(CODY SPEAKING ITALIAN)
It's an old construction.
15th century.
It's not working-class Italian either.
This is high brow.
PETE:
So what's he saying?
Roughly?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they'd be able to understand my pain."
Do you visit Italy a lot?
I haven't been back in nearly two years.
But you're sure this translation is correct.
I'm a Renaissance scholar.
I'm sure.
PETE:
Oh!
One last question.
Do you know a student here named Cody Thomas?
I know of him.
I read about him in the paper.
It's a sad story, that.
How so?
Well, you know.
He was a good kid.
From what I heard, he had some sort of a breakdown.
All right.
Well, if we need you to translate anything else...
I'd be more than happy to help.
You can reach me at that number.
Great.
Thank you.
He's hiding something.
Did you see his neck pulse?
Bang, bang, bang.
Don't you have a scrupulous eye for detail.
And he shelves his books alphabetically.
I didn't notice that.
He puts pens in one cup, pencils in another.
Okay.
Now you're scaring me.
Did you see where he put his pen right before we left?
Was Sherlock Holmes a big deal at your parents' bookstore?
Something got Marzotto going.
And you.
I don't like being lied to.
I'll remember that.
So what, you want to go back and hit him again?
No, I want a hard phone line.
I thought this was a colossal waste of time.
Not anymore.
Hey, hold up.
Do you always walk so fast?
Yes, I do.
Are you coming?
Harris.
OPERATOR:
I have an incoming code Madrid for Minnie Harris.
Reply 6955.
Hi, Minnie.
Hey, hotshot.
Hey, how's the White House?
You know, it's a lot smaller than it looks on TV.
How are you?
Chad and I are dating.
Very nice.
Yes, it is.
Look, I need some information.
Okay, shoot.
Edward Marzotto.
One "Z" two "T's."
He's a professor at Southern Iowa University.
Turnaround?
I need it now.
Sorry, I know this is big.
It's not a problem.
You okay to hang on and I'll give you the highlights?
For sure.
Okay, thanks.
Hang on.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Government agents are asking me lots of questions I can't answer without getting you and me into a lot of trouble.
It's about the book.
Your boyfriend is quoting from it.
How's Myka?
Edgy, irritable.
You know, Myka.
Why?
Just checking.
Hey, listen, there's something I forgot to mention before.
What?
Just before Cody got physical, there was some kind of a...
I don't know, a heat wave.
It just rolled right off of him.
This happen after a question?
No, he was talking about his girlfriend, Emily Krueger.
You talked to her, right?
No, not yet.
All right.
Listen.
I'm gonna check out that heat thing.
I'm gonna see if that relates to anything.
And meanwhile, what was that translation?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
Hello?
Artie.
Hey.
Do you want me to...
Do you want me to run that again?
I got it.
Okay, Pete, you're positive that's the translation?
Absolutely positive?
Yeah, I mean, that's what Marzotto said.
Okay, I'll call you back.
PETE:
Okay.
HARRIS:
Myka?
Got some good stuff.
Yeah.
Edward Melville Marzotto.
Melville?
Yeah, I know.
Anyway, the man loves his Italian art.
Just got back from Italy eight weeks ago, and the cops think... (STATIC CRACKLING)
Minnie?
SAM:
Hey, Bunny.
Hey.
Slow down.
Walk faster.
So what'd you find out?
Hey, what happened in there?
Myka, hey.
Tell me.
I heard a...
I thought I heard a voice over the phone that I really should not be hearing.
Same thing you heard at Leena's.
Look, sometimes we hear things and see things that aren't there.
What I heard can't be there.
It can't be.
Then it's not.
I mean, maybe it's post-traumatic stress.
(CHUCKLES)
I read the press release of what went down in Denver.
Lives were saved.
Lives were lost.
You're a hero.
You're gonna put me on a psych eval, aren't you?
Why would I do that?
Because you need to be able to depend on your partner.
All right.
Well, then, you're just gonna have to depend on me to know that you're okay.
We're gonna finish this case, we're gonna get out of here.
We will.
I don't know if I can.
I don't even know what we're looking for.
Yes, you do.
I mean, whatever doesn't fit.
You know, something that's out of place.
Marzotto.
Marzotto lied to us.
He said that the last time he was in Italy was...
Two years ago.
Yeah, my contact told me it was eight weeks ago.
(LAUGHING) How about that?
I wonder what else he lied about.
I guess we need more information.
Yes, we do.
Cody's girlfriend.
Emily Krueger.
I need a picture!
Just give me a picture!
(BEEPING)
Give me a picture.
Don't make me come down there!
All right.
I know this is awkward.
And I feel terrible, but...
You can't keep it.
I don't know what I was thinking even taking it out of Italy, but it has to go back.
I'm going to Rome next week.
And that's coming with me.
What's that for?
(GASPING)
(MUTTERING)
I hate this part.
(GRUNTING)
Ow!
Emily, you're late.
Sorry.
We were setting up for the party.
Can I help you?
Emily Krueger?
Yes.
I know your pain, trust me.
Okay.
Oh!
MYKA:
We saw you leaving Professor Marzotto's office, didn't we?
Oh.
Right.
I was there for a meeting for the play.
I'm in it.
Marzotto's sort of a technical advisor.
Does he know about your relationship with Cody?
He knows what happened.
Why?
Huh.
Because when we talked to him about Cody, he didn't mention you.
Or that you'd just been to see him.
Maybe he was trying to protect my privacy.
Why did you guys mention Cody?
We needed something translated.
Yeah, have you ever heard Cody speak Italian?
Just once, when he did this.
How long have you known Cody?
Since the eighth grade.
Got serious after his parents died.
I came here for theater.
He applied for law school.
His godmother helped him get in.
Lorna Soliday?
You met her?
Does she have any family?
Just Cody.
And that's not even real family.
She made sure that he got that big settlement when his parents died.
(READING IN ITALIAN)
Stop.
Do you know what it means?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
Does that mean anything to you?
Only that he's afraid of abandonment and it scares him.
Maybe he thought that I was spending too much time on the play.
I don't know.
Can I go back to work now?
Yes.
(RECITING IN ITALIAN)
Ten to one, this has nothing to do with the hocus pocus Artie's pushing.
How about a billion to one?
How about a cute girl in a play by Machiavelli makes her insecure boyfriend freak out?
Or try this.
Emily, an actress, is a ruthless gold digger.
She'd know which buttons to push on her insecure boyfriend to get him mad enough to hit her.
Right?
She goes for the money.
(EXCLAIMS) Sues him for it.
What kind of women do you date?
(SIREN WAILING)
Pete?
Pete!
(ARTIE GRUNTING)
(EXCLAIMING SOFTLY)
Pete.
Pete.
It's Marzotto.
What?
The attendant said he heard him speaking Italian before he doused himself.
Hey.
Hey!
Hold on.
Why'd you talk to Marzotto?
Who told you that?
Secret Service hits campus, and people notice.
And now he's dead.
Before this, you said something to make Cody Thomas want to knock your heads off.
Something you want to tell me?
We should talk about this later.
All right, let me tell you something...
Sure.
Tell me something that makes it seem like I couldn't kick your ass in front of your men.
Boys, boys, can we put our badges back in our pants, please?
Sheriff.
What was that?
We gotta get to Marzotto's office.
Yeah, and how are we gonna get in?
Hotshot.
What the hell is Warehouse 13?
We haven't met.
I'm Mrs. Frederic.
How'd you get in here?
Through a door.
Warehouse 13, is it yours?
It's mine.
And so are Lattimer and Bering.
Excuse me?
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
Never mind.
The vibe thing?
My dad was a fireman.
When I was 12,
I got this feeling one morning that I was never gonna see him again.
You didn't say anything?
I didn't want him to see how scared I was.
He died that night in a house fire, saving a couple of kids.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
So now when you get a feeling...
Yeah.
He got his pen out of his pencil cup.
Well, at least he died happy.
Not funny.
You're right.
Well, that's strange.
What?
The M's are out of order.
Hey, there's something in there.
Is this it?
I don't know.
What if it is?
Then we're done.
So open it.
You open it.
I don't want another ferret or whatever.
(PETE READING)
Don't.
Just in case.
PETE:
What's that?
MYKA:
Something's missing.
Let's call Artie.
Yeah.
Miss Soliday.
What are you doing here?
You heard what happened to Marzotto?
Yes, Sheriff Travis just called.
Now, get out before I call him back and tell him you're searching this office without a warrant.
We're here investigating his suicide.
Ed didn't kill himself.
He had help.
What do you mean?
Somebody broke his heart.
We were together for three years.
And then we weren't.
I thought we were in love, but things change, and he chose someone else.
A student?
Did Emily Krueger break his heart?
And Cody's.
She's a despicable young woman who uses people to get what she wants, and then when she's done using them...
We're looking for something, something about this big.
We think Marzotto had it, but now it's missing.
Did Emily get it, you know, whatever it is?
Why don't you ask her?
She's helping with the party for the play.
Cody's there.
Cody's out?
Emily dropped the charges.
Okay, we should go.
I'm coming with you.
If you're confronting Emily, I need to be there for Cody.
Let's go.
(PANTING)
I gotta lose weight.
MYKA:
Miss Soliday.
Yes?
Do you think Emily would ever hurt Cody?
Not physically.
Even if she tried, she couldn't.
And why not?
Me.
Cody has me.
I made a promise to his parents when I became his godmother that I would always be there to protect him.
It's only a matter of time before Cody realizes Emily's just small-town trash.
Cody is destined for great things, and I'm helping him succeed.
With me, he can do anything or be anyone he wants.
Myka.
Yeah.
Could you pull over for a sec?
Yeah.
(RECITING IN ITALIAN)
PETE:
Stop right there!
(MYKA EXCLAIMING)
(CAR HORN BLARING)
(GASPING)
Hey.
Hi, Myka.
I know you.
(LAUGHS) Well, that's a good sign.
Where am I?
Hospital in Iowa, Seever City.
What happened?
Car accident.
You've been out for two days.
Pete.
How's Pete?
Lattimer's still unconscious.
We don't know.
Myka, there's someone here to see you.
Someone who's gonna help you get back to where you belong.
The President?
(CHUCKLING)
Better.
SAM:
Hey, Bunny.
Hey.
You know you shouldn't be here, right?
I could say the same thing about you.
I think you just did.
(MOANING)
I'm hurt.
That didn't stop you in Denver.
I was late.
No, Bunny.
I was early.
I jumped the gun.
You're dead, Sam.
Hey, Bunny, you need to get up now.
You got a lot of things you need to do.
(HEART BEATING)
Get up.
Bunny, you have to get up now.
Get up.
Myka, get up.
(GASPING)
Pete!
Oh!
Pete!
Lattimer!
Pete!
Wake up, buddy.
Can you hear me?
Come on.
Here we go.
(PETE GROANING)
Okay.
All right.
Wait, wait, wait.
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
You're giving me a wedgie.
What?
Yeah.
Okay.
Just...
You okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
(GROANING)
Sit here and don't move.
I'm just gonna get the book.
If you find a badge, it's mine.
Never mind.
I found it.
(GROANING)
You okay?
PETE:
Yeah.
Soliday crashed the car.
You think?
Where is she?
(SIGHING) She's not here.
She had some kind of jewelry in her hair, like a comb thing.
It looked old, like it would fit in the book.
(FARNSWORTH RINGING)
Pete, you're bleeding.
I'm fine.
Pete.
I'm fine.
Here, answer that.
Yeah?
You're looking for jewelry.
This thing.
Yeah, we know.
We just saw it in a woman's hair.
She tried to kill us.
A woman?
What woman?
MYKA:
Her name is Lorna Soliday.
She's...
Part of the ruling class, single, successful, she's middle-aged.
She's a survivor of family tragedies and the death of loved ones.
She's connected somehow to a young man, a young man that she believes needs her protection?
He's good, yeah.
Pretty good.
Yeah.
What's the matter with you two?
You two all right?
Okay, anyway, look.
This comb is transmitting Lucrezia Borgia.
Lucrezia who?
Borgia.
She's a cutthroat Italian who ruled Italy in the 1600s with her father and brothers.
My family owned a bookstore, remember?
That's right.
That's right.
So what do you mean "the comb's transmitting"?
An alchemist made it, okay?
Out of what, I don't know.
It's supposed to be some kind of Renaissance roofie.
Somehow the crystals in the ionized metal in this thing are affecting brain chemistry.
What about the phrase?
Yeah, the phrase.
Okay.
That's like some kind of phonetic trigger.
This is a very, very, very unhappy woman.
Very unlucky in love.
There's supposed to be a jewelry box.
We found it in Marzotto's office.
He must have given Soliday the comb.
Like her, she wants love at any cost.
She wants love, and she is gonna kill to get it.
Okay, she wants Cody, so she wants Emily gone.
And Emily's at the party.
What are you talking about a party?
What party?
Oh, God.
Some Renaissance blowout for some Machiavelli play.
Machiavelli?
This woman's gonna be there?
Yes.
You've gotta stop this woman.
Lucrezia Borgia, 600 years ago, started a bloody reign of terror, and this comb is gonna wanna start it all over again.
It's got twisted desires, and it'll amplify, it'll spread like some kind of orgiastic virus.
First to Iowa, then to Nebraska, then to Illinois.
We understand.
Probably first to Illinois and then...
Okay, look, we need to get you to a hospital first...
No, no, no, no, no.
Pete.
No, look, I'm trained to take a bullet if necessary.
But I'm not sure how to stop a dead Italian cougar.
(TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING)

You flank.
No, you flank.
Trust me.
Okay.
Okay.
That's not creepy.
(CLEARING THROAT)
How you doing?
Ooh.
That's nice.
Cody!
Cody.
Come on, man, you don't wanna do this.
Okay.
Look.
Hey, hey.
Hey, you don't wanna hurt her.
Okay.
Just let Emily go.
Oh, he intends to.
Her dying scream will be the trigger...
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, nobody's screaming, okay?
We're gonna take a deep breath, we're all gonna come back down to Earth.
Cute.
Cody.
Kid's fast.
What's your pain, Lorna?
What are you afraid of?
You know.
And so does she.
Show's over.
Drop the comb thing.
Did you really let your lover die?
Myka.
Shut up.
For a chance at glory?
I said shut up.
Don't look at it, Myka.
Myka!

You can come back to D.C. , or you can stay with the new assignment.
What's the catch?
I only get you.
Lattimer has to stay there.
And if I stay, what happens to Pete?
He still stays.
How long do I have to think about it?
About five more seconds.
Four, three, two.
(WHOOSHING)
and other great stuff here in our nation's capital, there's one thing you're gonna love probably more than anything else... the dinosaurs.
This way.
Stick together.
Agent Bering?
- Hi, Chet Greenfield.
- Hello.
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.
My assistant said you double-checked everything yesterday.
I did, but I'd like to run a full review before we lock it down.
Sure.
- With you.
- Me?
You're the boss.
I'd like to avoid any chain-of-command confusion.
I tell you, and it gets done.
- Shall we start in the main hall?
- Well, I understand,
- but I'm pretty booked upright now.
- I apologize for the inconvenience.
- I'll clear my schedule.
- I'd appreciate that, sir.
Good morning, Kacey.
I just figured out who you are.
You're a fireman.
No.
Come on.
You know absolutely everything about me.
Well, that's because you talk a lot.
Gordon, this is agent Bering with the Secret Service.
Gordon Letanik?
And what's...
What's this?
An Aztec blood stone.
The boss of virgin sacrifices.
Handsome devil.
I'm just cleaning him for the reception tonight.
Agent Bering wants the group D artifacts moved to the west wall.
They're blocking an exit.
Lose Tuvalu and Malta.
Move Britain to the back.
If it still doesn't fit, see me and we'll cut something else.
Yes, sir.
I'll just finish up.
What's next?
The main floor bathrooms.
I'll need the plumbing pulled again.
I would try to sneak you in, but the Secret Service will be there, and they can be jerks.
So I've heard.
Call you soon.
You promise?
Promise.
Bye now.
Champagne?
Thank you.
Champagne?
Cham...
Status check on Eagle.
- Who's on Emerald entrance?
- Me.
Morris.
Why aren't you at Emerald?
Well, because I'm here.
- How's Home Base?
- We're calling Home Base "Magenta".
Well, I'm not.
- You changed the protocol.
- I tweaked it.
I wrote it.
And I didn't use colors.
Why weren't you at my briefing?
I was vetting one of the servers.
- Screwing off is more like it.
- Well, you say po-tah-to.
- Get back to Emerald.
- You're not my superior.
Dickinson gave this to me.
I'm running it.
- Meeka.
- Myka.
I get... vibes.
Sorry?
This isn't some run and gun that you're used to in Denver.
- Get to the point, Lattimer.
- Dickinson gave you this shindig with my protocol because my specialty is logistics, framing... and I kid you not, there is something really off in here.
Eagle at Magenta.
Mr. President, wait a moment, please.
This is Bering.
Eagle is free to enter.
Negative, negative.
This is Lattimer.
Hold Eagle at five until further.
- Copy?
- Copy.
Holding Eagle.
Get back to Emerald.
Look, Myka, why don't you pull your head out of your Magenta and feel the room.
- Something's off.
- Listen, Showboat.
Nothing's off.
The room is fine.
Everything is fine.
Now take your vibe... and go.
- Enjoy your party.
- I will.
I want a perimeter check asap.
- Emerald clear.
- Peach clear.
- Orange clear.
- Gold clear.
Crimson clear.
There's...
There's blood, so...
Pete?
- What are you doing here?
- Working.
Is there a fire?
- Excuse me, sir.
Wait just a second.
- Secret Service.
This is...
Gotta go.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
That's an okay for Eagle to enter.
Affirmative.
Clear Eagle.
Freeze!
Drop the knife.
Hold your fire!
Seriously, Gordon, drop the knife.
Drop that.
- Whatever it is.
- Can't do that, Pete.
Weapon.
We're done here.
Tell me you found the guy.
The guy who you said stole the rock?
We're gonna need a sample.
Come on, Dickinson.
Well, you said, among many strange things,
- that the rock was bleeding.
- It was.
Taxpayers will probably wanna know if you were high, paranoid, or just part of an Aztec art theft ring.
In the meantime, you're suspended, with pay, for two weeks, till we get this thing worked out.
- What about Morris?
- He says nothing happened at emerald.
Okay, can we... stop with the colors already?
What about...
the guy with the knife?
- What, Letanik?
- Yes.
He's in a coma.
Docs don't know why or how long that's gonna last.
- And Bering?
- Myka's being thanked personally by the President and the first lady.
- Of course she is.
- She's going places.
You, on the other hand, you're going to the bathroom.
That's funny.
Mr. Lattimer.
My name's Frederic.
Frederic what?
- Mrs. Frederic.
- Well, that's a relief.
I'm with the government.
I'm here on a matter of national security.
- What's that?
- An invitation to endless wonder.
Could you sound a little more creepy?
Read it.
Please note the action code.
It is legitimate.
- You're part of my bailiwick now.
- Your bailiwick?
- You're working for me.
- For you?
- Am I stuttering?
- No, ma'am.
All right, I get it.
It's a... this is a joke, right?
Dickinson put you guys up...
This is Dickinson being funny, right?
Do I look like a joke?
You're to be in South Dakota at those coordinates at noon tomorrow.
You will mention our meeting and your pending assignment to no one.
Is that understood?
How long am I gonna be in South Dakota?
- Indefinitely.
- Indef... no, no.
I've got a life here.
Really?
I've got... things.
Pack light, Mr. Lattimer.
We'll ship what you need and store the rest.
Prepare to turn right in 100 feet.
Turn right now.
You have missed your turn.
Go back.
Turn right.
Destination straight ahead.
You gotta be kidding me.
Endless wonder.
It's agent Lattimer!
I'm here!
Great.
- I heard you were suspended.
- Yeah, I heard that too.
Why are you here?
I was ordered here, last night.
Mrs. Frederic.
Said it was a matter of...
National security.
Right.
How are you guys doing?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to fix the fish.
- Stop right there.
- What are you doing?
This is the guy.
The one from last night.
- The guy who stole the rock.
- You stole the rock.
It's a blood stone.
It's safe.
It's inside the building.
It's the property of the museum.
And that museum is property of the Government, so is the warehouse.
And so am I.
I'm secret service.
I also work for Mrs. Frederic.
I'm Dr. Nielson.
You can call me Artie.
Got some ID?
We take the secret part seriously around here.
I just wanted to thank you for your assist in last night's retrieval.
That was very good.
Did you throw that foot ball at me?
You weren't here when I threw it.
It takes a while to circle back.
Come on inside.
- I'll show you around.
- Around what?
What am I doing here?
I'll explain everything inside.
Come on.
I made cookies.
Come on.
Really, it's okay.
Go inside.
Don't go far!
Okay.
Come on in.
Wait for me at the bottom of the stairs.
It's fine.
Don't touch anything.
Don't touch the bombs.
Hold this.
Hold it.
Come on.
It's okay.
Right this way.
Ms. Bering, Mr. Lattimer, welcome to Warehouse 13.
- I'm thrilled you're on the team.
- What team?
What is this place?
Officially, K-39 triple-Z on the North American grid.
But...
I like to think of it as America's attic.
Projet-SG (1.00)
Pete, close the door.
Tell me exactly what I'm doing here.
Exactly?
That's a little dif...
Well, to put it plainly, you're both joining me as fellow gatherers and protectors of secrets.
Put it plainer.
This...
This warehouse...
Look, the Warehouse needs you.
It needs...
Pete, don't touch.
It needs your combined talents.
He's intuitive, and you're...
You've got a scrupulous eye for detail.
He's scattershot, and you're meticulous.
You look, he leaps.
There's been a mistake.
I'm too valuable to be wasted here.
No offense.
- Of course not.
- Can I use your phone, please?
Mine?
It's broken.
- I have to make a phone call, so...
- There's no signal here.
Yeah, you're...
You're...
Just pull...
Pull the door, and you'll be... now.
There you go.
I think she had other plans.
So did I.
You want juice or are you a milk person?
- You know what I'd really like?
- I do indeed, but falling off the wagon may not be the best option at this point.
- Milk it is.
- Yeah.
- That's Mrs. Frederic.
- Long time ago.
- She looks exactly the same.
- Odd, isn't it?
You don't want a cookie?
- So who are these guys?
- Former colleagues.
And where are they now?
This one and this one are dead.
This one, a mental institution in Germany.
And this last one... disappeared.
One day I'll find him.
Ted, these are two of my best agents.
How can you not know?
I'm looking at the order.
You processed it.
How can't you know?
Hold on.
- Dickinson.
- Sir, it's Myka Bering.
Sir, I have a little situation here.
I'm not sure...
Yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I'm looking at the transfer order.
The name on here is Frederic.
You're transferred to where?
- Where are you?
- I'm in South Dakota.
- Where?
- South Dakota.
- What are you doing in South Dakota?
- You don't know about this?
No.
Who is Frederic?
Sir?
Sir?
- Who's this Frederic?
- Sir!
Yes, yes.
She handed me orders last night to come here to a warehouse in South Dakota.
The order code was solid, and Lattimer's here too.
Look, I'm requesting an immediate stand down and transfer back to DC.
Myka.
Myka, I can't do that, okay?
This order trumps me.
Let me get on this, I'll get you back here asap.
- What should I do?
- Follow orders.
- Those orders, both of you.
- And how long will this take?
Sir?
Sir?
Are you still there?
That's a pile of crap.
- No kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.
You're actually standing in a big pile of cow manure.
- Oatmeal scotchie?
- No.
Thank you.
I don't eat sugar.
Good for you.
Listen...
Please don't think of this assignment, you know, as some sort of punishment.
- Can you hold this?
- What?
You know, yeah, your presence here is not really a reaction to what happened to you in Denver.
So...
I got a commendation for what happened in Denver.
Yes, you did.
It's time for the nickel tour.
Come on.
The order trumps Dickinson?
The first Warehouse 13 was built in '98.
- So we're stuck.
- Until he works out a transfer, yes.
1898.
We didn't have a handle on how to store stuff.
It burned down.
Some remodeling and excavations were necessary as the years went on to accommodate the arrival of more and more and more and more artifacts.
What's stored here, exactly?
This and that.
Bric-a-brac.
Some things along the lines of... last night's rock and roll.
I'm talking about the blood stone.
Both hands... on the bar, please.
I think I'll survive a crash.
No, that's not a safety bar.
It's a conduit.
You and Pete are the power source.
Your combined electrical energy makes this thing move.
It's fine, it's fine.
Look, Thomas Edison built this automobile for Henry Ford as a proof of concept, and it's perfectly safe.
Trust me.
Put your hands on the bar.
Put your hands on the bar.
Thank you.
We need both of you.
Hands on the bar, Myka.
Thank you.
Edison, he wanted Ford to let go of oil, but Ford, no, no, he stuck with it because it ruined his engines faster.
People had to keep buying them.
- What is that?
- What?
That is training flight 22.
We pulled that from the Bermuda Triangle.
The Triangle's been trying to pull it back ever since.
Duck and cover.
It's harmless.
The inventory kicks up a little static from time to time.
Why are you grinning?
Well, don't you think this stuff is kind of cool?
I mean...
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He'll be back.
- Hello?
- We should stick together.
Right this way, please.
Many of the items in here, kind of like the blood stone, Pete, that you wrestled with last night, the channel of tangential energy...
Well, tangential energy is kind of like the energy that forced the museum employee, last night, into... well, into almost committing murder.
- So how does that happen?
- We're not really exactly sure how.
It goes back to Einstein, and E equals...
Yeah, okay.
Somehow... the matter that is in here has just enough energy to move other matter.
You know, like you.
- Move me where?
- Into trouble.
Bunk.
Is gravity bunk?
Magnetism?
These are mysterious forces that we live with, but we can't explain 'em.
Can you even explain to me how a radio works?
And you don't care, as long as you get the traffic report.
But if a radio landed in the hands of Thomas Jefferson, you know what Jefferson would do?
He would just lock it up until he figured out it wasn't gonna kill him.
And that is exactly... what we do here.
We take the unexplained... and we just safely tuck it away in this super-sized Pandora's box.
- Metaphorically speaking.
- Pandora's box is over in aisle 989B.
Empty, of course.
Do the world a favor and clear your mind.
Well, that should be easy.
How did that get there?
'Cause I didn't pick that thing up.
It still amazes me how that thing moves.
What?
What is it?
Don't talk, don't hope, don't wish for anything.
- That kettle grants wishes?
- Yes.
Now Pete, look at me.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Open it.
Pete!
Pete, this...
This is a neutralizer.
You can think of this as a fire extinguisher for objects that act up.
Now look, I want you to come over here and drop that slowly, right in here.
There are items around here, if you were to put it in there, they would generate a flash, but this will be a little spark.
But you may flinch, and I don't want to, 'cause you could drop it, okay?
- Well, I have a wish.
- Don't!
- You wished for a ferret?
- No.
- That was already in the thing.
- I don't think so.
You wished for a transfer, didn't you?
Impossible wishes, wishes that can never be granted, they produce a ferret.
Don't ask me why.
My first year here, the whole place was crawling with ferrets.
- I swear, I didn't pick that thing up.
- No, I know, I know.
Not everybody is affected by everything.
Here, okay?
You have to be metaphysically predisposed.
And the external energies, they have to be in alignment.
- This is just a convergence thing.
- Right, sure, okay.
So we're...
we're all converged here, but I still have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
What you're supposed to do is hunt down whatever is threatening to ruin the world's day, neutralize it and bring it here.
You gotta snag it and bag it and tag it.
This is crazy!
This is crazy!
You know, I don't...
It could be, you know, crazy fun.
That's the attitude that brought you to our attention.
Do you guys want a cookie for the road?
What road?
There's rooms for you at Leena's Bed and Breakfast.
It's about 7 miles down the road that way, and I'll join you there in the morning and I'll tou...
I'll just join you there in the morning.
Stay close!
Seriously, Lattimer, there's been a serious screw-up.
I'm serious.
And now you have a ferret.
What?
This town...
Is this a town or what?
- What's the name of it?
- Well, it's more like a street.
So it says here to turn left at Buffalo Station.
What?
No, no, no.
It's "Buffalo Statue".
Well, your penmanship is atrocious.
I don't need wise...
You know, that's...
You know, don't do that.
Can you finish a sentence?
A full thought?
Would you really like me to?
Wait.
No, no, no.
Don't... don't call Dickinson.
- He hates being pestered.
- I don't pester.
When he knows something, he'll call.
Clearly the phrase "rolling with the punches"
is not in your vocabulary, so may I make a suggestion?
What might that be?
Unbunch your panties... and make the best of a bad situation.
And how do I do that?
Which part?
You're a freak.
Hello.
I'm Leena.
You must be Pete and Myka.
Come in.
I've got your rooms ready.
We serve three meals, 9:00, noon, and 5:00.
We've got radios in the rooms.
No tvs.
No in-room phones, but there is one there at the bottom of the stairs in the hallway.
You may choose any room.
Is there anywhere I can get a drink?
I mean, a drink... drink?
- What would you like?
- Whiskey neat.
- I can do that.
- Please do that.
She hates traveling.
She loves traveling.
It's the places she's traveled to that's the problem.
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm fine.
Just...
- Is everything okay?
- You're a lucky man, Pete.
I am?
You're in tune.
Very rare.
I don't know what that mea...
Look... are you... are you connected to Artie?
Let me know if your bed is big enough for you.
Hey, buddy.
- How'd it go today?
- Not bad.
Lattimer seems interested.
And Ms. Bering, not so much.
Did you select a case for them?
I don't mean any disrespect, but are we really sure they're the right people?
Because...
I'm fully aware of their baggage.
Now what's the real problem?
Artie, take yourself off the hook.
Their fate falls on me.
You say that...
Dickinson wants them back.
You've got to get them locked in.
Can't sleep?
Yeah.
Me neither.
We don't have to talk.
So...
- Do you always eat when stressed?
- Do you always talk this much?
You know, no light from the city to get in the way.
Nothing but sky.
This time of the year, we get Leo,
Cygnus, Sagittarius.
You know this how?
My dad and I used to camp a lot.
Where is he now?
Sorry.
What about your folks?
Colorado Springs.
They own a bookstore called Bering and Sons.
- How many brothers?
- No brothers.
Just me.
My dad thought the "and Sons" sounded classier.
He must be proud of you.
Mom is.
Well, did protecting the president of the United States turn him around?
This won't.
From Denver to DC to a warehouse security guard in six months.
Now there's a career trajectory.
Look, about Denver,
I didn't mean to spit on that last night.
What you did there was better than textbook.
We're not discussing that.
Ever.
All right, well, I'm gonna... go back upstairs... and not sleep some more.
Earlier, did you hear a...
Hear what?
Never mind.
Dickinson will call.
He better.
Rotation, time,
Seever City.
Come on.
So it's gonna be you, then.
Cody Thomas, a law school grad student, at the university of Southern Iowa.
- Iowa?
- Yeah, Iowa.
His parents were killed in a plane crash.
He is a really good kid, putting himself through college with the settlement.
Why are we going to Iowa?
To find whatever it is that pushed this kid over the edge.
- What edge?
- He struck his girlfriend.
That's it?
So far.
For the past five days, I have been reviewing 11 possible cases, looking for whatever doesn't fit, something out of place, like blood on a marble floor that leads to a man with a knife.
Because of a rock that isn't just a rock.
I've got a hunch that this is the one.
What exactly are we looking for?
Well, you tell me.
It's bigger than a breadbox...
Or smaller.
If there is an artifact at the heart of this, then I've prepared a few questions for Cody that might reveal it.
Actually, it's more than a few questions, but...
"Do you have the constant feeling that today is yesterday?"
If they say yes, then we could...
They probably won't say yes.
It's unlikely.
- We could be dealing with time slip.
- Or a hangover.
Please take this seriously.
I had a run-in with a Mayan calendar few years ago, that question saved my life.
And the two agents that were with me were not quite so lucky.
What happened to them?
Their clocks...
Stopped.
So, what?
They died?
They'll wish they had in 100 years or so.
Anyway...
Neutralizer.
The purple stuff.
If you find the artifact, just drown it in there, like this, if you can.
And if it's too big, you just take this and throw it, and then call me.
And don't ask me how it works, because I have no idea.
And it doesn't always work.
And don't ingest that stuff, because you'll... see things.
And we'll stay in contact with these.
I have one just like it.
- Two-way video communication?
- I call it a Farnsworth.
Named after Philo Farnsworth, who invented that in 1929, right after he invented the television.
Isn't that remarkable?
I mean, anyway, if you wanna talk to me, just press that button.
What is that?
Nicola Tesla,
Thomas Edison's chief rival or nemesis, depending, he cooked this up as an alternative to bullets.
It's a...
It's really... a kind of electric stun gun.
A polyphase ass-kicker.
Now, that's...
Just here.
Just don't put it past two to begin with.
That's the trigger, right there.
You should practice with it first.
One blast and down you go.
Don't point that at me.
Keep your finger away.
Just don't.
Give him the gun.
And also, it zaps short-term memory, which is why agent Morris doesn't remember seeing me at the museum.
And that's it.
That's what?
Go to Iowa.
Talk to Cody.
Find the artifact, if it exists.
Neutralize it and bring it back.
Don't get killed.
- How's her aura?
- Tortured.
Guilt and grief, mostly.
She has a soft spot for the ferret.
Just like you.
Now that was a long time ago.
You haven't changed that much.
She had a stowaway.
I found this in her room.
Oh, Lord, that's Houdini's wallet.
Fingers!
That was a bad spike.
That landed on something with her.
I requisitioned mesh screens for those shelves ten years ago.
And every year since.
- I've told you this.
- A few times.
You'd think Mrs. Frederic could maybe get that done.
Don't look at me.
Well, I had the FBI in here a while ago on a suspected terrorist thing.
All egos out to here and all looking like they're wearing daddy's suit.
Well, we feel the same way.
Let me know if the thing's going federal so I can prepare my staff for the media.
It's not going federal.
We just have a few questions and then we're gone.
It's Dickinson.
- Just a sec.
- Yeah, this is Bering.
- How you doing?
- We're in Iowa now, on assignment.
- Any luck in getting us back?
- The bad news is not so far.
The good news is, I've got a line on this Frederic woman.
She worked for the Treasury Department in the 1950s, and after...
Well, it's not the same woman.
The woman we met was younger.
I've got a Frederic in charge of some sort of secret sandbox.
Funded from a black ops budget I'm still trying to source.
I can fill you in.
These lines aren't secure.
Listen to me.
I'm doing everything I can to get you and Pete back here.
48 hours, tops.
So just follow your current orders and keep your head down.
Wait, sir!
Sir?
So how'd he sound?
48 hours.
- Yeah, but how'd he sound?
- Not good.
- What kind of questions?
- They're sort of diagnostic.
Diagnostic.
Like I'm sick?
You're Secret Service doctors?
Question number one.
"Have you recently encountered something that you feel has affected your life?"
Something like...
An object of some kind.
Do handcuffs count?
Question number two. "While looking up, do you have the sensation of falling?"
I don't feel like I'm falling.
- Next question.
- Okay, question number three.
"Have you recently smelled something that could best be described
- "as fudge when there is no fudge?"
- Fudge?
Is that...
Question four.
"Do you have ever feel like this might be a colossal waste of time?"
Okay, so...
We're done with those questions...
What do you think happened with your girlfriend?
- What's her name?
- I don't know.
Emily.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
I was in class, talking to the professor about some mock trial thing.
I woke up here, and they told me I beat Emily up.
- Have they let you see a doctor?
- Yeah.
- Says I'm fine.
- And no...
- No alcohol or drugs?
- No, I swear.
No history of blackouts?
This isn't me.
I would never hurt Emily.
This isn't me.
This isn't...
Se li uomini sapessino le cagioni della paura mia, capir potrebbero il mio dolor.
Get him out of here!
Let's get him down to secure lockup.
Well, that was scary.
Can you come this way, son?
Hello.
I'm Lorna Soliday.
I'm Cody's lawyer.
And did Travis call you?
Sheriff Travis respects the law, and he doesn't like being railroaded by federal agents.
Are you that hands-on with all your clients?
- Just my godson.
- So you knew his parents.
Very well.
And neither Cody nor I will be answering any more questions
- until I know what this is about.
- We're interested in Cody's behavior.
- His violent behavior.
- As in, where's it coming from?
What is this?
Someone pegged him as a threat to the President?
Not yet.
Not ever.
That's not Cody.
It was Cody that just destroyed that table.
Not to mention what he did to his girlfriend.
Does the secret service investigate every case
- of battery among college students?
- Nope.
Just this one.
- So where'd the Italian come in?
- What do you mean?
He spoke Italian in there, just before he decided
- that the interview was over.
- I don't know anything about that.
Well, has Cody come into contact with anything unusual, say, in the past few days?
- Yes.
You two.
- That was a serious question.
That was a serious answer.
Any more questions, Sheriff Travis has my number.
You felt that, right?
I'm not sure what you mean.
It got hot.
But you knew to get me to the floor before he freaked out.
The vibe.
Right.
Okay, so how do those things work?
Is there false alarms or...
- It happens all the time.
- So why do you trust them?
One time I didn't, and I should have.
You're right.
It's Italian, sort of.
I mean, this is either part gibberish.
I don't know.
It's some kind of code, maybe.
And my software can barely translate any of this and says "dolor"
means "pain."
And a text search came up with nothing.
There's no films, no books, no plays, no songs, no poems.
So what now?
You're right beside a college campus.
You can go find somebody who speaks Italian.
Excuse me.
Professor Marzotto?
We're with the secret service.
Oh, my.
It's an old construction.
15th century.
It's not working-class Italian either.
This is high brow.
- So what's he saying?
- Roughly?
"If people knew
"the reasons for my fear,
"they'd be able to understand my pain."
Do you visit Italy a lot?
I haven't been back in nearly two years.
But you're sure this translation is correct.
I'm a Renaissance scholar.
I'm sure.
One last question.
Do you know a student here named Cody Thomas?
I know of him.
I read about him in the paper.
It's a sad story.
- How so?
- Well, you know.
He was a good kid, from what I heard.
And he had some sort of a breakdown.
All right, well, if we need you to translate anything else...
I'd be more than happy to help.
You can reach me at that number.
Great.
Thank you.
He's hiding something.
Did you see his neck pulse?
Don't you have a scrupulous eye for detail.
- He shelves his books alphabetically.
- I didn't notice that.
And he puts pens in one cup, pencils in another.
Now you're scaring me.
Did you see where he put his pen right before we left?
Was Sherlock Holmes a big deal at your parents' bookstore?
- Something got Marzotto going.
- And you.
I don't like being lied to.
I'll remember that.
Do you want to go back and hit him again?
No, I want a hard phone line.
I thought this was a colossal waste of time.
Not anymore.
Hold up.
- Do you always walk so fast?
- Yes, I do.
Are you coming?
I have an incoming code Madrid for Minnie Harris.
Reply 6955.
- Hi, Minnie.
- Hey, hotshot.
- How's the White House?
- You know, it's a lot smaller than it looks on TV.
How are you?
- Chad and I are dating.
- Very nice.
Yes, it is.
- Look, I need some information.
- Okay, shoot.
Edward Marzotto, one "z" two "t"s.
- Professor at Southern Iowa University.
- Turnaround?
I need it now.
Sorry, I know this is big.
It's not a problem.
Hang on and I'll give you the highlights?
- For sure.
- Thanks.
Hang on.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Government agents are asking me lots of questions I can't answer without getting you and me into a lot of trouble.
It's about the book.
Your boyfriend is quoting from it.
How's Myka?
Edgy, irritable.
You know, Myka.
- Why?
- Just checking.
Listen, there's something I forgot to mention before.
- What?
- Just before Cody got physical, there was some kind of a...
I don't know, a heat wave.
It just rolled right off of him.
This happen after a question?
No, he was talking about his girlfriend, Emily Krueger.
- You talked to her, right?
- No, not yet.
All right.
Listen,
I'm gonna check out that heat thing, and see if that relates to anything.
And... meanwhile, what was that translation?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
Do you want me to...
Do you want me to run that again?
I got it.
You're positive that's the translation?
Absolutely positive?
Yeah, I mean, that's what Marzotto said.
- I'll call you back.
- Okay.
Got some good stuff.
Edward Melville Marzotto.
- Melville?
- Yeah, I know.
Anyway, the man loves his Italian art.
He just got back from Italy eight weeks ago, and the cops think...
Hey, bunny.
- Slow down.
- Walk faster.
So what'd you find out?
What happened in there?
Tell me.
I heard a...
I thought I heard... a voice over the phone that I really should not be hearing.
Same thing you heard at Leena's.
Look, sometimes we...
We hear things
- and see things that aren't there.
- What I heard can't be there.
- It can't be.
- Then it's not.
I mean, maybe it's post-traumatic stress.
I read the press release of what went down in Denver.
- Lives were saved.
- Lives were lost.
You're a hero.
You're gonna put me on a psych eval, aren't you?
Why would I do that?
Because you need to be able to depend on your partner.
All right, well, then you're just gonna have to depend on me to know that you're okay.
We're gonna finish this case, we're gonna get out of here.
We will.
I don't know if I can.
I don't even know what we're looking for.
Yes, you do.
I mean, whatever doesn't fit.
You know, something that's out of place.
Marzotto lied to us.
He said that the last time
- he was in Italy was...
- Two years ago.
Yeah, my contact told me it was eight weeks ago.
How'bout that?
I wonder what else he lied about.
- I guess we need more information.
- Yes, we do.
- Cody's girlfriend.
- Emily Krueger.
I need a picture!
Just give me a picture.
Give me a picture.
Don't make me come down there!
All right.
I know this is... awkward.
And I feel terrible, but...
You can't keep it.
I don't know what I was thinking even taking it out of Italy, but it has to go back.
I'm going to Rome next week.
And that's coming with me.
What's that for?
I hate this part.
- Emily, you're late.
- Sorry.
We were setting up for the party.
Can I help you?
Emily Krueger?
I know your pain, trust me.
We saw you leaving professor Marzotto's office, didn't we?
Oh, right.
I was there for a meeting.
For the play.
I'm in it.
Marzotto's sort of a technical advisor.
Does he know about your relationship with Cody?
He knows what happened.
Why?
Because when we talked to him about Cody, he didn't mention you.
Or that you'd just been to see him.
Maybe he was trying to protect my privacy.
- Why did you guys mention Cody?
- We needed something translated.
Yeah, have you ever heard Cody speak Italian?
Just once, when he did this.
- How long have you known Cody?
- Since the eighth grade.
Got serious after his parents died.
I came here for theater.
He applied for law school.
His godmother helped him get in.
- Lorna Soliday?
- You met her?
- Does she have any family?
- Just Cody.
And that's not even real family.
She made sure that he got that big settlement when his parents died.
Do you know what it means?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Only that he's afraid of abandonment.
It scares him.
Maybe he thought that I was spending too much time on the play.
I don't know.
Can I go back to work now?
Ten to one this has nothing to do with the hocus pocus Artie's pushing.
How'bout a billion to one?
How about a cute girl in a play by Machiavelli makes her insecure boyfriend freak out?
Or... or try this.
Emily, an actress, is a ruthless gold digger.
She'd know which buttons to push on her insecure boyfriend to get him made enough to hit her.
She goes for the money.
Sues him for it.
What kind of women do you date?
- It's Marzotto.
- What?
The attendant said he heard him speaking Italian before he doused himself.
Hold on.
Why'd you talk to marzotto?
Who told you that?
Secret service hits campus, and people notice.
And now he's dead.
Before this, you said something to make Cody want to knock your heads off.
- Something you want to tell me?
- We should talk later.
- Let me tell you something...
- Sure.
Something that makes it seem like I couldn't kick your ass in front of your men.
Boys, can we put our badges back in our pants, please?
Sheriff.
What was that?
- We gotta get to Marzotto's office.
- And how are we gonna get in?
Hotshot.
What the hell is Warehouse 13?
We haven't met.
I'm Mrs. Frederic.
- How'd you get in here?
- Through a door.
Warehouse 13, is it yours?
It's mine.
And so are Lattimer and Bering.
Excuse me?
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
Never mind.
The vibe thing?
My dad was a... fireman.
When I was 12,
I got this feeling one morning that I was never gonna see him again.
And you didn't say anything?
I didn't want him to see how scared I was.
He died that night in a house fire, saving a couple of kids.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
So now when you get a feeling...
- He got his pen out of his pencil cup.
- At least he died happy.
That's not funny.
You're right.
That's strange.
What?
The "m"s are out of order.
There's something in there.
- Is this it?
- I don't know.
- Well, what if it is?
- Then we're done.
- So open it.
- You open it.
I don't want another ferret or whatever.
- Se li uomini...
- Don't.
Just in case.
- What's that?
- Something's missing.
Let's call Artie.
Miss Soliday.
- What are you doing here?
- You heard what happened to Marzotto?
Yes, Sheriff Travis just called.
Now get out before I call him back and tell him you're searching this office without a warrant.
We're here investigating his suicide.
Ed didn't kill himself.
- He had help.
- What do you mean?
Somebody broke his heart.
We were together for three years.
And then we weren't.
I thought we were in love, but things change, and he chose someone else.
A student?
Did Emily Krueger break his heart?
And Cody's.
She's a despicable young woman who uses people to get what she wants, and then when she's done using them...
We're looking for something, something about this big.
We think Marzotto had it, but now it's missing.
Did Emily get it, you know, whatever it is?
Why don't you ask her?
She's helping with the party for the play.
Cody's there.
- Cody's out?
- Emily dropped the charges.
- Okay, we should go.
- I'm coming with you.
If you're confronting Emily, I need to be there for Cody.
Let's go.
I gotta lose weight.
Do you think Emily would ever hurt Cody?
Not physically.
Even if she tried, she couldn't.
And why not?
Me.
Cody has me.
I made a promise to his parents when I became his godmother that I would always be there to protect him.
It's only a matter of time before Cody realizes
Emily's just small-town trash.
Cody is destined for great things, and I'm helping him succeed.
With me, he can do anything or be anyone he wants.
Could you pull over for a sec?
I know you.
Well, that's a good sign.
Where am I?
Hospital.
In Iowa.
Seever City.
What happened?
Car accident.
You've been out for two days.
How's Pete?
Lattimer's still unconscious.
We don't know.
There's someone here to see you.
Someone who's gonna help you get back to where you belong.
The President?
Better.
Hey, bunny.
Hey.
You know you shouldn't be here, right?
I could say the same thing about you.
I think you just did.
I'm hurt.
That didn't stop you in Denver.
- I was late.
- No, bunny.
I was early.
I jumped the gun.
You're dead, Sam.
You need to get up now.
You got a lot of things you need to do.
Get up.
You have to get up now.
Get up.
Wake up, buddy.
Can you hear me?
Come on.
Here we go.
All right.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?
What?
What?
- You're giving me a wedgie.
- What?
Just... you okay?
Sit here and don't move.
I'm just gonna get the book.
If you find a badge, it's mine.
Never mind.
I found it.
You okay?
Soliday crashed the car.
You think?
Where is she?
She's not here.
She had... some kind of jewelry in her hair, like a comb thing.
It looked old, like it would fit in the book.
- Pete, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Just... here, answer that.
You're looking for jewelry.
This, this thing.
Yeah, we know.
We just saw it in a woman's hair.
- She tried to kill us.
- A woman?
What woman?
Her name is Lorna Soliday.
She's...
Part of the ruling class, single, successful, middle-aged.
She's a survivor of family tragedies and the death of loved ones.
She's connected somehow to a young man, that she believes needs her protection?
He's good, yeah.
What's the matter with you two?
Okay, anyway, look.
This comb is transmitting Lucretia Borgia.
- Lucretia who?
- Borgia.
She's a cutthroat Italian who ruled Italy in the 1600s with her father and brothers.
My family owned a book store, remember?
That's right.
So what do you mean the comb's transmitting?
An alchemist made it, okay?
Out of what, I don't know.
It's supposed to be some kind of Renaissance roofie.
Somehow the crystals in the ionized metal are affecting brain chemistry.
- What about the phrase?
- Yeah, the phrase.
That's like some kind of phonetic trigger.
This is a very, very, very unhappy woman.
Very unlucky in love.
- There's supposed to be a jewelry box.
- We found it in Marzotto's office.
He must have given Soliday the comb.
Like her, she wants love at any cost.
She wants love, and she is gonna kill to get it.
She wants...
She wants Cody, so she wants Emily gone.
And Emily's at the party.
What are you talking about a party?
What party?
God.
Some renaissance blowout for some Machiavelli play.
Machia...
This woman's gonna be there?
You've gotta stop this woman.
Lucretia Borgia, 600 years ago, started a bloody reign of terror, and this comb is gonna wanna start it all over again.
It's got twisted desires, and it'll amplify, it'll spread like some kind of orgiastic virus.
First to Iowa, then to Nebraska, then to Illinois.
We understand.
Probably first to Illinois and then...
Okay, look, we need to get you to a hospital first and...
No, look, I'm trained to take a bullet if necessary.
But...
I'm not sure how to stop a dead Italian cougar.
We need some kind of approach.
Well, I have no more color-coded plans.
There's a silver lining.
Okay, I'll go in, grab Cody.
- You flank.
- No, you flank.
Trust me.
That's not creepy.
How you doing?
That's nice.
Come on, man, you don't wanna do this.
Look.
You don't wanna hurt her.
Just let Emily go.
He intends to.
Her dying scream will be the trigger...
Look, nobody's screaming, okay?
We're gonna take a deep breath, and we're all gonna come back down to Earth.
Cute.
Kid's fast.
What's your pain, Lorna?
What are you afraid of?
You know.
And so does she.
Show's over.
Drop the comb... thing.
Did you really let your lover die?
- Shut up.
- For a chance at glory?
I said shut up.
Don't look at it, Myka.
Yeah, sorry.
No one's dying here tonight.
But you might lose a tooth.
Duck and cover?
- What did I do?
- It's okay.
It's over.
Love hurts, I know.
So here's the deal.
You got a choice.
You can come back to DC.
Or you can stay with the new assignment.
- What's the catch?
- I only get you.
Lattimer has to stay there.
- And if I stay, what happens to Pete?
- He still stays.
- How long do I have to think about it?
- About five more seconds.
Four, three, two.

Now, in addition to all the museums and art galleries and other great stuff here in our nation's capital, there's one thing you're gonna love probably more than anything else.
The dinosaurs.
This way.
Stick together.
Agent Bering?
Hi, Chet Greenfield.
Hello.
Sorry I'm late.
No problem.
My assistant said you double checked everything yesterday.
I did, but I'd like to run a full review before we lock it down.
Sure.
With you.
Me?
You're the boss.
I'd like to avoid any chain-of-command confusion.
I tell you, and it gets done.
Shall we start in the main hall?
Well, I understand, but I'm pretty booked up at the moment.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
I'll clear my schedule.
I'd appreciate it.
Morning, Kacey.
I just figured out who you are.
You're a fireman.
Mmm-hmm.
No?
Come on.
You know absolutely everything about me.
Well, that's because you talk a lot.
Gordon, this is Agent Bering, with the Secret Service.
Gordon Letanik?
And what's this?
An Aztec blood stone.
The boss of virgin sacrifices.
Handsome devil.
I'm just cleaning him for the reception tonight.
Agent Bering wants the Group D artifacts moved to the west wall.
They're blocking an exit.
Lose Tuvalu and Malta, move Britain to the back.
If it still doesn't fit, see me and we'll cut something else.
Yes, sir.
I'll just finish up.
What's next?
The main floor bathrooms.
I'll need the plumbing pulled again.
Ow!
I would try to sneak you in, but the Secret Service will be there and they can be jerks.
So I've heard.
Call you soon.
You promise?
Promise.
Bye now.
Bye.
Champagne?
Thank you.
Champagne?
Status check on Eagle.
Who's on Emerald entrance?
Me, Morris.
Why aren't you at Emerald?
Well, because I'm here.
How's home base?
We're calling home base "Magenta."
Well, I'm not.
You changed the protocol.
I tweaked it.
I wrote it.
And I didn't use colors.
Why weren't you at my briefing?
I was vetting one of the servers.
Screwing off is more like it.
Well, you say potato.
Get back to Emerald.
You're not my superior.
Dickinson gave this to me.
I'm running it.
Meeka.
Myka.
Myka.
Myka.
Myka.
Mmm-hmm.
I get vibes.
Sorry?
This isn't some run and gun that you're used to in Denver.
Get to the point, Lattimer.
Dickinson gave you this shindig with my protocol because my specialty is logistics, framing.
And I kid you not, there is something really off in here.
Eagle at Magenta.
Mr. President, wait a moment, please.
This is Bering, Eagle is free to enter.
Negative, negative.
This is Lattimer.
Hold Eagle at five until further.
Copy?
Copy that.
Holding Eagle.
Get back to Emerald.
Look, Myka, why don't you pull your head out of your "Magenta" and feel the room?
Something's off.
Listen, Showboat.
Nothing's off.
The room is fine.
Everything is fine.
Now take your vibe and go.
Enjoy your party.
I will.
I want a perimeter check ASAP.
Emerald clear.
Peach clear.
- Orange clear.
- Gold clear.
Crimson clear.
Blood.
Pete?
What are you doing here?
Working.
Is there a fire?
Mmm-mmm.
Excuse me, sir.
Wait just a second.
Secret Service.
This is...
Gotta go.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
That's an okay for Eagle to enter.
Affirmative.
Clear Eagle.
Freeze!
Drop the knife.
Hold your fire!
Seriously, Gordon, drop the knife.
Drop that.
Whatever it is.
Can't do that, Pete.
Weapon.
We're done here.
Hey!
Tell me you found the guy.
The guy you said stole the rock?
We're gonna need a sample.
Come on, Dickinson.
Well, you said, among many strange things, that the rock was bleeding.
It was.
Taxpayers will probably wanna know if you were high, paranoid, or just part of an Aztec art theft ring.
In the meantime, you're suspended, with pay, for two weeks till we get this thing worked out.
What about Morris?
He says nothing happened at Emerald.
Okay, can we stop with the colors already?
What about the guy with the knife?
What?
Letanik?
Yes.
He's in a coma.
Docs don't know why or how long that's gonna last.
And Bering?
Myka's being thanked personally by the President and the First Lady.
Of course she is.
She's going places.
You, on the other hand, you're going to the bathroom.
That's funny.
Ha, ha.
Mr. Lattimer.
My name's Frederic.
Frederic what?
Mrs. Frederic.
Well, that's a relief.
I'm with the government.
I'm here on a matter of national security.
What's that?
An invitation to endless wonder.
Okay, could you sound a little more creepy?
Read it.
Please note the action code.
It is legitimate.
You're part of my bailiwick now.
Your bailiwick?
You're working for me.
For you?
Am I stuttering?
No, ma'am.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
All right, I get it.
I get it.
This is a joke, right?
Dickinson put you guys up.
This is Dickinson being funny, right?
Do I look like a joke, Mr. Lattimer?
No.
You're to be in South Dakota at those coordinates, at noon tomorrow.
You will mention our meeting and your pending assignment to no one.
Is that understood?
How long am I gonna be in South Dakota?
Indefinitely.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, look.
I've got a life here.
Really?
Yeah.
I've got
things.
Pack light, Mr. Lattimer.
We'll ship what you need and store the rest.
Prepare to turn right in 100 feet.
Turn right now.
You have missed your turn.
Go back.
Stop.
Turn right.
Destination straight ahead.
You've got to be kidding me.
Yeah.
Endless wonder.
Hello!
It's Agent Lattimer.
I'm here!
Hello!
Oh, great.
I heard you were suspended.
Yeah, I heard that, too.
Why are you here?
I was ordered here last night.
Mrs. Frederic.
Yes.
Yeah.
Said it was a matter of national security.
National security.
Right.
How are you guys doing?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to fix the fish.
Hey, stop right there.
What are you doing?
This is the guy.
The one from last night.
The guy who stole the rock.
You stole the rock.
It's a blood stone.
It's safe.
It's inside the building.
Yeah, well, it's the property of the museum.
And that museum is property of the U. S. Government.
And so is the Warehouse.
And so am I.
Secret Service.
I also work for Mrs. Frederic.
Arthur Nielsen.
You can call me Artie.
Got some ID?
No.
We take the Secret part seriously around here.
Oh, I just wanted to thank you for your assistance in last night's retrieval.
That was very good.
Hey, did you throw that football at me?
You weren't here when I threw it.
It takes a while to circle back.
Come on inside.
I'll show you around.
Around what?
What am I doing here?
I'll explain everything inside.
Come on.
I made cookies.
Ooh!
Yeah, come on.
Come on.
Really, it's okay.
Go inside.
Don't go far!
Okay, come on in.
Wait for me at the bottom of the stairs.
Go, go, go.
It's fine.
Don't touch anything.
Don't touch the bombs.
Hold this.
Hold it.
Come on.
It's okay.
Right this way.
Miss Bering, Mr. Lattimer, welcome to Warehouse 13.
I'm thrilled you're on the team.
What team?
What is this place?
Officially, K39ZZZ, on the North American grid.
But I like to think of it as America's attic.
Pete, close the door.
Tell me exactly what I'm doing here.
Exactly?
That's a little...
Yeah.
Well, to put it plainly, you're both joining me as fellow gatherers and protectors of secrets.
Put it plainer.
This warehouse...
Look, the Warehouse needs you.
Pete, don't touch.
It needs your combined talents.
I mean, he's intuitive, and you've got a scrupulous eye for detail.
He's scattershot, see?
You're meticulous.
You look, he leaps.
There's been a mistake.
I'm too valuable to be wasted here.
No offense.
Of course not.
Can I use your phone, please?
Mine?
It's broken.
Well, I have to make a phone call, so...
There's no signal here.
Just pull the door, and you'll be...
Now.
There you go.
I think she had other plans.
So did I.
You want juice or are you a milk person?
You know what I'd really like?
Oh, I do indeed, but falling off the wagon may not be the best option at this point.
Milk it is.
Yeah.
That's Mrs. Frederic.
Long time ago.
She looks exactly the same.
Odd, isn't it?
You don't want a cookie?
Yeah.
Okay, so who are these guys?
Former colleagues.
And where are they now?
Well, this one and this one are dead.
This one, a mental institution in Germany.
And this last one, disappeared.
One day I'll find him.
Ted, these are two of my best agents.
How can you not know?
I'm looking at the order.
You processed it.
How can you not know?
Hold on.
Dickinson.
Sir, it's Myka Bering.
Myka.
Sir, I have a little situation here.
I'm not sure...
Yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I'm looking at the transfer order right now.
The name on here is Frederic.
You're transferred to where?
Where are you?
Well, I'm in South Dakota.
Where?
South Dakota.
What are you doing in South Dakota?
You don't know about this?
No.
Who is Frederic?
Sir?
Sir?
Myka?
Myka?
Who's this Frederic?
Sir!
Yes, yes.
She handed me orders last night to come to a warehouse in South Dakota.
The order code was solid, and Lattimer's here, too.
Look, I'm requesting an immediate stand down and transfer back to D.C.
Myka.
Myka, I can't do that.
This order trumps me.
Hold on and I will get you back here ASAP.
What should I do?
Follow orders.
Those orders, both of you.
And how long will this take?
Sir?
Sir?
Are you there?
That's a pile of crap.
No kidding.
No, I'm not kidding.
You're actually standing in a big pile of cow manure.
Oatmeal Scotchie?
No, thank you.
I don't eat sugar.
Good for you.
Listen, please don't think of this assignment as some sort of punishment.
Can you hold this?
What?
Your presence here is not really a reaction to what happened to you in Denver.
So...
I got a commendation for what happened in Denver.
Yes, you did.
It's time for the nickel tour.
Come on.
The order trumps Dickinson?
The first Warehouse 13 was built in '98.
So we're stuck.
Until he works out a transfer, yes.
1898.
We didn't have a handle on how to store stuff.
It burned down.
Some remodeling and excavations were necessary as the years went on to accommodate the arrival of more and more and more and more artifacts.
What's stored here exactly?
Oh, this and that, bric-a-brac.
Some things along the lines of last night's rock and roll.
I'm talking about the blood stone.
Both hands on the bar, please.
I think I'll survive a crash.
No, that's not a safety bar, it's a conduit.
You and Pete are the power source.
Your combined electrical energy makes this thing move.
It's fine, it's fine.
Look, Thomas Edison built this automobile for Henry Ford as a proof of concept, and it's perfectly safe.
Trust me.
Put your hands on the bar.
Put your hands on the bar.
Thank you.
We need both of you.
Hands on the bar, Myka.
Thank you.
Edison, he wanted Ford to let go of oil.
But Ford, no, no, he stuck with it because it ruined his engines faster.
People had to keep buying them.
What is that?
What?
Oh!
That is Training Flight 22.
We pulled that from the Bermuda Triangle.
The Triangle has been trying to pull it back ever since.
Duck and cover.
Ow.
It's harmless.
Inventory kicks up a little static from time to time.
Why are you grinning?
Well, don't you think this stuff is kind of cool?
What?
Where is he?
I don't know.
He'll be back.
Artie!
Hello?
We should stick together.
Right this way, please.
Pete.
Many of the items in here, kind of like the blood stone,
Pete, that you wrestled with last night.
They channel a tangential energy, well...
Tangential energy is kind of like the energy that forced the museum employee last night into...
Well, into almost committing murder.
So how does that happen?
Yeah, we're not really exactly sure how.
It goes back to Einstein, or E equals...
Yeah, okay.
Somehow the matter that is in here has just enough energy to move other matter.
You know, like you.
Move me where?
Into trouble.
Bunk.
Is gravity bunk?
Magnetism?
These are mysterious forces, that we live with every day, but we can't explain them.
Can you even explain to me how a radio works?
Huh?
No.
And you don't really care, as long as you get the traffic report, right?
But if a radio landed in the hands of Thomas Jefferson, you know what Jefferson would do?
He would just lock it up.
Until he figured out it wasn't gonna kill him.
And that is exactly what we do here.
We take the unexplained
And we just safely tuck it away in this supersized Pandora's box.
Metaphorically speaking.
Well, actually, Pandora's box is over in aisle 989 B.
Empty, of course.
Pete, do the world a favor and clear your mind.
Well, that should be easy.
Whoa!
Wow.
How did that get there?
Because I didn't pick that thing up.
It still amazes me how that thing moves.
What?
What?
What is it?
Don't talk, don't hope, don't wish for anything.
That kettle grants wishes?
Yes.
Now, Pete, look at me.
Just keep your eyes on me.
Okay.
Open it.
Pete!
Pete.
This is a neutralizer.
You can think of this as a fire extinguisher for objects that "act up."
Now, look, I want you to come over here,
I want you to drop that very slowly, right in here.
Now, listen, there are items around here, if you were to put it in there, they would generate a big flash, but this little thing will probably be a little spark.
But you may flinch, and I don't want you to, 'cause you could drop it.
Okay?
Well, I have a wish.
Don't!
You wished for a ferret?
No.
That was already in the thing.
I don't think so.
You wished for a transfer, didn't you?
Mmm.
Impossible wishes, wishes that can never be granted, they produce a ferret.
Don't ask me why.
My first year here, the whole place was crawling with ferrets.
I swear, I didn't pick that thing up.
No, I know, I know.
Not everybody is affected by everything.
Here, okay?
You have to be metaphysically predisposed.
And the external energies, they have to be in alignment.
This is just a convergence thing.
Right, sure, okay.
So we're all converged here, but I still have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
What you're supposed to do is hunt down whatever is threatening to ruin the world's day, neutralize it and bring it here.
You gotta snag it and bag it and tag it.
This is crazy!
This is crazy!
You know, I don't...
It could be, you know, crazy fun.
That's exactly the attitude that brought you to our attention.
Do you guys want a cookie for the road?
What road?
There's rooms for you at Leena's Bed Breakfast.
It's about seven miles down the road that way, and I'll join you there in the morning, and I'II...
I'll just join you there in the morning.
Stay close!
Seriously, Lattimer, there's been a serious screw-up.
I'm serious.
And now you have a ferret.
What?
This town, is this a town or what?
What's the name of it?
Well, it's more like a street.
So it says here to turn left at Buffalo Station.
What?
No, no, no.
It's "Buffalo Statue."
It says "Buffalo Statue."
Well, your penmanship is atrocious.
I don't need wise...
You know, that's...
You know, don't do that.
Can you finish a sentence?
A full thought?
Would you really like me to?
Wait.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
No, no, no.
Don't call Dickinson.
He hates being pestered.
I don't pester.
Well, when he knows something, he'll call.
Clearly the phrase "rolling with the punches" is not in your vocabulary, so may I make a suggestion?
What might that be?
Unbunch your panties, and make the best of a bad situation.
And how do I do that?
Which part?
You're a freak.
Hello.
I'm Leena.
You must be Pete and Myka.
Come in.
I've got your rooms ready.
We serve three meals, 9:00, noon, and 5:00.
We've got radios in the rooms.
No TVs.
No in-room phones, but there is one there at the bottom of the stairs in the hallway.
You may choose any room.
Is there anywhere I can get a drink?
I mean, a drink drink?
What would you like?
Whiskey neat.
I can do that.
Please do that.
She hates traveling.
She loves traveling.
It's the places she's traveled to that's the problem.
Ah.
Can I get you anything?
No, I'm fine.
Yep, yep.
Is everything okay?
You're a lucky man, Pete.
I am?
You're in tune.
Very rare.
I don't know what that...
Look, Leena, are you connected to Artie?
Let me know if your bed is big enough for you.
Hey, Bunny.
How'd it go today?
Not bad.
Lattimer seems interested.
And Miss Bering, not so much.
Mmm.
Did you select a case for them?
Yeah.
Listen, I don't mean any disrespect, but are we really sure that these are the people?
The right people?
Because...
Artie.
I'm fully aware of their baggage.
Now, what's the real problem?
Artie, take yourself off the hook.
Their fate falls on me.
You say that...
Dickinson wants them back.
You've got to get them locked in.
Can't sleep?
Yeah.
Me neither.
We don't have to talk.
So...
Do you always eat when you're stressed?
Do you always talk this much?
You know, no light from the city to get in the way.
Nothing but sky.
This time of the year, we get Leo,
Cygnus, Sagittarius.
You know this how?
My dad and I used to camp a lot.
Where is he now?
Sorry.
What about your folks?
Colorado Springs.
They own a bookstore called Bering Sons.
How many brothers?
No brothers.
Just me.
My dad thought the "and Sons" sounded classier.
Well, he must be proud of you.
Mom is.
Well, did protecting the President of the United States turn him around?
Yeah.
This won't.
From Denver to D.C. To a warehouse security guard in six months.
Now, there's a career trajectory.
Look, about Denver,
I didn't mean to spit on that last night.
What you did there was better than textbook.
We're not discussing that.
Ever.
All right, well, I'm gonna go back upstairs and not sleep some more.
Hey.
Earlier, did you hear a...
Hear what?
Never mind.
Dickinson will call.
He better.
Location, time, Seever City.
Come on.
So it's gonna be you, then.
Okay, Cody Thomas, a law school grad student, University of Southern Iowa.
Iowa?
Yeah, Iowa.
His parents were killed in a plane crash.
He is a really good kid.
He's been putting himself through college with the settlement.
Why are we going to Iowa?
To find whatever it is that pushed this kid over the edge.
What edge?
He struck his girlfriend.
That's it?
So far.
Look, for the past five days, I have been reviewing 11 possible cases, looking for whatever doesn't fit.
Something out of place, like blood on a marble floor that leads to a man with a knife because of a rock that isn't just a rock.
I've got a hunch that this is the one.
What exactly are we looking for?
Well, you tell me.
It's bigger than a breadbox.
Or smaller.
If there is an artifact at the heart of this, then I've prepared a few questions for Cody that might reveal it.
Actually, it's more than a few questions, but...
"Do you have the constant feeling that today is yesterday?"
Okay, yeah.
See, if they say yes, then we could...
They probably won't say yes.
It's unlikely.
But we could be dealing with time slip.
Or a hangover.
Please take this seriously.
I had a run-in with a Mayan calendar a few years ago, and that question saved my life, and the two agents that were with me were not quite so lucky.
What happened to them?
Their clocks stopped.
So, what?
They died?
Well, they'll wish they had in 100 years or so.
Anyway...
Neutralizer.
The purple stuff.
If you find the artifact, just drown it in there, like this, if you can.
And if it's too big, you just take this and throw it, and then call me.
And don't ask me how it works, because I have no idea.
And it doesn't always work.
And don't ingest that stuff, because you'II...
You'll see things.
And we'll stay in contact with these.
I have one just like it.
Two-way video communication?
I call it a Farnsworth.
It's named after Philo Farnsworth, who invented that in 1929, right after he invented the television.
Isn't that remarkable?
I mean, anyway, if you want to talk to me, just press that button.
What is that?
Nikola Tesla,
Thomas Edison's chief rival or nemesis, depending...
He cooked this up as an alternative to bullets.
It's really a kind of electric stun gun.
It's a polyphase ass-kicker.
Now, that's...
Yeah.
Just here.
Just don't put it past two to begin with.
That's the trigger, right there.
You should practice with it first.
One blast and down you go.
Don't point that at me.
Keep your finger away.
Just don't.
Stop.
Give him the gun.
And also, it zaps short-term memory, which is why Agent Morris doesn't remember seeing me at the museum.
And that's it.
That's what?
Go to Iowa.
Talk to Cody.
Find the artifact if it exists.
Neutralize it, bring it back.
Oh, and don't get killed.
How's her aura?
Tortured.
Guilt and grief, mostly.
She has a soft spot for the ferret, though.
Just like you.
Now, that was a long time ago.
Hmm.
You haven't changed that much.
She had a stowaway.
I found this in her room.
Oh, Lord.
That's Houdini's wallet.
Fingers!
Okay.
That was a bad spike.
That landed on something with her.
I requisitioned mesh screens for those shelves ten years ago.
And every year since.
I've told you this.
A few times.
You'd think Mrs. Frederic could maybe get that done.
Don't look at me.
Well, I had the FBI in here a while ago on a suspected terrorist thing.
All egos out to here and all looking like they're wearing daddy's suit.
Well, we feel the same way.
Ah, just let me know if this thing's going federal so I can get my staff prepared for the media.
It's not going federal.
We just have a few questions and then we're gone.
It's Dickinson.
Oh.
It'll just be a sec.
Yeah, this is Bering.
Myka, how you doing?
Well, we're in Iowa now, on assignment.
Any luck in getting us back?
Bad news is, not so far.
Good news is, I've got a line on this Frederic woman.
She worked for the Treasury Department in the 1950s, after that...
Well, it's not the same woman.
The woman we met was younger.
I've got a Frederic in charge of some sort of secret sandbox.
It's being funded from a black ops budget I'm still trying to source.
Well, I can fill you in.
No, no, no.
These lines aren't secure.
Listen to me.
I'm doing everything I can to get you and Pete back here. 48 hours, tops.
So just follow your current orders and keep your head down.
Wait, sir!
Sir?
So, how'd he sound?
Forty-eight hours.
Yeah, but how'd he sound?
Not good.
What kind of questions?
They're sort of diagnostic.
Diagnostic.
What, like I'm sick?
You're Secret Service doctors?
No.
Question number one.
"Have you recently encountered something that you feel has affected your life?"
Something like what?
An object of some kind.
Do handcuffs count?
No.
Question number two.
"While looking up, do you have the sensation of falling?"
Cody?
No.
I don't feel like I'm falling.
Next question.
Okay, question number three.
"Have you recently smelled something that could best be described as
"fudge when there is no fudge?"
Fudge?
Is that...
Question four. "Do you ever feel like this might be a colossal waste of time?"
Okay, let's...
Yeah.
Okay.
We're done with those questions, Cody.
Yes.
What do you think happened with your girlfriend?
What's her name?
I don't know.
Emily.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
I was in class, talking to the professor about some mock trial thing.
I woke up here, and they told me I beat Emily up.
They let you see a doctor?
Yeah.
Says I'm fine.
And no...
No alcohol or drugs?
No, I swear.
No history of blackouts?
No.
This isn't me.
I would never hurt Emily.
This isn't me.
This isn't...
Cody?
Get him out of here!
Right, let's go.
We got him, sir.
Let's get him down to secure lockup.
Let's go.
Well, that was scary.
You don't need to worry about anything.
I'm gonna take care of it.
Just hang in there.
I'm gonna get you out of here soon.
Can you come this way, son?
Hello.
I'm Lorna Soliday.
I'm Cody's lawyer.
And did Travis call you?
Sheriff Travis respects the law, and he doesn't like being railroaded by federal agents.
Are you that hands-on with all your clients?
No.
Just my godson.
So you knew his parents.
Very well.
And neither Cody nor I will be answering any more questions until I know what this is about.
We're interested in Cody's behavior.
His violent behavior.
As in, where's it coming from?
What is this?
Someone pegged him as a threat to the President?
Not yet.
Not ever.
That's not Cody.
It was Cody that just destroyed that table in there.
Not to mention what he did to his girlfriend.
Does the Secret Service investigate every case of battery among college students?
Nope.
Just this one.
So where'd the Italian come in?
What do you mean?
He spoke Italian in there, just before he decided that the interview was over.
I don't know anything about that.
Well, has Cody come into contact with anything unusual, say, in the past few days?
Yes.
You two.
That was a serious question.
That was a serious answer.
Any more questions, Sheriff Travis has my number.
You felt that, right?
I'm not sure what you mean.
It got hot.
Yeah.
But you knew to get me to the floor before he freaked out.
The vibe.
Right.
Okay, so how do those things work?
Is there false alarms or...
It happens all the time.
So why do you trust them?
Well...
One time I didn't, and I should have.
You're right.
It's Italian, sort of.
I mean, this is either part gibberish.
I don't know.
It's some kind of code, maybe.
And my software can barely translate any of this.
I mean, "dolore" means "pain."
And a tech search came up with nothing.
There's no films, no books, no plays, no songs, no poems.
Okay, so what now?
Well, you're right beside a college campus.
You can go find somebody who speaks Italian.
Artie.
Hello?
Hello?
Excuse me.
Professor Marzotto?
Yes.
We're with the Secret Service.
Oh, my.
It's an old construction.
15th century.
It's not working-class Italian either.
This is high brow.
So what's he saying?
Roughly?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they'd be able to understand my pain."
Do you visit Italy a lot?
I haven't been back in nearly two years.
But you're sure this translation is correct.
I'm a Renaissance scholar.
I'm sure.
Oh!
One last question.
Do you know a student here named Cody Thomas?
I know of him.
I read about him in the paper.
It's a sad story, that.
How so?
Well, you know.
He was a good kid.
From what I heard, he had some sort of a breakdown.
All right.
Well, if we need you to translate anything else...
I'd be more than happy to help.
You can reach me at that number.
Great.
Thank you.
He's hiding something.
Did you see his neck pulse?
Bang, bang, bang.
Don't you have a scrupulous eye for detail.
And he shelves his books alphabetically.
I didn't notice that.
He puts pens in one cup, pencils in another.
Okay.
Now you're scaring me.
Did you see where he put his pen right before we left?
Was Sherlock Holmes a big deal at your parents' bookstore?
Something got Marzotto going.
And you.
I don't like being lied to.
I'll remember that.
So what, you want to go back and hit him again?
No, I want a hard phone line.
I thought this was a colossal waste of time.
Not anymore.
Hey, hold up.
Do you always walk so fast?
Yes, I do.
Are you coming?
Harris.
I have an incoming code Madrid for Minnie Harris.
Reply 6955.
Hi, Minnie.
Hey, hotshot.
Hey, how's the White House?
You know, it's a lot smaller than it looks on TV.
How are you?
Chad and I are dating.
Very nice.
Yes, it is.
Look, I need some information.
Okay, shoot.
Edward Marzotto.
One "Z" two "T's."
He's a professor at Southern Iowa University.
Turnaround?
I need it now.
Sorry, I know this is big.
It's not a problem.
You okay to hang on and I'll give you the highlights?
For sure.
Okay, thanks.
Hang on.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Government agents are asking me lots of questions I can't answer without getting you and me into a lot of trouble.
It's about the book.
Your boyfriend is quoting from it.
How's Myka?
Edgy, irritable.
You know, Myka.
Why?
Just checking.
Hey, listen, there's something I forgot to mention before.
What?
Just before Cody got physical, there was some kind of a...
I don't know, a heat wave.
It just rolled right off of him.
This happen after a question?
No, he was talking about his girlfriend, Emily Krueger.
You talked to her, right?
No, not yet.
All right.
Listen.
I'm gonna check out that heat thing.
I'm gonna see if that relates to anything.
And meanwhile, what was that translation?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
Hello?
Artie.
Hey.
Do you want me to...
Do you want me to run that again?
I got it.
Okay, Pete, you're positive that's the translation?
Absolutely positive?
Yeah, I mean, that's what Marzotto said.
Okay, I'll call you back.
Okay.
Myka?
Got some good stuff.
Yeah.
Edward Melville Marzotto.
Melville?
Yeah, I know.
Anyway, the man loves his Italian art.
Just got back from Italy eight weeks ago, and the cops think...
Minnie?
Hey, Bunny.
Hey.
Slow down.
Walk faster.
So what'd you find out?
Hey, what happened in there?
Myka, hey.
Tell me.
I heard a...
I thought I heard a voice over the phone that I really should not be hearing.
Same thing you heard at Leena's.
Look, sometimes we hear things and see things that aren't there.
What I heard can't be there.
It can't be.
Then it's not.
I mean, maybe it's post-traumatic stress.
I read the press release of what went down in Denver.
Lives were saved.
Lives were lost.
You're a hero.
You're gonna put me on a psych eval, aren't you?
Why would I do that?
Because you need to be able to depend on your partner.
All right.
Well, then, you're just gonna have to depend on me to know that you're okay.
We're gonna finish this case, we're gonna get out of here.
We will.
I don't know if I can.
I don't even know what we're looking for.
Yes, you do.
I mean, whatever doesn't fit.
You know, something that's out of place.
Marzotto.
Marzotto lied to us.
He said that the last time he was in Italy was...
Two years ago.
Yeah, my contact told me it was eight weeks ago.
How about that?
I wonder what else he lied about.
I guess we need more information.
Yes, we do.
Cody's girlfriend.
Emily Krueger.
I need a picture!
Just give me a picture!
Give me a picture.
Don't make me come down there!
All right.
I know this is awkward.
And I feel terrible, but...
You can't keep it.
I don't know what I was thinking even taking it out of Italy, but it has to go back.
I'm going to Rome next week.
And that's coming with me.
What's that for?
I hate this part.
Ow!
Emily, you're late.
Sorry.
We were setting up for the party.
Can I help you?
Emily Krueger?
Yes.
I know your pain, trust me.
Okay.
Oh!
We saw you leaving Professor Marzotto's office, didn't we?
Oh.
Right.
I was there for a meeting for the play.
I'm in it.
Marzotto's sort of a technical advisor.
Does he know about your relationship with Cody?
He knows what happened.
Why?
Huh.
Because when we talked to him about Cody, he didn't mention you.
Or that you'd just been to see him.
Maybe he was trying to protect my privacy.
Why did you guys mention Cody?
We needed something translated.
Yeah, have you ever heard Cody speak Italian?
Just once, when he did this.
How long have you known Cody?
Since the eighth grade.
Got serious after his parents died.
I came here for theater.
He applied for law school.
His godmother helped him get in.
Lorna Soliday?
You met her?
Does she have any family?
Just Cody.
And that's not even real family.
She made sure that he got that big settlement when his parents died.
Stop.
Do you know what it means?
"If people knew the reasons for my fear,
"they would be able to understand my pain."
Does that mean anything to you?
Only that he's afraid of abandonment and it scares him.
Maybe he thought that I was spending too much time on the play.
I don't know.
Can I go back to work now?
Yes.
Ten to one, this has nothing to do with the hocus pocus Artie's pushing.
How about a billion to one?
How about a cute girl in a play by Machiavelli makes her insecure boyfriend freak out?
Or try this.
Emily, an actress, is a ruthless gold digger.
She'd know which buttons to push on her insecure boyfriend to get him mad enough to hit her.
Right?
She goes for the money.
Sues him for it.
What kind of women do you date?
Pete?
Pete!
Pete.
Pete.
It's Marzotto.
What?
The attendant said he heard him speaking Italian before he doused himself.
Hey.
Hey!
Hold on.
Why'd you talk to Marzotto?
Who told you that?
Secret Service hits campus, and people notice.
And now he's dead.
Before this, you said something to make Cody Thomas want to knock your heads off.
Something you want to tell me?
We should talk about this later.
All right, let me tell you something...
Sure.
Tell me something that makes it seem like I couldn't kick your ass in front of your men.
Boys, boys, can we put our badges back in our pants, please?
Sheriff.
What was that?
We gotta get to Marzotto's office.
Yeah, and how are we gonna get in?
Hotshot.
What the hell is Warehouse 13?
We haven't met.
I'm Mrs. Frederic.
How'd you get in here?
Through a door.
Warehouse 13, is it yours?
It's mine.
And so are Lattimer and Bering.
Excuse me?
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
Never mind.
The vibe thing?
My dad was a fireman.
When I was 12,
I got this feeling one morning that I was never gonna see him again.
You didn't say anything?
I didn't want him to see how scared I was.
He died that night in a house fire, saving a couple of kids.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
So now when you get a feeling...
Yeah.
He got his pen out of his pencil cup.
Well, at least he died happy.
Not funny.
You're right.
Well, that's strange.
What?
The M's are out of order.
Hey, there's something in there.
Is this it?
I don't know.
What if it is?
Then we're done.
So open it.
You open it.
I don't want another ferret or whatever.
Don't.
Just in case.
What's that?
Something's missing.
Let's call Artie.
Yeah.
Miss Soliday.
What are you doing here?
You heard what happened to Marzotto?
Yes, Sheriff Travis just called.
Now, get out before I call him back and tell him you're searching this office without a warrant.
We're here investigating his suicide.
Ed didn't kill himself.
He had help.
What do you mean?
Somebody broke his heart.
We were together for three years.
And then we weren't.
I thought we were in love, but things change, and he chose someone else.
A student?
Did Emily Krueger break his heart?
And Cody's.
She's a despicable young woman who uses people to get what she wants, and then when she's done using them...
We're looking for something, something about this big.
We think Marzotto had it, but now it's missing.
Did Emily get it, you know, whatever it is?
Why don't you ask her?
She's helping with the party for the play.
Cody's there.
Cody's out?
Emily dropped the charges.
Okay, we should go.
I'm coming with you.
If you're confronting Emily, I need to be there for Cody.
Let's go.
I gotta lose weight.
Miss Soliday.
Yes?
Do you think Emily would ever hurt Cody?
Not physically.
Even if she tried, she couldn't.
And why not?
Me.
Cody has me.
I made a promise to his parents when I became his godmother that I would always be there to protect him.
It's only a matter of time before Cody realizes Emily's just small-town trash.
Cody is destined for great things, and I'm helping him succeed.
With me, he can do anything or be anyone he wants.
Myka.
Yeah.
Could you pull over for a sec?
Yeah.
Stop right there!
Hey.
Hi, Myka.
I know you.
Well, that's a good sign.
Where am I?
Hospital in Iowa, Seever City.
What happened?
Car accident.
You've been out for two days.
Pete.
How's Pete?
Lattimer's still unconscious.
We don't know.
Myka, there's someone here to see you.
Someone who's gonna help you get back to where you belong.
The President?
Better.
Hey, Bunny.
Hey.
You know you shouldn't be here, right?
I could say the same thing about you.
I think you just did.
I'm hurt.
That didn't stop you in Denver.
I was late.
No, Bunny.
I was early.
I jumped the gun.
You're dead, Sam.
Hey, Bunny, you need to get up now.
You got a lot of things you need to do.
Get up.
Bunny, you have to get up now.
Get up.
Myka, get up.
Pete!
Oh!
Pete!
Lattimer!
Pete!
Wake up, buddy.
Can you hear me?
Come on.
Here we go.
Okay.
All right.
Wait, wait, wait.
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
You're giving me a wedgie.
What?
Yeah.
Okay.
Just...
You okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
Sit here and don't move.
I'm just gonna get the book.
If you find a badge, it's mine.
Never mind.
I found it.
You okay?
Yeah.
Soliday crashed the car.
You think?
Where is she?
She's not here.
She had some kind of jewelry in her hair, like a comb thing.
It looked old, like it would fit in the book.
Pete, you're bleeding.
I'm fine.
Pete.
I'm fine.
Here, answer that.
Yeah?
You're looking for jewelry.
This thing.
Yeah, we know.
We just saw it in a woman's hair.
She tried to kill us.
A woman?
What woman?
Her name is Lorna Soliday.
She's...
Part of the ruling class, single, successful, she's middle-aged.
She's a survivor of family tragedies and the death of loved ones.
She's connected somehow to a young man, a young man that she believes needs her protection?
He's good, yeah.
Pretty good.
Yeah.
What's the matter with you two?
You two all right?
Okay, anyway, look.
This comb is transmitting Lucrezia Borgia.
Lucrezia who?
Borgia.
She's a cutthroat Italian who ruled Italy in the 1600s with her father and brothers.
My family owned a bookstore, remember?
That's right.
That's right.
So what do you mean "the comb's transmitting"?
An alchemist made it, okay?
Out of what, I don't know.
It's supposed to be some kind of Renaissance roofie.
Somehow the crystals in the ionized metal in this thing are affecting brain chemistry.
What about the phrase?
Yeah, the phrase.
Okay.
That's like some kind of phonetic trigger.
This is a very, very, very unhappy woman.
Very unlucky in love.
There's supposed to be a jewelry box.
We found it in Marzotto's office.
He must have given Soliday the comb.
Like her, she wants love at any cost.
She wants love, and she is gonna kill to get it.
Okay, she wants Cody, so she wants Emily gone.
And Emily's at the party.
What are you talking about a party?
What party?
Oh, God.
Some Renaissance blowout for some Machiavelli play.
Machiavelli?
This woman's gonna be there?
Yes.
You've gotta stop this woman.
Lucrezia Borgia, 600 years ago, started a bloody reign of terror, and this comb is gonna wanna start it all over again.
It's got twisted desires, and it'll amplify, it'll spread like some kind of orgiastic virus.
First to Iowa, then to Nebraska, then to Illinois.
We understand.
Probably first to Illinois and then...
Okay, look, we need to get you to a hospital first...
No, no, no, no, no.
Pete.
No, look, I'm trained to take a bullet if necessary.
But I'm not sure how to stop a dead Italian cougar.
We need some kind of approach.
I have no more color-coded plans.
There's a silver lining.
Okay, I'll go in, grab Cody.
You flank.
No, you flank.
Trust me.
Okay.
Okay.
That's not creepy.
How you doing?
Ooh.
That's nice.
Cody!
Cody.
Come on, man, you don't wanna do this.
Okay.
Look.
Hey, hey.
Hey, you don't wanna hurt her.
Okay.
Just let Emily go.
Oh, he intends to.
Her dying scream will be the trigger...
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, nobody's screaming, okay?
We're gonna take a deep breath, we're all gonna come back down to Earth.
Cute.
Cody.
Kid's fast.
What's your pain, Lorna?
What are you afraid of?
You know.
And so does she.
Show's over.
Drop the comb thing.
Did you really let your lover die?
Myka.
Shut up.
For a chance at glory?
I said shut up.
Don't look at it, Myka.
Myka!
Yeah, sorry.
No one's dying here tonight.
But you might lose a tooth.
Pete!
Duck and cover?
What did I do?
It's okay.
It's over.
Love hurts, I know.
So here's the deal.
You got a choice.
You can come back to D.C. , or you can stay with the new assignment.
What's the catch?
I only get you.
Lattimer has to stay there.
And if I stay, what happens to Pete?
He still stays.
How long do I have to think about it?
About five more seconds.
Four, three, two.
Radius...
Mm-hmm.
Ulna...
Mm-hmm.
Olecranon...
It's like dating a french guy.
Bonjour.
It's latin, and by the way, we are way past dating.
Mm.
That's why I'm going wedding dress shopping with Kitty today.
With Kitty?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I helped her find her dress.
I figured we could be each other's good luck charms
In the dress department.
Mm.
Oh, that's sweet.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Can I tell you my fantasy?
No, I won't be a slutty bride.
Damn it.
Well, maybe you can just buy a dress that shows your...
Yes?
Humerus...
Your acromion...
Mm.
And your... mm...
Cheek.
You don't know the medical term for cheekbone?
Oh, you know what?
You are shattering a guy's confidence
On the first day of gross anatomy.
Me on.
Nothing ever happens on the first day anyways.
You get your textbooks and the syllabus.
Yeah, and apparently a lab partner.
It better not be a hot girl.
I just hope it's not someone stupid who doesn't know what he's doing.
Mm, seems like you're getting your confidence back.
Mm.
Now where were we...
Doctor?
Doctor?
I have a real good feeling about this, Kitty.
Hey, guys.
Whatever happens, I'm sorry about the wait.Th it.
You know, you can go right ahead and... and tell me.
I need to talk to you about your CT scan.
Oh.
Now thankfully, your bone marrow is clean, but this bright area here is an enlarged lymph node in the hila of your lung.
There's another cluster in your bowel, and there's some more in your retroperitoneum... that's the area behind your abdominal cavity.
So... s... so it's spread.
Yeah, unfortunately, which, um, puts it at stage III.
Look, I know that this sounds scary, but compared to other cancers, stage III lymphoma can have a good outcome with proper treatment.
What is the proper treatment?
Well, there are basically two options.
Um, one... the standard of care, is r-chop.
That's a chemotherapy cocktail.
And what's the other option?
Well, there's a drug that was developed in Europe called rapamycin.
Um, a hospital in Boston is conducting clinical trials, and Kitty may be eligible.
But you have to go there for treatment, and it could last six months.
Now they are showing a somewhat better prognosis, but the risks of complications are also higher.
Um, heart damage, it could jeopardize your immune system, which would already be compromised by the chemo.
I wish that there was a clear-cut choice, but there are pros and cons to both.
I only do the standard regimen.
Because you think it's a better treatment?
No, because she practices here, and the... the... the trial's in Boston.
You know what?
Why don't I give you the research?
You can take it home, read it over and then you can discuss your options.
Okay?
But, um, I have to stress, Kitty,
That the sooner you make a decision, the better.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Travis, I don't care that you work for governor kern.
You know the protocol.
The senator's the ranking official when it comes to greeting international guests.
Nice try, but the governor of California is gonna be
At the bottom of those stairs ahen the Prince of Wales sets his pretty royal toe on California soil.
Really?
Well, then I'd hate to see your face when his royal highness walks straight past her and says hi to the senator because they played golf together in Scotland.
I didn't know you had a baby.
You know, maybe... maybe we can, uh, you know, set up... something with the prince at the hotel, like a photo-op.
Do I need to call 9-1-1?
I think he's hungry.
Or maybe he's just wet.
Scotty!
Uh, it's... it's not a baby.
Yeah, well, whatever it is, deal with it.
Look, I'm glad we settled this issue.
Uh, you know what?
We didn't settle any...
What are you doing?
That was important.
You keep insisting we can manage a baby with two careers, so I thought we'd have a little dress rehearsal.
Well, you know what?
Your timing sucks.
I have this visit and two press releases to get out today.
Yeah, well, you know what?
I have tonight's menu to prepare.
And that crying baby?
Someone needs to change his diaper.
Uh-oh.
It's... it's a poopy one.
You made your point.
We'll talk about this later.
Yeah, well, it's always later, Kevin, that's the problem.
Nice balance.
Fruit forward.
A little smoke in the finish, huh?
All done?
Thank you so much.
You're very welcome.
Thank you.
So tell me something...
that's what we're bidding on?
Mm. 10,000 gallons, if the price stays under $5.25 a gallon.
Oh!
$5.25?
Nobody's gonna bid $5.25 for that swill.
Trust me.
You take that swill and you add it to our grapes, and you will get a nice bottle of wine.
Oh, holly, that's short-term thinking.
I don't care how cheaply you're gonna sell it.
In the long run, it's gonna ruin our brand.
You know, how many times do I have to tell you,
Saul, that we are gonna market under a fferent label?
What, old flame?
No, just a business acquaintance.
Saul?
I heard a rumor your family had expanded into the wine business.
Yeah, well, how about that?
What about you?
How's the cattle business, hmm?
It runs itself, Saul.
This is my new hobby now.
Great.
You know, at our age, it's good to keep, uh, your mind fresh.
Yeah.
Oh, sorry.
This is Holly Harper.
She's the President of Ojai Foods.
Hi.
And this gentleman is Dennis York.
A woman in charge.
Well, well.
William certainly would have approved.
Sorry to hear of his passing, by the way.
It's a terrible loss.
Your concern is touching, Dennis.
Well, good luck with the bidding.
Nice to meet you, Holly Harper.
Let's do it.
Wow.
This is inspiring.
There is a whole community of people that have been through this, and they're all really positive.
Listen, there's a Febbie Feelwell from Florida, and she says the r-chop was "very doable."
She was diagnoseth stage IV lymphoma, and now she's n.E.D....
No evidence of disease.
Oh, wow.
Look at this.
What?
Look at this.
That's a wedding dress.
Can you imagine how good that would look on Rebecca?
Honey, I thought we were...
We were researching treatment options, Kitty.
Well, we were, but now I'm researching wedding dresses.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Look at this one.
Look at that.
I mean, that almost makes me want to get married again.
It's really beaut...
Honey, you heard the doctor.
You have to make a decision now.
I will, but... but, um, we're going shopping, and I need to help Rebecca find a wedding dress.
All right.
All right.
Well, are you gonna tell her what's going on?
Yes.
Yes, of course, right when she's zipping up her Carolina Herrera.
I know you don't want anyone to know about this yet, Kitty, but everyone here talks about how important it is to have a strong support system.
Mom, you need to get offline.
I will figure this out.
I...
I will make the right decision, and I promise you,
I will be N.E.D. no evidence of disease.
Yes, never enough doughnuts, never enough dresses, never...
I love you.
Mm.
Ha ha!
She went shopping?
Yes.
Look, I...
I understand she...
she needs a distraction, but, Robert, there really isn't time for that.
Do you know what her prognosis is?
55%.
Yeah, with r-chop, but I just got off the phone with the head researcher in Boston, and he says his treatment will give her an extra 5% chance.
Yes, I read the study, but the... but the sample population was only a few hundred patients.
That's really not enough to tell, and the side effects, there's heart damage...
That was a woman who was 65 years old with a history of diabetes and smoked.
Kitty's young and healthy.
Blood clots, it can devastate her immune system.
Now if the r-chop doesn't work or... or she has a relapse...
I'm not waiting for a relapse.
And I don't care what the side effects are as long as she lives.
I just don't think this is right for her at this time, and she'd be 3,000 miles away.
Well, I'd go with her, obviously.
Oh, and... and when would you be there, exactly?
You're running for governor.
Who would take care of Evan?
Her family is here.
I am here.
But if the best treatment is there, then that's where she needs to be.
If I though that were true,
I would be helping her pack right now.
I don't think it's right for her.
Look, she is my wife.
Okay?
We're gonna do whatever's best for both of us.
Oh, no, no.
What, are you gonna play the husband card, Robert?
I don't even know what that means.
Up until recently, you have been completely M.I.A.
What, you're gonna swoop in now and save the day?
Is that it?
I just want her well.
Listen to me, Robert.
I don't care if you're senator or governor or the King of Siam.
You've not shown me that her life is safe in your hands.
You don't get to call the shots.
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
But you are right about one thing...
The only person that's gonna be calling the shots is Kitty.
Yes.
She is.
This is it... gross anatomy.
My name is Professor Madsen, and I'm here to tell you that whatever you told yourself, getting in was not the hard part.
Here, there will be many opportunities to fail... you're not smart enough, the work isn't good enough or you simply can't handle the pressure.
Wow.
Inspirational, isn't he?
There are three people who will determine your fate in this class... one of them is me, yhe other, your cadaver, and the third is your lab partner.
Now in this class, as in life, you don't get to choose your coworkers.
You might not like them, so you have to find a way to work with them.
Okay?
So the next time we'll begin with the upper limb.
Be familiar with it.
So I've drawn up a study schedule for the first half of the year.
Oh, great.
It's, uh, it's color-coded.
By body part.
You've already acquainted yourself with the upper limb, right?
Yeah, uh, the, uh, bones and muscles, I'm good to go.
It's the, uh, tendons and ligaments
I'm a little uneasy... wait, wait.
What?
The majority of arm injuries...
lateral epicondylitis, adhesive capsulitis, inflammatory impingement... all are tendon-related.
But we... we weren't supposed to know those for today, though, right?
No.
You see, I volunteered in an orthopedic lab to help patent a synthetic bone paste.
I mean, you can't expect to know everything I'm gonna know, but you will need to keep up with the basics.
I...
I'm sorry.
How old are you?
16, graduated with honors, and yes, my social maturity has been tested.
I was gonna mine tested tomorrow.
Look, I have us going over the musculature of the torso by early next week.
Is that gonna be a problem?
Uh, no.
No, no.
I'll, uh, I'll...
I'll catch up.
You better, because you heard what he said...
Our fates are tied, and I will be acing this class.
And no doogie howser jokes.
No.
Oh, my gosh.
This is definitely the best one so far.
What... what do you think, Monique?
She looks good in everything.
I don't know about that.
How do you feel about feathers?
Like they belong on birds.
Monique.
Yeah.
The symphony gown with the ostrich skirt...
I got it.
Are you serious?
Kitty, I can't wear a feathered dress.
I'm gonna feel like big bird.
Come on.
You h... you have to at least try it on.
Rebecca, you are the bride.
You have got to embrace your inner princess.
I don't have an inner princess.
You are gonna have to get one.
You are... you are young, and you are beautiful.
Are you drunk?
No.
No, I am not drunk.
I am...
I'm... excited.
Well, can I remind you that when you were getting married,
I couldn't get you to even try on one dress?
Well, I was stupid and I was an idiot.
I mean, look at us, Rebecca.
We are surrounded by tulle and lace and feathers.
I mean, we have to enjoy this.
You never know what's gonna happen tomorrow.
We could all get hit by a bus.
We're not gonna get hit by a bus.
You don't know that.
Things can change in a blink of an eye.
Are you sure you're okay?
Mm-hmm.
I am drinking champagne, and I am watching my beautiful future sister-in-law try on the most gorgeous dresses I have ever seen in my life.
I mean, I am more than okay.
I'm...
I'm great.
I never want to leave.
I mean, I...
I love you, and I...
I honestly...
I could stay in this store forever.
Okay, fine.
I will try on the feathers.
Good idea.
Okay, be careful.
Be careful.
Okay.
Oh.
Hmm.
Our next lot up for bid is 10,000 gallons of a 2008 Cabernet from Vittarelli Estates.
We'll start the bidding today, $2 a gallon.
Do I have 2$?
$2 right here.
Looking for $2.25.
Thank you. $2.25.
Do I have $2.50?
$2.50.
Looking for $2.75.
$2.75.
Do I have $3?
$2.75.
Do I have $3?
$2.75 going once, going twice... $6.
$6.
Going once at $6.
$6 going twice...
We can't go that high.
Sold at $6.
Up next, we have a 2006 Cabernet... who is he and what the hell is he doing?
$1.25.
Looking for $1.50.
Hey.
I already called the state department, told them the senator will be meeting the plane, so you can save your breath.
No, I'm here about Kitty.
I'm sorry, by the way.
Uh, when are you doing the press conference?
What are you talking about?
Look, we know.
Uh, we're telling everyone on the campaign hands off, leave it alone completely.
And if you give us a day, we can have the governor cancel any appearances she has, out of respect.
Out of respect for what?
Look, I'm in this thing to win, but even I wouldn't use a wife's cancer to score points.
Are you...
Oh.
You didn't know?
It's kev.
Oh, hey.
You are not gonna believe what Travis tried to do to me today.
He tried to tell me that you have...
That you're sick, but I mean, like, really sick.
That's... that's insane, right?
I mean, come on.
Tell me that's insane.
Yeah, he's gonna try to spin this into a reason that Robert can't run for governor.
Kitty.
You're gonna try to get on top of this.
What?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
Is... is... is this true?
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I'm...
I'm...
I'm...
I...
I'm gonna have to figure this out.
Um...
Um...
Uh...
Kit, it's me.
It's your little brother.
You can...
Please talk to me.
Yeah, yeah.
Please...
Tell me.
Tell me.
What... what...
what... what do you have?
Where is it?
I mean, how...
how long have you known?
It's lymphoma, and, Kevin, I...
I am so sorry that you had to find out this way.
No, no, no.
That's okay.
Oh, God.
I'm gonna have to tell everybody now.
No.
No, you don't.
You absolutely don't.
Look, I c...
I can keep this a secret as long as you want.
I know you don't think I can.
I...
I will.
I promise.
No.
No, you know what?
I think it's actually better if I just tell everybody at once, you know, just to... just to get it out there.
Y... y... you know what...
you know what I can do?
Is I can call mom, and I'll...
I'll just have her arrange one of her... one of her dinners, but... but it's like...
Kev.
Kev, it's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Yes, Nora.
Of course I'm gonna be there.
Yeah.
Uh, I'll leave as soon as I can.
Okay, dear.
Bye.
So that guy that just stole 10,000 gallons of wine right out from under us?
Well, it turns out he was indicted on felony charges years ago for price fixing at Voley Foods.
Didn't william work at voley back then?
So what are you getting at?
Come on, Saul.
Don't be cagey with me.
This guy just sabotaged a major component of my business plan.
Right.
He knew William, he's undermining us.
So what are we dealing with here, hmm?
What do you know?
Yes, they worked together at Voley Foods.
They started together, they shared accounts.
Obviously, they were very good at it and decided they wanted to be on their own, and they needed capital.
Let me guess... they stole from the company.
There was an investigation.
Maybe William kept his hands clean, maybe he saw it coming.
I don't know.
But he ended up testifying, and Dennis ended up doing five years.
Why does this not surprise me?
That's all I know, and right now I have to be somewhere.
Where are you going?
I mean, if this is some ancient grudge match, then we've gotta talk about this.
That can wait.
This can't.
Maybe this is about Sarah.
Okay, everyone, here she is.
Hey.
Hi, guys.
I'm, um, I'm so sorry to... to keep you waiting.
What's going on?
Oh, no.
Are you guys getting a divorce?
No, no.
No, no, no, no.
No, look, I'm so sorry.
I-I have gross anatomy class tomorrow morning, and my lab partner has a patent, so...
Well, um, it... it's... it's about me.
Oh, God.
Kevin.
Kevin, are you crying?
Oh, Kevin, don't.
Saul.
Saul?
Saul, why are... why are you crying?
I had to tell someone.
Well, somebody better tell us.
I'm starting to panic here.
Uh, yeah.
It's okay.
It's... it's... it's...
I...
I...
I have cancer.
It's, uh, it's lymphoma.
It's in... it's in stage III, which... which isn't the worst.
Kitty.
Um, it just... it just means that it... it's spread a little bit.
But it's not in her bone marrow.
No, and... and my oncologist is... is very positive about the prognosis.
It's just a matter now of deciding what treatment to do.
Chemo or radiation?
Well, R-chop probably, which is chemo.
It's the standard of care.
Well, maybe.
I...
She's also been accepted into a clinical trial in Boston.
I have?
Yeah, I made a call.
Robert, I asked you not to make that call.
You may be going to Boston?
Wh... no.
I...
I... well, I may...
I don't know.
I don't...
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Mom, can you please sit down?
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm just gonna take some time and... and, uh, figure out what to do.
Um, but, you know, I...
let's just have a normal night.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
It's gonna be... it's gonna be fine, and... and mom made some turkey meat loaf, and...
Yeah.
Come on.
Let's...
let's all sit down and eat.
Um, Robert, I could, uh, use your help in the kitchen.
I can't believe you made that call.
I asked you not to start throwing your weight around.
Hey, I'm gonna keep our options open.
They are Kitty's options to decide.
You just told everybody she was doing r-chop.
I did not.
I said probably.
Crap.
Nora, look, she wasn't accepted into this trial because I made a call.
She...
You don't know that.
You would only know that had you not made the call.
She was accepted because they think it's gonna save her life.
Well, of course they would say that.
They're the ones running the study.
Look, I started a cancer center.
I happen to know the politics of clinical trials.
And I know the politics of this family,
And you don't want her in Boston because you want her here with you.
Oh, God, do you think I would jeopardize the health of my daughter for geography?
Jeez!
Don't touch those buns.
So how's the, uh, surrogacy going?
Well, you know...
Coming along.
Mm.
Good.
I've got garlic rolls.
A few fell on the ground, Mmm.
But 10-second rule.
They'll be fine.
They'll be fine.
Oh, no, thanks.
Thanks, mom.
Oh, so you're reading it, huh?
See?
I better go into the kitchen and see what's going on.
I think she needs some help.
She practically threw up the lining of her stomach.
Well, that's a hell of a lot better than what might happen to her if she decides to be a lab rat.
Guys... rolls.
Stage III... h... how bad is that?
I mean, will she have to be hospitalized?
I know nothing about oncology.
You're a med student.
In basic anatomy.
Oh, God.
I dragged her dress shopping today.
You know what she kept talking about?
How we could all be hit by a bus tomorrow.
I mean, she was right.
We all have been.
Your poor mom.
Oh, my mom.
Look, uh, why don't we go help her with dinner, okay?
Yeah.
Blood clots in the lungs and heart failure or nausea and hair loss... pick one.
I...
I can't pick one, Nora.
It's impossible to...
Pick one, Saul.
Pick one.
Saul.
Saul.
Saul, the study we're talking about increases her chances of beating this, period.
She can beat it with R-chop without jeopardizing her health any further.
And besides that, her family is here.
Her support system is here.
Right.
Right.
I agree with Nora on this, Robert.
Of course you do, because it's always a package deal with you guys...
What?
That's crazy, Robert.
Everybody together, no matter what.
But this isn't Thanksgiving that we're talking about.
Don't you dare to talk to me like... don't patronize me.
All right, all right...
I'm not patronizing you.
There is an agenda...
I'm not talking about Thanksgiving.
We're talking...
You know what I just thought of?
I mean, I...
I could cook for you.
I could leave a big cooler outside your door with fresh meals in it every day, and you wouldn't have to worry about that.
That's really sweet, Scotty, but you know what?
I'm not gonna be an invalid.
I'm gonna be able to cook.
But I...
I have, um, I have the answer for you guys... live-in nanny.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
Look, I know you want to talk about meat loaf and babies, but I...
I can't sit here and pretend everything's normal.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I...
I feel like I should talk to him.
Yeah, it's okay.
I...
I understand.
Y... you should go get him.
Okay.
Look, mom's right.
That's all they talk about in rehab, is your support system.
Kitty doesn't have an addiction.
You know what?
Kitty's alone out there.
You know, Robert, if it is such a good treatment, why is it not the standard of care?
That's right.
And... and tell me, why hasn't the American cancer association come out and supported it or the F.D.A. approved it?
Why?
Because the f.D.A. won't update its protocols and streamline their approvals.
Oh, for goodness sakes.
You have no idea how many drugs that could save people's lives are just stuck in bureaucratic red tape.
You don't know which one is which.
But what about A.Z.T.?
They approved that in seven days.
Exactly.
Exactly.
After huge political pressure.
No one's marching on capitol hill for lymphoma.
Thank you, Kevin.
She should have the most aggressive treatment possible.
Kevin, aggressive could kill her.
No, no, cancer could kill her.
Aggressive could kill...
Mom.
Mom.
Guys.
What?
Wh...
Oh, Kitty.
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm so sorry.
I mean, I know...
I know this was just such a... a... a shock, but, you know, all this... all this fighting is... is... is not gonna help me, and it's... it's not gonna help anything.
You know, I just, um,
I just really wanted to have a... a normal dinner, you know?
And it was so... it was so crazy of me to think
That we could just eat and talk and... and be normal, because, of course, y... you're right.
You're right, Kev.
There's... there's nothing normal about...
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just...
Oh, God.
I'm tired.
I'm gonna get your things.
Yeah, I think I...
I think I need to...
I need to go home.
And, mom, I'm so sorry.
This was just such a bad idea.
Sorry.
It's okay.
I'll see you soon.
Can I say something that's wildly inappropriate?
If it has anything to do with death, dying or cancer,
I don't think I can take it.
Actually, it's about the opposite.
Okay.
Let's have a baby.
I warned you it was inappropriate.
I'm touched that you want to do this for me, but having a baby, it... it's just not gonna help.
I'm not trying to help.
You know, ever since this surrogacy idea came up,
I've been obsessed with what a huge obligation a baby would be, and all the precious time I'd lose.
And then tonight...
I don't want to wait until the "right time" to have a baby.
There is no right time.
But there is a wrong time.
All I can do right now is think about Kitty, and that wouldn't be fair to a... to a baby or to you.
Maybe in a couple of months?
Now you sound like me.
I'm sorry.
No.
We'll wait.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Wow.
Those textbooks must be really boring.
All right, so what are we gonna go with?
Are you gonna go with, uh, are you gonna go with strapless or...
Oh, what's this one called?
This one?
Halter.
Halter.
You don't have to do this.
Listen to me.
There is nothing more that I want in this world than to walk down that aisle with you, but the thought of Kitty forcing herself to celebrate...
She wouldn't be forcing herself.
Then everyone else would be.
Justin, you didn't want to elope because you wanted our entire families to be there to celebrate.
But it's not a celebration, not if Kitty's sick.
I mean, halter or strapless, whatever, it just... doesn't feel right, does it?
No.
I know that at our engagement party
I said...
I wanted our wedding to be a priority.
But right now I think that Kitty should be the priority.
So I was thinkin'... maybe we should postpone.
Come here.
I would have called, but I think you would have hung up on me.
Robert, it's late.
I'm not here to argue.
I think we need to get on the same page.
I don't know that we'll ever be on the same page.
Well, we both love Kitty.
I don't think we'd be fighting as much if we didn't.
Come in.
Have you talked to, um, Tommy or Sarah?
No.
I've left messages for both of them.
I haven't heard back.
But that's not why you're here, Robert.
Kitty's mad.
She's mad at me.
She's mad at you.
Yes.
And we've both been making this about ourselves, and it's not fair to her.
She needs to know that we're gonna support her... whatever decision she makes...
both of us she knows I'll support her.
No.
No, she knows you want her here with you.
Well, if she decides to go to Boston, I'll go with her there.
Well, then tell her.
Nora, she...
She needs you in... a lot of ways more than she needs me.
Look, you said that you didn't feel her life was safe in my hands.
Robert...
No, it's okay.
I mean, I know you've been angry.
I've been angry.
I'm angry at everything.
And Kitty and I were just beginning to try to rebuild our marriage, and now this.
Oh.
Robert, Kitty's right.
You... you can't stop living just because she's sick, and you certainly can't stop working on your relationship.
As a matter of fact, it's a very good time to start.
What if there's not enough time?
Stop.
Don't do that.
Kitty's going to be fine.
I'm sorry.
I...
I just can't imagine what it would be like if it were one of my kids.
Well, you would probably fight like hell with their spouse, too.
I don't want to fight.
Good.
Because I think we're gonna need each other.
The people on these tables donated themselves to become a vital part of your education.
Treat them with the respect that they deserve.
Yes?
Let's begin.
Okay, what's his name?
"Douglas, 47, died of pancreatic cancer."
You want the honors?
You all right?
Um, I'm... a...
I'm... a be right back.
Carter, you...
I...
I think he actually forgot his glasses somewhere.
Excuse me.
What, is this your first dead body?
Can you just... can you just give me a moment, please?
No, I can't.
Look, I was really intimidated by you, but right now, you're the one in the fetal position.
Yeah, you're making that real easy.
Thanks.
All right, look...
I know how to do this.
Okay?
I've been in war, and I've seen dead bodies.
And let me tell you something...
patients are a lot scarier.
All right?
Douglas in there... he... he can't cry, he can't scream in pain, he can't die.
So you're telling me you're not freaked out at all?
Oh, no, I'm freaked out.
I'm freaked out by the index card in there that says he died of pancreatic cancer at age 47.
You see, my sister, who's a little younger than that, was just diagnosed with lymphoma, okay?
And I bet that it's some boy genius like you who's gonna find a cure.
All right, you're terrified of Douglas?
I'm terrified I'm not gonna learn what I need to learn in order to be a doctor.
And I know you know the tendons like your a-b-c's, but last night I was busy, so I didn't get a chance to review.
I need this, and I'm not gonna let you screw this up.
So let's get in there and dissect the upper limb.
Come on.
Hey.
Will you do the cutting?
Yeah.
You bet.
Here, look.
Put these on.
Makes you look older.
Come on.
Um, listen.
I've been going over my research, and I find that there's some very compelling arguments toward doing the clinical trial.
Oh, God, mom.
I...
I'm just saying...
Whatever you decide, I...
I'm with you, 150%... 500%.
Robert and I both are.
Did he talk to you?
He didn't tell you?
Well, he showed up on my doorstep last night.
He did?
Yes, and, Kitty,
I'm sorry if it seemed like I was pressuring you.
And, you know, Boston is really not that far away, and it's a wonderful city.
There's Quincy market and Newbury Street.
Mom, it's not like
I would exactly be there to sightsee, okay?
No.
No, but we could make it work.
I would go with you, and I could take care of Evan.
And who knows?
Maybe we would go sightseeing.
You don't... you don't know how you'd feel.
Everybody responds differently to chemo.
Okay.
Fine.
You know what?
Maybe even Rebecca and Justin can have their honeymoon there.
Um, honey...
I...
I think their wedding plans are kind of in flux right now.
Well, why?
W... w... why?
Because of me?
Kitty, everyone needs time to process their own reaction.
Just... just look at Robert and me.
First we're gonna kill each other, and then we're having tea together in the middle of the night, which we could do in Boston.
We could have our own little Boston tea party.
All right.
All right.
You know what?
Sure.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Just... thank you.
You're not going to believe who wants to meet me for lunch.
Dennis York.
Tell me you hung up on him.
No.
I told him I'd meet him at McDonnelly's at 1:00.
Better to keep your enemies close.
Good idea.
Saul.
I didn't realize you'd be joining us.
Okay.
Uh, what are you drinking?
Uh, nothing.
Thank you.
I don't have much time.
Holly's not coming?
No, you just get me.
So what do you want?
I want those five years I spent in prison back.
Ah.
But I'll settle for a good investment.
I still know one when I see one.
Yeah, well, even if William screwed you, he's gone, Dennis.
Yeah, but his company's still alive and kicking.
Where do you think he got the idea to start one in the first place?
Are you suggesting that Ojai was your idea?
I'm not suggesting.
Whatever proprietary claims you think you have on Ojai ran out a long time ago.
Then you won't mind a little, uh, healthy competition?
Keep away from the company... and stay away from my family?
See you around, Saul.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing home?
Uh, I finished my royal duties, and I took the afternoon off.
Okay, so you went to my mother's in the middle of the night, and now you're home in the middle of the day?
Who are you, and what have you done with my husband?
Let's take Evan to the zoo.
Wow.
Wow.
Cancer has done wonders for you.
It's not the cancer.
I know you think it is.
I am here because there's nowhere else I'd rather be.
Okay.
I've made a decision.
I'm gonna do r-chop.
Okay.
I've been looking at these web sites,
I've spoken with a couple of other doctors, and they all agree that the prognosis is actually better in younger patients, and they all stress the importance of a support system.
I'm with you.
Well, good.
Good.
Because I also think that we should stay at my mother's during my treatments.
At your mother's?
Yeah, my... my mother's.
I know.
I know.
But... but you're not gonna be able to have every afternoon off, and this way we'll know that Evan is taken care of, and we'll definitely have our meals.
Okay.
Really?
Are... are... are you sure?
Look, if this is what you want to do, then this is what we are gonna do, period.
Cancer isn't some magical reset button, and I just want to make sure that we're still working on our marriage, whether you're sick or not.
You know, I remember when you had your heart attack, and you didn't let it define you.
I didn't understand it then, but I understand it now, and I am not gonna let this define me.
Edwaldo?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's the, you know, he's the major duomo gorilla at the zoo, but... but they were setting up for this wedding, and they have the most incredible site right by the lions.
Well, actually, that's, um, that's why we're here.
Um...
Yeah.
We were thinking about, you know, the... the wedding, and we're just thinking about postponing it a little bit, you know, until it's a good time.
Uh, I... you know, look, I know why you guys are doing this, and the thing is, is that it is a really good time.
I...
I...
I need something to look forward to.
I mean, we all do.
I mean, think about it.
If mom doesn't have flowers and caterers to obsess over, she's going to start obsessing about me.
We just want you to be able to enjoy yourself.
Well, why the hell wouldn't I be able to enjoy it, Rebecca?
Come on.
If you guys want to do something for me, you won't postpone.
You'll have showers and bachelor parties, and you'll let me help you register.
And I...
I...
I j...
I just can't think that life is... is... is gonna stop now.
I mean, does that make any sense?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, it's like the, uh, you know, that camping trip.
Yeah.
Remember?
And guess what.
I was fine.
Yes, her appendix burst, and it was, like,
Wednesday, you got your appendectomy, what, Sunday, you were, like, fine, pitching a tent, and, you know, spearing fish.
Yeah, right.
So no more...
no more, uh, "in flux." Okay?
But this... it's under one condition.
Kitty, I would really love for you to be my matron of honor.
Oh, R...
Rebecca...
No, no, I was gonna ask you anyway.
She was, yeah.
I was.
When you asked me to be your bridesmaid, it made me feel like your sister.
And I don't have a sister, so...
Oh.
Well, yes.
I mean, of course.
Yeah?
Yes.
Thank you.
All right.
Is the wedding back on?
Uh, yes.
So tell them that this is the most incredible place to get married.
Where?
The zoo.
Well, Justin will fit right in.
Come on.
Let's eat.
Wow.
If that's the pizza guy, I'm joining politics.
Nora.
Mom.
I don't have to stay mom.
I just thought I'd swing by and bring last night's leftovers.
Oh, pl... please tell me that that is the turkey meat loaf.
It's the turkey meat loaf and the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.
And I stopped by...
I got a cheesecake.
See?
That's why we're gonna stay with her.
Wait, Robert, too?
We're like two peas in a pod.
Wait.
I...
I can't tell.
Are they kidding?
No, no, no.
They... they've already had, like, these nighttime tea parties.
Hi.
We were just in your incredibly remote neighborhood...
Carrying a 4-course meal...
So we thought we'd stop by...
'cause that's how we roll.
Did you rehearse that in the car?
Yeah, a little bit.
Hi.
Hi.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe you're here.
Wow.
Well, thank you.
Whoa!
Hold the door!
Saul!
Wow.
Wow!
There's a party.
Oh, I'm so glad I brought a whole case.
Was that you on the road behind us?
Was it me?
Who else is gonna shine their brights on you...
Oh, you guys should have communicated.
You should have carpooled.
Is this too much for you, all of us here?
No, no, this is great.
I'm...
I'm...
I'm very happy.
Let...
let's...
let's eat.
Yes, move outside.
Come on.
Everybody outside.
I hope that our wedding is this easy to cater.
Oh, the best thing about planning a wedding is all the tastings.
Tastings?
Yes.
My husband's the best chef in town.
Oh, Kevin.
Oh, that's why you came today.
You're auditioning for the job.
Scotty, we would love for you to do it.
Yeah, we just didn't want to assume you'd be...
No, no, no.
Assume away.
I would love to.
I'm warning you now... he's not cheap.
Okay, where were we?
Another one?
Are you all right?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm...
I'm just...
I'm...
I'm happy.
No, I'll get it.
Who is that?
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
What's with the traffic jam in your driveway?
Sarah.
Oh, Kitty.
Oh!
I'm so happy you're here.
How do you think that makes me feel?
Also, Terri said she's pregnant, wow.
But really, she's faking and Mr. Schuster doesn't know.
This baby's the only reason he's still here.
Will's busy getting the kids ready for sectionals
Where they're up against a school for the deaf...
I can't hear you.
Talk into this ear.
Scarlet fever.
You're on!
...And a group of juvie girls.
Aphasia, give Mr. Schuster his wallet back.
But it turns out both of them are really good.
It's like cool epilepsy.
Also, sue kicked Quinn out
Of the cheerios because she's pregnant.
I can't have a pregnant girl on my squad.
You're a disgrace.
It's not very nice, but neither is Sue.
Those drinks are crap!
And that's what you missed on... glee.
Hey, guys.
Mind if I join you?
So, what's with all the primping?
Yearbook pictures.
This is the 50th edition
Of the McKinley high school thunderclap.
I'm going to drop 20 pounds by Friday,
Look smoking hot for that photo,
And be down to a trim 210 for the wedding a week Saturday.
Of course, the wedding
Was going to be in Hawaii, but then they told me
I couldn't bring my own fruit, so...
But, sectionals is a week from Saturday.
Oh, man.
Looks like you won't be able to make it, Eminem.
I, um, I totally forgot about sectionals.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I wanted to go.
For the kids.
We're not rescheduling.
The vfw hall is booked till next June.
The only reason this Saturday is available
Is 'cause it's the one year anniversary
Of that grisly fish fry shoot-out.
I got a monster discount.
We just got to be out of there before the candlelight vigil.
I remember.
Oh, my gosh.
Sue?
Did someone finally punch you?
Edie.
William.
You.
Every year, when the photos for the thunderclap
Come around, I always elect to have a little work done.
This year, I got myself a bit of an eye lift.
And while they were in there,
I told them to go ahead and yank out those tear ducts.
Wasn't using them.
You know, I got a storage unit
Full of trophies and medallions.
But, for the rest of you educators,
These yearbook pictures
Are really the only concrete proof you have
That anything you've done
In your sorry little lives
Has made any difference whatsoever.
My cheerios are so excited.
Got them on a yam diet.
It draws the water out of the skin.
Well, I'm sure my glee kids are going to be excited, too.
Well, glee kids don't get a photo.
What?
Why is that?
Well, I just had a meeting with principal Figgins, Eleanor,
And what with all the vandalism
Of the glee club photos over the years,
I convinced him that putting the glee kids
In this year's thunderclap was subjecting the little freaks
To more humiliation
And ridicule.
Why can't you just accept the fact that my kids
Are going to take sectionals this year?
That's not happening.
And stop with the pointless vendetta.
Right.
This is so not fair, Sue.
You know, I'm going to talk to Figgins about this.
Hey, good luck with that.
You know, you three are boring me now.
I'm going to go do something else.
Where's Rachel?
She's not here yet.
Perfect.
Glee club stands on a delicate precipice.
We have all felt the cold
Humiliation of a slushie in the face.
But as of right now, our relative anonymity as a club
Shields us from more severe persecution-
Swirlies.
Patriotic wedgies.
What's a patriotic wedgie?
It's when they hoist you up the flag pole by your undies.
Strangely, it did make me feel more American.
Based on my investigation,
I am of the opinion that a yearbook photo
Would only fuel the flames of anti-glee-club terror.
I've done a little library research.
Peter gellar.
Glee club second tenor, 1998.
He can be seen here with both
A drawn on Hitler mustache and rice paddy hat.
Shortly after the yearbook came out,
Mr. Gellar had a nervous breakdown.
He is now the homeless man
Who sleeps in front of the public library.
Patches?
Patches.
He barks at my mom.
Exhibit b.
Tawny Peterson.
Glee club class of 2000.
Seen here in her photo with a cartoon knife stuck in her head,
In a macabre tableau that, in four years,
Would prove eerily prescient.
I think I speak for all of us when I say
That not having to pose for a yearbook photo
Might be a blessing in disguise.
I suggest not fighting Figgins' ruling.
Oh, hey, guys.
Ah.
Looking at old thunderclaps?
It's really unsettling.
And totally unfair.
Hey, can I borrow one of these?
You know what?
This year's thunderclap
Is going to have a glee club photo with every one
Of your smiling faces.
You have my word on it.
Shue, I'm doing the glee club a solid.
We're denying the opportunity to other children
To further humiliate them.
No, no, no.
Those kids get up on stage all the time,
No matter what anyone thinks of them,
And they perform.
They don't let anyone or anything get to them.
That's something you should encourage.
Sue is wrong!
Fine.
I'll give them a photo.
Thank you.
For $1,000.
What?
That's what is costs.
The yearbook is prime advertising space, Shue.
Frederickson's funeral parlor
Experienced a 1.3% increase in revenue
After their full page ad last year in the thunderclap.
Okay, um...
What about a quarter page?
How much does that cost?
$325.
That will buy you enough space for a photo
Of two members of the glee club.
Right below the advertisement
For uncle Sandro's chicken inside of a waffle.
Figgins, that's a lot of money.
It's a compromise, Shue.
Now, I suggest you select a good-looking cheerleader-
Not the pregnant one-
And the quarterback for the photo
As their faces are less likely
To be scratched out with safety pins.
Mr. Schuster, I'm very sorry to interrupt.
Principal Figgins,
As you very well may know, this is my first year
In glee club and I've just been informed
That new directions has not been afforded a yearbook photo.
As you might expect, my two gay dads
Have a very close relationship with our local branch
Of the aclu and if it's up to me...
Beat you to the punch, Rachel.
It's all good.
We're in the yearbook.
Oh.
Fantastic.
Thank you so much.
Make fun of me all you want,
But school pictures are everything to me.
They're great practice for getting photographed
By the paparazzi.
Invasive as the press may be,
Stars are dependent on them for their fame,
And I feel I must be prepared.
In order to do so, I join every club I possibly can.
Know you're thinking that I'm just joining all of these clubs
To give off the appearance that I'm involved, known to exist,
But glee club is different.
I really love glee
And I believe in what we stand for.
We've come from behind,
Dismissed and ridiculed by everyone,
And we've made something of ourselves,
Something that I'm proud to be a part of,
Something I want to be remembered for.
Oh, that's got the whole flag.
I miss my cheerios uniform.
Made me feel safe.
Contained.
Even when I was feeling left out,
At least I looked like I was a part of something.
I want my kids to be able to look back at these books
And see who I was,
Make them proud.
Not the bastard one I'm carrying now, of course,
The ones I'll have when I'm married and ready.
I might not look like the head cheerleader anymore,
But I'm still her on the inside.
I'm done playing the victim.
When that cheerleading picture is taken for the yearbook,
I'm going to be in it and back on the squad,
Whether Sue Sylvester likes it or not.
Hey, baby.
Which one of these ties goes better with my shirt?
You're blocking the TV, will.
Oh, come on.
I need your help.
School pictures are coming up.
Oh.
Well, in that case, um...
Wear the red one for the teacher photo
And the green one for the glee club.
Okay.
It'll pop more when the cool kids deface it.
Yeah.
I, uh...
I wanted to talk to you about that.
So, Figgins stopped putting the glee club photo in the yearbook
Because it always gets vandalized,
And I just feel so bad for the kids.
I mean, they work so hard.
They deserve to be recognized.
Not being in that book gives the appearance
That glee club isn't important.
I want to buy an ad and use it as the glee club photo spread.
It's around $300.
Oh, great.
Yeah, why don't you take the food
Out of the refrigerator and just give that to the kids?
Will, that food goes from my mouth
Right into our baby's belly.
We have a couple hundred bucks left over
From selling the blue bomber ii.
The answer's no, will.
No.
But if we...
No!
No.
No.
Actually, can you wait to cash that until Thursday?
Kurt, I have a fantastic idea for a club
That would officially make me the most involved student
In the whole school.
I want us to start a gaylesball.
I'm sorry?
The gay-lesbian alliance.
Gay-lesb-all.
Hey, guys!
Great news!
Glee club gets a photo in the thunderclap.
yep.
It's going to show everyone at the school
That glee club is on its way up.
When we win regionals,
Those claps are going to be collector's items.
I mean, all of your classmates are going to be
Begging for your autographs.
But I had to compromise to do it.
Um, we only get a quarter page in back.
Which means we have to pick two team captains
To appear in the photo.
So, tomorrow we're going to put it to a vote.
Exciting, huh?
All right.
Well, we're all here.
I guess we should vote.
With your permission,
I have prepared a few words.
I nominate Rachel.
Second.
All right, let's vote up in this piece.
I gotta go hit the gym and load up the guns of puckerone
For the football picture.
Looks like everybody voted for Rachel.
Including Rachel.
But we need two captains, guys.
Why two?
We're fine with having Rachel represent us
In the thunderclap by herself.
We'd actually prefer it.
The worst part is
That after all this time,
They're still embarrassed to be in glee club.
I mean, they still see themselves as losers.
I just need to get one of them
To step up and become co-captain.
Well, maybe you should let them use the captain
They already elected.
You know, sometimes sound a lot different coming from a peer.
Even if that peer is an annoying as Rachel.
You know,
None of this is going to matter if they win at sectionals.
I'm really sorry I can't be there.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.
I
- I kind of think ken scheduled your wedding
The same day on purpose.
You know,
So...
So you couldn't go.
Why would he do that?
Come on.
We both know how he feels about our...
Relationship.
I'm marrying ken, will.
Look, I know that I've...
I've definitely given him reason in the past
To be jealous, but I need you to know
That I'm done with that now.
Ken has a lot of flaws.
He has 74 flaws as of yesterday, but, you know what,
He is not vindictive.
He's actually a very good man.
He is kind and he's great with the students here at McKinley.
We have that in common.
And yes, it's true, his hygiene could be a lot better,
But he is absolutely full of compassion
And...
Well, that is why I'm marrying him.
You're right.
I was out of line.
It won't happen again.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Shue?
Oh, yeah, Rach.
Sit down.
So, how's the new captaincy going?
I think that my unanimous election
Gave me a very strong mandate to shake things up.
Great.
Well,
I have a job for you, captain.
We need a co-captain.
You have so many great ideas,
No reason you shouldn't have some help
Pushing them through.
I could use a trusty lieutenant.
I do have over 65 proposals.
So, can I count on you?
No problem.
I'm on it.
Um, I can't be co-captain.
No time.
Kwanza.
Kwanza's late December, Mercedes.
The photo's this Thursday.
Yeah, prepping early this year.
I'd love to be in the photo, Rachel,
But you'd be standing and I'd be sitting
And it would throw off the whole composition.
I'll lean over.
But if you lean over...
It will look like you have stomach rolls.
On second thought,
I don't think that you're leadership material, Artie.
Follower.
Brittany, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
No way.
Why not?
Because I don't want to be in a picture with you.
It'll get defaced.
No, it won't.
Yes, it will.
I'll be the one doing it.
I'm desperate.
Glee club needs you, Finn.
I'm totally honored you asked me,
But don't you think you should pick somebody
Who, like, cares more?
Not that I don't,
But I just have football and friends and stuff.
Glee club only started working after you joined.
Face it, we wouldn't have all of the cheerleaders
And football players in the club
If it wasn't for you.
You know I love glee club.
I just don't know why I have to represent it.
Because you're a leader, Finn.
And that's what leaders do.
They stick their necks out for people that they care about.
There are stakes here.
Morale is low, you know it.
If things don't change,
We're not even going to place at sectionals.
And then the club is over.
I can't do this alone.
You don't have to.
I am a leader.
That's who I am, who I want to be.
You got yourself a co-captain.
I'll do the picture with you.
I totally understand that as captain of the football team,
You've worked really hard to project an appearance
Of steely toughness, but glee club is different.
We have to present the appearance
Of positivity and optimism.
So...
We're gonna practice,
And I'm going to teach you
How to smile correctly for your photo.
when you first left me, I was wanting more you were kissing that girl next door what'd you do that for?
what'd you do that for?
when you first left me
I didn't know what to say
I never been on my own that way own that way just sat by myself all day myself all day
I was so lost back then ah... but with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end ah... and now you're calling me up on the phone so you can have a little whine and a moan ah... and it's only because you're feeling alone ah... at first, when I see you cry... it makes me smile
yeah, it makes me smile at worst I feel bad for a while but then I just smile
I go ahead and smile
at first when I see you cry see you cry it makes me smile makes me smile yeah, it makes me smile yeah, it makes me smile at worst I feel bad for a while feel bad for a while but then I just smile
I go ahead and smile smile go ahead and smile.
What the hell?
!
Hey, man, shh, we're practicing, dude.
Chill out.
We heard you're going to be in the glee club photo,
And we don't want to mess up messing it up.
Screw you, Karofsky!
I'm sick of you pulling people down.
Hey, man, don't talk that kum-bah-yay-yah crap.
All right, you know the system's put in place
To keep order around here.
You know what, I'm gonna give you some options, okay?
Do you want me to put the Hitler mustache
On your glee club picture, or you want the buck teeth
On your glee club picture?
Which one do you want?
It don't matter to me either way.
I'll put...
Hey, how do you spell "loser"?
I'm gonna write it on his forehead.
His big ol' potato head.
You could write a whole haiku on that thing.
Can we shake a leg here?
Fine.
I'm ready.
I'll...
Do it myself.
wait, I...
I insist on only being shot from my left side.
Yeah, I kind of need to see your teeth.
It's sort of my job here.
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm upset.
My co-captain bailed and it just...
I'm sorry, I just need a minute.
Snap out of this.
Stop being defined by what other people think of you,
Or how they disappoint you.
It's lonely at the top, you know that.
What's that song about overcoming
Professional and personal disappointments?
Oh, yeah.
when you're smiling, when you're smiling the whole world smiles with you.
I'm ready.
Great.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That-that's it?
I practiced over 18 different poses
For this shoot, and I haven't even shown you
Any of my over the left shoulder pose.
See?
Sorry, kid, I got to blow.
I got a casting session in half an hour.
A...
A casting session for what?
My brother-in-law is shooting a commercial for his store.
I'm directing it.
I just do these school photos for the money.
Uh, uh, okay.
Wait, no, don't...
I can take a couple more pictures for you.
I can cry on demand.
It's one of my many talents.
I'm very versatile,
And aside from nudity and the exploitation of animals,
I'll pretty much do anything to break into the business.
We-well, you certainly seem talented and all,
But I need...
There's other speaking parts in this thing.
I need, like, a bunch of other actors, too.
I can help with that.
I'd like to call this meeting to order.
Oh, hello, Finn.
How nice of you to show.
Look, I'm sorry.
The guys were harassing me
In the locker room about it.
They said that if I took the glee club photo,
That they'd make me choose between an Hitler mustache
Or buck teeth, and I can't rock either of those looks.
Do you think I have a potato head?
Okay, look, I realize now
That all of you think that glee club is just a joke.
Okay, and you're convinced
That we can't win, and you're content to just sit idle by
Until Figgins cancels the club.
Well,
I'm about to present to you a rare opportunity.
The opportunity to become stars.
How?
We've all been cast in a local commercial.
Are you serious?
Yes, Finn,
And while all of you have been
So concerned with your appearance in this school,
I've landed glee club its first big break.
Simply put,
Making us all celebrities.
Okay, and no one
Messes with celebrities or defaces their pictures.
What's the commercial?
Hold on to your hats and get ready to sell Some mattresses!
I'm getting a nice pair of black suspenders.
Simple black.
My mom's going to be really proud.
Let's do our camera face.
I can't believe we're finally breaking into the biz!
You guys, I want us to always remember this moment.
Soon, there may be agents and managers and movie deals,
But right now I want us to remember what it feels like
To be here together as a team.
Whatever.
Soon as I get my record deal,
I'm not speaking to any of you.
Okay, guys, we're very excited to have you here.
We here at mattress land believe that mattresses
Aren't just for sleeping and fornicating anymore.
We believe that buying an affordable mattress
Should be fun.
All right, let's go over the script.
I think it's pretty brilliant.
I wrote it myself.
Action!
"ah, me. "
"what's wrong?"
"we just lost our jobs...
"at the factory,
And we can't get a good night's sleep. "
"chipper up!
"come on down to mattress land.
"we've got near-wholesale prices
To fit your style and pocketbook. "
I
- I'm sorry.
Mr. Cusperberg.
This script is brilliant,
But we're a glee club, and we should perform.
Perform the lines as I wrote them.
Wait a minute, Dennis.
What did you have in mind?
I get up and nothing gets me down
you got it tough
I've seen the toughest around and I know baby, just how you feel
you've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real
oh, can't you see me standing here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen ain't the worst that you've seen oh, can't you see what I mean?
can't you see what I mean?
yeah might as well jump
Jump!
might as well jump go ahead, jump jump!
go ahead and jump jump... jump...
Yeah might as well jump might as well jump go ahead and jump
go ahead and jump jump, jump, jump
jump!
Come on down to mattress land!
Come on down to mattress land!
Terri, have you seen my pocket square?
Terri?
Terri?
A pocket square's gonna make you look like ted knight.
What is this?
It's a pregnancy pad.
They have them at the maternity stores for trying on clothes
So you can see how you're gonna look when you're showing.
Kendra stole it for me so I could see
If any of her old clothes would fit...
Pick up your shirt.
What?
No.
Pick up your shirt.
You're scaring me, will.
Think about what you're accusing me of.
Think about it and turn around and go find your pocket square.
Please?
Why did you do this to us?
I don't understand!
I thought you were leaving me.
You're so different, will.
We both know it.
I can feel you.
You're pulling away from me.
Why, because I-I've started standing up to you?
Trying to make this a relationship of equals?
No, because of the damn glee club.
Ever since you started it,
You just walk around
Like you're better than me!
I should be allowed to feel good about myself!
Who are we kidding, will?
This marriage works because
You don't feel good about yourself.
This marriage works because I love you,
Because I've always accepted you, good and bad.
You loved the girl you met when you were 15.
I'm not that girl.
You've made yourself a stranger to me now.
Are you happy?
Are you satisfied?
!
It didn't start as a lie.
I really thought I was pregnant.
And then the doctor,
He said it was a hysterical pregnancy, and I...
I just panicked!
This is insane.
What were you gonna do when the due date came?
Quinn Fabray.
It was so perfect.
She didn't want hers, and I needed one.
I had the doctor use her ultrasound DVD
At your appointment that you came to.
I loved you, Terri.
I really loved you.
I'm so sorry, will.
I'm so sorry.
Do you remember at that appointment?
Do you remember what we said?
That at that moment, no matter what happened,
We loved each other.
We could get that feeling back again.
You could love me back, will!
Please, will!
Please, don't go!
Please, don't go!
Please?
!
Oh, god.
Am I asking for too much,
Ohio board of statewide holiday planning?
All I want is just one day a year
Where I'm not visually assaulted by uglies and fatties.
Seriously, Ohio, these retinas need a day off.
So here's the dream:
Friday after Christmas- which I have off-
If you're hideous, stay at home.
Spend the entire day watching home videos of a time
When you weren't too repulsive for me
To ever want to look at.
And that's how Sue sees it.
Rod.
Slammin', Sue.
We'll be right back.
Hey, Andrea, that "Sue's corner" I just did,
Was talking about you.
go ahead and jump!
Who says finding a mattress can't be fun?
At mattress land,
We have mattresses of all shapes and sizes
At prices that won't break your pocketbook.
No credit?
No problem!
Mattress land has a no-hassle financing
Of 12.9% with no money down and no payments till next year.
You'll jump for joy at our prices.
Come on down to mattress land!
Coach Sylvester, we need to talk.
Oh, I got nothing to say to you, prego.
The cheerios' photo's tomorrow, and I want back on that squad.
Oh, is that what you want?
Well, what I wanted was a head cheerleader who wasn't going
To hoist her legs behind her ears in the backseat
Of the first station wagon she could jimmy open,
Throwing away any chance she ever had in life.
It would be good for the school.
Show everyone that appearances don't matter.
That sometimes people have to deal with a little adversity.
I learned that in glee club.
Well, that little educational proverb must have slithered
From will Schuester's mouth right after his lesson
On how to disqualify yourselves from sectionals.
What?
Saw your little commercial last night.
Boy, did you glee kids step in it.
Shue, I'm afraid Sue is right.
You have indeed stepped in it.
No, I didn't even know this was going on.
Of course, you didn't, William.
You wouldn't know if your glee club was using your office
To breed rabbits for pets or for food.
And you know why?
You're too busy chasing tail and loading your hair
With enormous amounts of product!
I mean, today it just looks like you put lard in it.
What are you even talking about?
!
Look, look, the kids did the commercial
To foster a feeling of unity after you-
Not anyone else - you got them banned from the yearbook.
That's what I did, yes, I admit it.
It was an innocent mistake.
And what if I were to just innocently murder you, will?
I'd still have to go to trial.
Probably get off with justifiable homicide.
Let me review the rules for you.
William, amendment 63, seventh addendum:
"no professional activity of any kind will be tolerated,
"and payment for services rendered negates amateur status,
Triggering immediate disqualification. "
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, keep it civil.
Hey, what, mister?
!
No, keep it simple, folks!
Keep it simple.
Hey, I'm sorry, Shue,
But I cannot let this slide.
But the kids weren't even paid!
There's a stack of mattresses in the choir room
Piled as high as the empty hair gel bottles
In the dumpster outside your apartment!
Okay, we'll give the mattresses back.
Shue, one of those mattresses was used.
You can't return a used mattress.
You can't even donate one to charity.
Lice, bedbugs
- I looked it up online!
Is there any reason that you have
A soiled mattress in your office, will?
Have you and the redhead become so sexually depraved
That you have to commit your craven acts of adultery
In between classes?
What?
You know what, okay, fine.
I slept here, all right?
Excuse me?
I'm thinking about leaving my wife.
Well, I didn't see that one coming at all.
William, I am very sorry about your personal troubles
But my hands are tied.
Sue's right - you broke the rules.
I cannot fight the scholastic board.
I'm sorry but glee club is over.
It's over!
"dear journal,
"I've finally gotten will Schuester
"and that glee club out of my hair.
"this is a day that will live in infamy.
Once again, I've won. "
Miss Sylvester.
It's like looking at a porno star in a nun's habit.
I wanted to show you that it still fits.
My baby bump isn't that bad,
It's just like I had a big lunch.
Take it off.
You need to get it through your pregnant head,
There's no way you're getting in that photo
Or back on the cheerios.
End of story.
You're a hypocrite.
Excuse me?
I just heard that you got glee club's
Amateur status revoked over a mattress.
While you are constantly
Showering the cheerios with swag.
I've gotten free shoes,
Complimentary tanning, haircuts.
The season tickets to cedar point-
We sold those on eBay.
For a profit.
It seems to me that if Figgins found out,
You would get banned from competition.
Fine.
You're back on the cheerios.
I'll put you on full-time dry cleaning duty
And shove you to the back of the photo to hide your shame.
I'm not finished.
Glee club gets a full page photo.
That's not up to me.
You are giving up one of the cheerios' six pages
And you are giving it to the glee club free of charge.
You know, q, I'd forgotten
Just how ruthless you really are.
You're like a young Sue Sylvester.
Now, get out of my office.
If you can manage to squeeze through the door
Without your water breaking all over my new carpet.
You know what?
I don't think I want to be a cheerio after all.
I don't want to be on a team where I only appear to belong.
I'd rather be a part of a club that's proud to have me
Like glee club.
It's my fault.
If I hadn't slept on that mattress,
We could've just returned them and moved on.
Hey, can I give you some advice?
Please.
You need to give yourself a break.
you do.
You'll figure out what to do with the kids, you always do.
But I think right now
You really need to focus on your own life.
You know, divorce is a really big deal.
Who said anything about getting a divorce?
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.
I just assumed
That that's...
Is that what you would do?
Well, um...
When I first heard about
What Terri had done,
Oh, gosh, no, I thought there should be some sort of law.
But then when I thought
About it some more,
Thought about what I would've done
If I'd felt you slipping away...
You would never be that cruel.
No, her methods were wrong, but, um,
I totally understand her intentions.
You're a lot to lose, will.
But we don't want to go to sectionals without you.
It's without me or not at all.
Look, I was the one who slept on the mattress,
Which means I accepted them, not you.
Which means I'm disqualified from competition,
Not you guys.
He's taking the bullet for us.
Solid.
We have worked too hard
For you guys not to get your shot.
We can't do this without you, Mr. Shue.
Hell, we probably can't do it with you.
That's not true.
You guys are good.
You're really good.
You did "jump" for that commercial without me, right?
Look, the best teachers don't give you the answers.
They just point the way and let you make your own choices.
Your own mistakes.
That way you get all the glory.
And you deserve it.
Look, if...
If you can't win without me there,
Then I haven't done my job.
We're really sorry, Mr. Shue.
I know.
I want you guys to go get gussied up
And take that glee club photo with pride.
I want to see a smile on every one of your faces.
smile though your heart is aching smile even though it's breaking when there are clouds in the sky you'll get by if you smile through your pain and sorrow smile and maybe tomorrow you'll see the sun come shining through
for you light up your face with gladness hide every trace of sadness although a tear may be ever so near that's the time you must keep on trying smile, what's the use of crying?
you'll find that life is still worthwhile if you just smile
smile though your heart is aching is aching smile even though it's breaking it's breaking when there are clouds in the sky you'll get by that's the time you must keep on trying smile, what's the use of crying?
you'll find that life is still worthwhile if you just smile you'll find that life is still worthwhile if you just smile... smile.
So here's what you missed last week....
Emma and Ken are getting married though it seems she really likes Will...
If we were gonna rate crush-worthy teachers at this school you'd be number one with a bullet.
Which Ken kinda noticed which makes him really NOT like Will.
You and I... the whole world knows that I'm just a consolation prize to you...
How do you think that makes me feel?
Also, Terri said she's pregnant, wow.
But really, she's faking and Mr. Schuster doesn't know.
This baby's the only reason he's still here.
Will's busy getting the kids ready for sectionals
Where they're up against a school for the deaf...
I can't hear you.
Talk into this ear.
Scarlet fever.
You're on!
...And a group of juvie girls.
Aphasia, give Mr. Schuster his wallet back.
But it turns out both of them are really good.
It's like cool epilepsy.
Also, Sue kicked Quinn out
Of the cheerios because she's pregnant.
I can't have a pregnant girl on my squad.
You're a disgrace.
It's not very nice, but neither is Sue.
Those drinks are crap!
And that's what you missed on...
~~ Glee. ~~
Hey, guys.
Mind if I join you?
So, what's with all the primping?
Yearbook pictures.
This is the 50th edition
Of the McKinley high school Thunderclap.
I'm going to drop 20 pounds by Friday,
Look smoking hot for that photo,
And be down to a trim 210 for the wedding a week Saturday.
Emma:
Of course, the wedding
Was going to be in Hawaii, but then they told me
I couldn't bring my own fruit, so...
But, sectionals is a week from Saturday.
Oh, man.
Looks like you won't be able to make it, Eminem.
I, um, I totally forgot about sectionals.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I wanted to go.
For the kids.
We're not rescheduling.
The vfw hall is booked till next June.
The only reason this Saturday is available
Is 'cause it's the one year anniversary
Of that grisly fish fry shoot-out.
I got a monster discount.
We just got to be out of there before the candlelight vigil.
Emma:
I remember.
Oh, my gosh.
Sue?
Did someone finally punch you?
Edie.
Wiliam.
You.
Every year, when the photos for the thunderclap
Come around, I always elect to have a little work done.
This year, I got myself a bit of an eye lift.
And while they were in there,
I told them to go ahead and yank out those tear ducts.
Wasn't using them.
You know, I got a storage unit
Full of trophies and medallions.
But, for the rest of you educators,
These yearbook pictures
Are really the only concrete proof you have
That anything you've done
In your sorry little lives
Has made any difference whatsoever.
(slurping)
My cheerios are so excited.
Got them on a yam diet.
It draws the water out of the skin.
Well, I'm sure my glee kids are going to be excited, too.
Well, glee kids don't get a photo.
What?
Why is that?
Well, I just had a meeting with principal Figgins, Eleanor,
And what with all the vandalism
Of the glee club photos over the years,
I convinced him that putting the glee kids
In this year's thunderclap was subjecting the little freaks
To more humiliation
And ridicule.
Why can't you just accept the fact that my kids
Are going to take sectionals this year?
That's not happening.
And stop with the pointless vendetta.
Emma:
Right.
This is so not fair, Sue.
You know, I'm going to talk to Figgins about this.
Hey, good luck with that.
You know, you three are boring me now.
I'm going to go do something else.
(groans)
Where's Rachel?
She's not here yet.
Perfect.
Glee club stands on a delicate precipice.
We have all felt the cold
Humiliation of a slushie in the face.
But as of right now, our relative anonymity as a club
Shields us from more severe persecution--
Swirlies.
Patriotic wedgies.
What's a patriotic wedgie?
It's when they hoist you up the flag pole by your undies.
Strangely, it did make me feel more American.
Based on my investigation,
I am of the opinion that a yearbook photo
Would only fuel the flames of anti-glee-club terror.
I've done a little library research.
Peter gellar.
Glee club second tenor, 1998.
He can be seen here with both
A drawn on Hitler mustache and rice paddy hat.
Shortly after the yearbook came out,
Mr. Gellar had a nervous breakdown.
He is now the homeless man
Who sleeps in front of the public library.
Patches?
Patches.
He barks at my mom.
Kurt:
Exhibit b.
Tawny Peterson.
Glee club class of 2000.
Seen here in her photo with a cartoon knife stuck in her head,
In a macabre tableau that, in four years,
Would prove eerily prescient.
I think I speak for all of us when I say
That not having to pose for a yearbook photo
Might be a blessing in disguise.
I suggest not fighting Figgins' ruling.
Will:
Oh, hey, guys.
Ah.
Looking at old thunderclaps?
It's really unsettling.
And totally unfair.
Hey, can I borrow one of these?
You know what?
This year's thunderclap
Is going to have a glee club photo with every one
Of your smiling faces.
You have my word on it.
Shue, I'm doing the glee club a solid.
We're denying the opportunity to other children
To further humiliate them.
No, no, no.
Those kids get up on stage all the time,
No matter what anyone thinks of them,
And they perform.
They don't let anyone or anything get to them.
That's something you should encourage.
Sue is wrong!
Fine.
I'll give them a photo.
Thank you.
For $1,000.
What?
That's what is costs.
The yearbook is prime advertising space, Shue.
Frederickson's funeral parlor
Experienced a 1.3% increase in revenue
After their full page ad last year in the thunderclap.
Okay, um...
What about a quarter page?
How much does that cost?
(sighs)
$325.
That will buy you enough space for a photo
Of two members of the glee club.
Right below the advertisement
For Uncle Sandro's chicken inside of a waffle.
Figgins, that's a lot of money.
It's a compromise, Shue.
Now, I suggest you select a good-looking cheerleader--
Not the pregnant one--
And the quarterback for the photo
As their faces are less likely
To be scratched out with safety pins.
Mr. Schuster, I'm very sorry to interrupt.
Principal Figgins,
As you very well may know, this is my first year
In glee club and I've just been informed
That new directions has not been afforded a yearbook photo.
As you might expect, my two gay dads
Have a very close relationship with our local branch
Of the aclu and if it's up to me...
Beat you to the punch, Rachel.
It's all good.
We're in the yearbook.
Oh.
Fantastic.
Thank you so much.
Rachel:
Make fun of me all you want,
But school pictures are everything to me.
They're great practice for getting photographed
By the paparazzi.
Invasive as the press may be,
Stars are dependent on them for their fame,
And I feel I must be prepared.
In order to do so, I join every club I possibly can.
Know you're thinking that I'm just joining all of these clubs
To give off the appearance that I'm involved, known to exist,
But glee club is different.
I really love glee
And I believe in what we stand for.
We've come from behind,
Dismissed and ridiculed by everyone,
And we've made something of ourselves,
Something that I'm proud to be a part of,
Something I want to be remembered for.
(giggling)
Oh, that's got the whole flag.
Quinn:
I miss my cheerios uniform.
Made me feel safe.
Contained.
Even when I was feeling left out,
At least I looked like I was a part of something.
I want my kids to be able to look back at these books
And see who I was,
Make them proud.
Not the bastard one I'm carrying now, of course,
The ones I'll have when I'm married and ready.
I might not look like the head cheerleader anymore,
But I'm still her on the inside.
I'm done playing the victim.
When that cheerleading picture is taken for the yearbook,
I'm going to be in it and back on the squad,
Whether Sue Sylvester likes it or not.
Hey, baby.
Which one of these ties goes better with my shirt?
You're blocking the tv, Will.
Oh, come on.
I need your help.
School pictures are coming up.
Oh.
Well, in that case, um...
Wear the red one for the teacher photo
And the green one for the glee club.
Okay.
It'll pop more when the cool kids deface it.
Yeah.
I, uh...
I wanted to talk to you about that.
So, Figgins stopped putting the glee club photo in the yearbook
Because it always gets vandalized,
And I just feel so bad for the kids.
I mean, they work so hard.
They deserve to be recognized.
Not being in that book gives the appearance
That glee club isn't important.
(sighs)
I want to buy an ad and use it as the glee club photo spread.
It's around $300.
Oh, great.
Yeah, why don't you take the food
Out of the refrigerator and just give that to the kids?
Will, that food goes from my mouth
Right into our baby's belly.
We have a couple hundred bucks left over
From selling the blue bomber ii.
The answer's no, Will.
No.
But if we...
No!
No.
No.
(sighs)
Actually, can you wait to cash that until Thursday?
(sighs)
(bell ringing)
(playing scales)
Kurt, I have a fantastic idea for a club
That would officially make me the most involved student
In the whole school.
I want us to start a gaylesball.
I'm sorry?
The gay-lesbian alliance.
Gay-lesb-all.
Hey, guys!
Great news!
Glee club gets a photo in the thunderclap.
(murmuring unenthusiastically) yep.
It's going to show everyone at the school
That glee club is on its way up.
When we win regionals,
Those claps are going to be collector's items.
I mean, all of your classmates are going to be
Begging for your autographs.
(halfhearted cheering)
But I had to compromise to do it.
Um, we only get a quarter page in back.
Which means we have to pick two team captains
To appear in the photo.
So, tomorrow we're going to put it to a vote.
Exciting, huh?
All right.
(bell ringing)
Well, we're all here.
I guess we should vote.
With your permission,
I have prepared a few words.
I nominate Rachel.
Second.
All right, let's vote up in this piece.
I gotta go hit the gym and load up the guns of Puckerone
For the football picture.
Looks like everybody voted for Rachel.
Including Rachel.
But we need two captains, guys.
Why two?
We're fine with having Rachel represent us
In the thunderclap by herself.
We'd actually prefer it.
(bell ringing)
Will:
The worst part is
That after all this time,
They're still embarrassed to be in glee club.
I mean, they still see themselves as losers.
To step up and become co-captain.
Well, maybe you should let them use the captain
They already elected.
You know, sometimes sound a lot different coming from a peer.
Even if that peer is an annoying as Rachel.
You know,
None of this is going to matter if they win at sectionals.
I'm really sorry I can't be there.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.
I-I kind of think Ken scheduled your wedding
The same day on purpose.
You know,
So...
So you couldn't go.
Why would he do that?
Come on.
We both know how he feels about our...
Relationship.
I'm marrying Ken, Will.
Look, I know that I've...
I've definitely given him reason in the past
To be jealous, but I need you to know
That I'm done with that now.
Ken has a lot of flaws.
He has 74 flaws as of yesterday, but, you know what,
He is not vindictive.
He's actually a very good man.
He is kind and he's great with the students here at McKinley.
We have that in common.
And yes, it's true, his hygiene could be a lot better,
But he is absolutely full of compassion
And...
Well, that is why I'm marrying him.
You're right.
I was out of line.
It won't happen again.
(bell ringing)
You wanted to see me, Mr. Shue?
Oh, yeah, Rach.
Sit down.
So, how's the new captaincy going?
I think that my unanimous election
Gave me a very strong mandate to shake things up.
Great.
Well,
I have a job for you, captain.
We need a co-captain.
You have so many great ideas,
No reason you shouldn't have some help
Pushing them through.
I could use a trusty lieutenant.
I do have over 65 proposals.
So, can I count on you?
No problem.
I'm on it.
Um, I can't be co-captain.
No time.
Kwanza.
Kwanza's late December, Mercedes.
The photo's this Thursday.
Yeah, prepping early this year.
("You Might Think" by the Cars playing)
I'd love to be in the photo, Rachel,
But you'd be standing and I'd be sitting
And it would throw off the whole composition.
I'll lean over.
But if you lean over...
It will look like you have stomach rolls.
On second thought,
I don't think that you're leadership material, Artie.
Follower.
Brittany, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
No way.
Why not?
Because I don't want to be in a picture with you.
It'll get defaced.
No, it won't.
Yes, it will.
I'll be the one doing it.
Rachel:
I'm desperate.
Glee club needs you, Finn.
I'm totally honored you asked me,
But don't you think you should pick somebody
Who, like, cares more?
Not that I don't,
But I just have football and friends and stuff.
Glee club only started working after you joined.
Face it, we wouldn't have all of the cheerleaders
And football players in the club
If it wasn't for you.
You know I love glee club.
I just don't know why I have to represent it.
Because you're a leader, Finn.
And that's what leaders do.
They stick their necks out for people that they care about.
There are stakes here.
Morale is low, you know it.
If things don't change,
We're not even going to place at sectionals.
And then the club is over.
I can't do this alone.
You don't have to.
I am a leader.
That's who I am, who I want to be.
You got yourself a co-captain.
I'll do the picture with you.
I totally understand that as captain of the football team,
You've worked really hard to project an appearance
Of steely toughness, but glee club is different.
We have to present the appearance
Of positivity and optimism.
So...
We're gonna practice,
And I'm going to teach you
How to smile correctly for your photo.
("Smile" begins playing)
~~ when you first left me, I was wanting more ~~
~~ you were kissing that girl next door ~~
~~ what'd you do that for?
~~ ~~ what'd you do that for?
~~
~~ when you first left me ~~
Both:
~~ I didn't know what to say ~~
~~ I never been on my own that way ~~ ~~ own that way ~~
~~ just sat by myself all day ~~ ~~ myself all day ~~
~~ I was so lost back then ~~ ~~ ah... ~~
~~ but with a little help from my friends ~~
~~ I found a light in the tunnel at the end ~~
~~ ah... ~~ ~~ and now you're calling me up on the phone ~~
~~ so you can have a little whine and a moan ~~ ~~ ah... ~~
~~ and it's only because you're feeling alone ~~ ~~ ah... ~~
~~ at first, when I see you cry... ~~
~~ it makes me smile ~~
~~ yeah, it makes me smile ~~
~~ at worst I feel bad for a while ~~
~~ but then I just smile ~~
~~ I go ahead and smile ~~
~~ la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la ~~

(Rachel giggling, fades)
What the hell?
!
Hey, man, shh, we're practicing, dude.
Chill out.
We heard you're going to be in the glee club photo,
And we don't want to mess up messing it up.
Screw you, Karofsky!
I'm sick of you pulling people down.
Hey, man, don't talk that kum-bah-yay-yah crap.
All right, you know the system's put in place
To keep order around here.
You know what, I'm gonna give you some options, okay?
Do you want me to put the Hitler mustache
On your glee club picture, or you want the buck teeth
On your glee club picture?
Which one do you want?
It don't matter to me either way.
I'll put...
(grunts)
Hey, how do you spell "loser"?
I'm gonna write it on his forehead.
His big ol' potato head.
You could write a whole haiku on that thing.
(bell rings)
Can we shake a leg here?
Fine.
I'm ready.
I'll...
Do it myself.
(shutter clicks) wait, I...
I insist on only being shot from my left side.
Yeah, I kind of need to see your teeth.
It's sort of my job here.
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm upset.
My co-captain bailed and it just...
I'm sorry, I just need a minute.
Rachel:
Snap out of this.
Stop being defined by what other people think of you,
Or how they disappoint you.
It's lonely at the top, you know that.
What's that song about overcoming
Professional and personal disappointments?
Oh, yeah.
~~ when you're smiling, when you're smiling ~~
~~ the whole world smiles with you. ~~
I'm ready.
Great.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That-that's it?
I practiced over 18 different poses
For this shoot, and I haven't even shown you
Any of my over the left shoulder pose.
See?
Sorry, kid, I got to blow.
I got a casting session in half an hour.
A...
A casting session for what?
My brother-in-law is shooting a commercial for his store.
I'm directing it.
I just do these school photos for the money.
(sobbing)
Uh, uh, okay.
Wait, no, don't...
I can take a couple more pictures for you.
I can cry on demand.
It's one of my many talents.
I'm very versatile,
And aside from nudity and the exploitation of animals,
I'll pretty much do anything to break into the business.
We-well, you certainly seem talented and all,
But I need...
There's other speaking parts in this thing.
I need, like, a bunch of other actors, too.
I can help with that.
I'd like to call this meeting to order.
Oh, hello, Finn.
How nice of you to show.
Finn:
Look, I'm sorry.
The guys were harassing me
In the locker room about it.
They said that if I took the glee club photo,
That they'd make me choose between an Hitler mustache
Or buck teeth, and I can't rock either of those looks.
Do you think I have a potato head?
Rachel:
Okay, look, I realize now
That all of you think that glee club is just a joke.
Okay, and you're convinced
That we can't win, and you're content to just sit idle by
Until Figgins cancels the club.
Well,
I'm about to present to you a rare opportunity.
The opportunity to become stars.
How?
We've all been cast in a local commercial.
Are you serious?
Yes, Finn,
And while all of you have been
So concerned with your appearance in this school,
I've landed glee club its first big break.
Simply put,
Making us all celebrities.
Okay, and no one
Messes with celebrities or defaces their pictures.
What's the commercial?
Hold on to your hats and get ready to sell Some mattresses!
(excited chatter)
I'm getting a nice pair of black suspenders.
Simple black.
My mom's going to be really proud.
Let's do our camera face.
I can't believe we're finally breaking into the biz!
You guys, I want us to always remember this moment.
Soon, there may be agents and managers and movie deals,
But right now I want us to remember what it feels like
To be here together as a team.
Whatever.
Soon as I get my record deal,
I'm not speaking to any of you.
(snickering)
Okay, guys, we're very excited to have you here.
We here at mattress land believe that mattresses
Aren't just for sleeping and fornicating anymore.
We believe that buying an affordable mattress
Should be fun.
All right, let's go over the script.
I think it's pretty brilliant.
I wrote it myself.
Action!
(clears throat) "ah, me."
"what's wrong?"
"we just lost our jobs...
"at the factory,
And we can't get a good night's sleep."
Rachel:
"chipper up!
"come on down to mattress land.
"we've got near-wholesale prices
To fit your style and pocketbook."
I-I'm sorry.
Mr. Cusperberg.
This script is brilliant,
But we're a glee club, and we should perform.
Perform the lines as I wrote them.
Wait a minute, Dennis.
What did you have in mind?
~~ ba, ba, ba ~~
~~ ba-ba, ba-da ~~
~~ ba, ba-da-da ~~
(melodious yell) ~~ ba, ba, ba ~~
~~ ba, ba, ba-da ~~

Come on down to mattress land!
All:
Come on down to mattress land!
Uh...
Terri, have you seen my pocket square?
(sighs)
Terri?
(sighs)
Terri?
A pocket square's gonna make you look like Ted Knight.
What is this?
It's a pregnancy pad.
They have them at the maternity stores for trying on clothes
So you can see how you're gonna look when you're showing.
Kendra stole it for me so I could see
If any of her old clothes would fit...
Pick up your shirt.
What?
No.
(clattering)
Pick up your shirt.
You're scaring me, Will.
Think about what you're accusing me of.
Think about it and turn around and go find your pocket square.
(gasps)
Please?
(gasping breath)
(whimpers)
(gasps)
Why did you do this to us?
I don't understand!
I thought you were leaving me.
You're so different, Will.
We both know it.
I can feel you.
You're pulling away from me.
Why, because I-I've started standing up to you?
Trying to make this a relationship of equals?
No, because of the damn glee club.
Ever since you started it,
You just walk around
Like you're better than me!
I should be allowed to feel good about myself!
Who are we kidding, Will?
This marriage works because
You don't feel good about yourself.
This marriage works because I love you,
Because I've always accepted you, good and bad.
You loved the girl you met when you were 15.
I'm not that girl.
You've made yourself a stranger to me now.
Are you happy?
Are you satisfied?
!
It didn't start as a lie.
I really thought I was pregnant.
And then the doctor,
He said it was a hysterical pregnancy, and I...
I just panicked!
This is insane.
What were you gonna do when the due date came?
Quinn Fabray.
It was so perfect.
She didn't want hers, and I needed one.
I had the doctor use her ultrasound DVD
At your appointment that you came to.
(scoffs)
I loved you, Terri.
I really loved you.
I'm so sorry, Will.
I'm so sorry.
Do you remember at that appointment?
Do you remember what we said?
That at that moment, no matter what happened,
We loved each other.
We could get that feeling back again.
You could love me back, Will!
Please, Will!
Please, don't go!
Please, don't go!
Please?
!
Oh, god.
Sue:
Am I asking for too much,
Ohio board of statewide holiday planning?
All I want is just one day a year
Where I'm not visually assaulted by uglies and fatties.
Seriously, Ohio, these retinas need a day off.
So here's the dream:
Friday after christmas-- which I have off--
If you're hideous, stay at home.
Spend the entire day watching home videos of a time
When you weren't too repulsive for me
To ever want to look at.
And that's how Sue sees it.
Rod.
Slammin', Sue.
We'll be right back.
Hey, andrea, that "Sue's Corner" I just did,
Was talking about you.
(on tv):
~~ go ahead and jump!
~~
Rachel:
Who says finding a mattress can't be fun?
At mattress land,
We have mattresses of all shapes and sizes
At prices that won't break your pocketbook.
No credit?
No problem!
Mattress land has a no-hassle financing
Of 12.9% with no money down and no payments till next year.
You'll jump for joy at our prices.
All:
Come on down to mattress land!
(school bell ringing)
Coach Sylvester, we need to talk.
Oh, I got nothing to say to you, prego.
The cheerios' photo's tomorrow, and I want back on that squad.
Oh, is that what you want?
Well, what I wanted was a head cheerleader who wasn't going
To hoist her legs behind her ears in the backseat
Of the first station wagon she could jimmy open,
Throwing away any chance she ever had in life.
It would be good for the school.
Show everyone that appearances don't matter.
That sometimes people have to deal with a little adversity.
I learned that in glee club.
Well, that little educational proverb must have slithered
From Will Schuester's mouth right after his lesson
On how to disqualify yourselves from sectionals.
What?
Saw your little commercial last night.
Boy, did you glee kids step in it.
Shue, I'm afraid Sue is right.
You have indeed stepped in it.
No, I didn't even know this was going on.
Of course, you didn't, Wiliam.
You wouldn't know if your glee club was using your office
To breed rabbits for pets or for food.
And you know why?
You're too busy chasing tail and loading your hair
With enormous amounts of product!
I mean, today it just looks like you put lard in it.
What are you even talking about?
!
Look, look, the kids did the commercial
To foster a feeling of unity after you--
Not anyone else-- you got them banned from the yearbook.
That's what I did, yes, I admit it.
It was an innocent mistake.
And what if I were to just innocently murder you, Will?
I'd still have to go to trial.
Probably get off with justifiable homicide.
Let me review the rules for you.
Wiliam, amendment 63, seventh addendum:
"no professional activity of any kind will be tolerated,
"and payment for services rendered negates amateur status,
Triggering immediate disqualification."
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, keep it civil.
Hey, what, mister?
!
No, keep it simple, folks!
Keep it simple.
Hey, I'm sorry, Shue,
But I cannot let this slide.
But the kids weren't even paid!
There's a stack of mattresses in the choir room
Piled as high as the empty hair gel bottles
In the dumpster outside your apartment!
Okay, we'll give the mattresses back.
Shue, one of those mattresses was used.
You can't return a used mattress.
You can't even donate one to charity.
Lice, bedbugs-- I looked it up online!
Is there any reason that you have
A soiled mattress in your office, Will?
Have you and the redhead become so sexually depraved
That you have to commit your craven acts of adultery
In between classes?
What?
You know what, okay, fine.
I slept here, all right?
Excuse me?
(sighs)
I'm thinking about leaving my wife.
Well, I didn't see that one coming at all.
Wiliam, I am very sorry about your personal troubles
But my hands are tied.
Sue's right-- you broke the rules.
I cannot fight the scholastic board.
I'm sorry but glee club is over.
It's over!
Sue:
"Dear Journal,
"I've finally gotten Will Schuester
"and that glee club out of my hair.
"this is a day that will live in infamy.
Once again, I've won."
Miss Sylvester.
It's like looking at a porno star in a nun's habit.
I wanted to show you that it still fits.
My baby bump isn't that bad,
It's just like I had a big lunch.
Take it off.
You need to get it through your pregnant head,
There's no way you're getting in that photo
Or back on the cheerios.
End of story.
You're a hypocrite.
Excuse me?
I just heard that you got glee club's
Amateur status revoked over a mattress.
While you are constantly
Showering the cheerios with swag.
I've gotten free shoes,
Complimentary tanning, haircuts.
The season tickets to Cedar Point--
We sold those on ebay.
For a profit.
It seems to me that if Figgins found out,
You would get banned from competition.
Fine.
You're back on the cheerios.
I'll put you on full-time dry cleaning duty
And shove you to the back of the photo to hide your shame.
I'm not finished.
Glee club gets a full page photo.
That's not up to me.
You are giving up one of the cheerios' six pages
And you are giving it to the glee club free of charge.
You know, Q, I'd forgotten
Just how ruthless you really are.
You're like a young Sue Sylvester.
Now, get out of my office.
If you can manage to squeeze through the door
Without your water breaking all over my new carpet.
You know what?
I don't think I want to be a cheerio after all.
I don't want to be on a team where I only appear to belong.
I'd rather be a part of a club that's proud to have me
Like glee club.
(sighing):
It's my fault.
If I hadn't slept on that mattress,
We could've just returned them and moved on.
Hey, can I give you some advice?
Please.
You need to give yourself a break.
(scoffs) you do.
You'll figure out what to do with the kids, you always do.
But I think right now
You really need to focus on your own life.
You know, divorce is a really big deal.
Who said anything about getting a divorce?
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.
I just assumed
That that's...
Is that what you would do?
Well, um...
When I first heard about
What Terri had done,
Oh, gosh, no, I thought there should be some sort of law.
But then when I thought
About it some more,
Thought about what I would've done
If I'd felt you slipping away...
You would never be that cruel.
No, her methods were wrong, but, um,
I totally understand her intentions.
You're a lot to lose, Will.
But we don't want to go to sectionals without you.
(sighs)
It's without me or not at all.
Look, I was the one who slept on the mattress,
Which means I accepted them, not you.
Which means I'm disqualified from competition,
Not you guys.
He's taking the bullet for us.
Solid.
(sighing):
We have worked too hard
For you guys not to get your shot.
We can't do this without you, Mr. Shue.
Hell, we probably can't do it with you.
That's not true.
You guys are good.
You're really good.
You did "Jump" for that commercial without me, right?
Look, the best teachers don't give you the answers.
They just point the way and let you make your own choices.
Your own mistakes.
That way you get all the glory.
And you deserve it.
Look, if...
If you can't win without me there,
Then I haven't done my job.
We're really sorry, Mr. Shue.
I know.
I want you guys to go get gussied up
And take that glee club photo with pride.
I want to see a smile on every one of your faces.
~~ ~~
~~ smile though your heart is aching ~~
~~ smile even though it's breaking ~~
~~ when there are clouds in the sky ~~
~~ you'll get by ~~
~~ if you smile through your pain and sorrow ~~
~~ smile and maybe tomorrow ~~
~~ you'll see the sun come shining through ~~
~~ for you ~~
~~ light up your face with gladness ~~
~~ hide every trace of sadness ~~

"A day without a laugh is a wasted day."
- Charles Chaplin
How do you think that makes me feel?
Also, terri said she's pregnant, wow.
But really, she's faking and mr.
Schuster doesn't know.
This baby's the only reason he's still here.
Will's busy getting the kids ready for sectionals
Where they're up against a school for the deaf...
I can't hear you.
Talk into this ear.
Scarlet fever.
You're on!
...And a group of juvie girls.
Aphasia, give mr.
Schuster his wallet back.
But it turns out both of them are really good.
It's like cool epilepsy.
Also, sue kicked quinn out
Of the cheerios because she's pregnant.
I can't have a pregnant girl on my squad.
You're a disgrace.
It's not very nice, but neither is sue.
Those drinks are crap!
And that's what you missed on...
¶ glee. ¶
Hey, guys.
Mind if I join you?
So, what's with all the primping?
Yearbook pictures.
This is the 50th edition
Of the mckinley high school thunderclap.
I'm going to drop 20 pounds by Friday,
Look smoking hot for that photo,
And be down to a trim 210 for the wedding a week Saturday.
Emma:
Of course, the wedding
Was going to be in hawaii, but then they told me
I couldn't bring my own fruit, so...
But, sectionals is a week from Saturday.
Oh, man.
Looks like you won't be able to make it, eminem.
I, um, I totally forgot about sectionals.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I wanted to go.
For the kids.
We're not rescheduling.
The vfw hall is booked till next June.
The only reason this Saturday is available
Is 'cause it's the one year anniversary
Of that grisly fish fry shoot-out.
I got a monster discount.
We just got to be out of there before the candlelight vigil.
Emma:
I remember.
Oh, my gosh.
Sue?
Did someone finally punch you?
Edie.
William.
You.
Every year, when the photos for the thunderclap
Come around, I always elect to have a little work done.
This year, I got myself a bit of an eye lift.
And while they were in there,
I told them to go ahead and yank out those tear ducts.
Wasn't using them.
You know, I got a storage unit
Full of trophies and medallions.
But, for the rest of you educators,
These yearbook pictures
Are really the only concrete proof you have
That anything you've done
In your sorry little lives
Has made any difference whatsoever.
(slurping)
My cheerios are so excited.
Got them on a yam diet.
It draws the water out of the skin.
Well, I'm sure my glee kids are going to be excited, too.
Well, glee kids don't get a photo.
What?
Why is that?
Well, I just had a meeting with principal figgins, eleanor,
And what with all the vandalism
Of the glee club photos over the years,
I convinced him that putting the glee kids
In this year's thunderclap was subjecting the little freaks
To more humiliation
And ridicule.
Why can't you just accept the fact that my kids
Are going to take sectionals this year?
That's not happening.
And stop with the pointless vendetta.
Emma:
Right.
This is so not fair, sue.
You know, I'm going to talk to figgins about this.
Hey, good luck with that.
You know, you three are boring me now.
I'm going to go do something else.
(groans)
Where's rachel?
She's not here yet.
Perfect.
Glee club stands on a delicate precipice.
We have all felt the cold
Humiliation of a slushie in the face.
But as of right now, our relative anonymity as a club
Shields us from more severe persecution--
Swirlies.
Patriotic wedgies.
What's a patriotic wedgie?
It's when they hoist you up the flag pole by your undies.
Strangely, it did make me feel more american.
Based on my investigation,
I am of the opinion that a yearbook photo
Would only fuel the flames of anti-glee-club terror.
I've done a little library research.
Peter gellar.
Glee club second tenor, 1998.
He can be seen here with both
A drawn on hitler mustache and rice paddy hat.
Shortly after the yearbook came out,
Mr. Gellar had a nervous breakdown.
He is now the homeless man
Who sleeps in front of the public library.
Patches?
Patches.
He barks at my mom.
Kurt:
Exhibit b.
Tawny peterson.
Glee club class of 2000.
Seen here in her photo with a cartoon knife stuck in her head,
In a macabre tableau that, in four years,
Would prove eerily prescient.
I think I speak for all of us when I say
That not having to pose for a yearbook photo
Might be a blessing in disguise.
I suggest not fighting figgins' ruling.
Will:
Oh, hey, guys.
Ah.
Looking at old thunderclaps?
It's really unsettling.
And totally unfair.
Hey, can I borrow one of these?
You know what?
This year's thunderclap
Is going to have a glee club photo with every one
Of your smiling faces.
You have my word on it.
Shue, I'm doing the glee club a solid.
We're denying the opportunity to other children
To further humiliate them.
No, no, no.
Those kids get up on stage all the time,
No matter what anyone thinks of them,
And they perform.
They don't let anyone or anything get to them.
That's something you should encourage.
Sue is wrong!
Fine.
I'll give them a photo.
Thank you.
For $1,000.
What?
That's what is costs.
The yearbook is prime advertising space, shue.
Frederickson's funeral parlor
Experienced a 1.3% increase in revenue
After their full page ad last year in the thunderclap.
Okay, um...
What about a quarter page?
How much does that cost?
(sighs)
$325.
That will buy you enough space for a photo
Of two members of the glee club.
Right below the advertisement
For uncle sandro's chicken inside of a waffle.
Figgins, that's a lot of money.
It's a compromise, shue.
Now, I suggest you select a good-looking cheerleader--
Not the pregnant one--
And the quarterback for the photo
As their faces are less likely
To be scratched out with safety pins.
Mr. Schuster, I'm very sorry to interrupt.
Principal figgins,
As you very well may know, this is my first year
In glee club and I've just been informed
That new directions has not been afforded a yearbook photo.
As you might expect, my two gay dads
Have a very close relationship with our local branch
Of the aclu and if it's up to me...
Beat you to the punch, rachel.
It's all good.
We're in the yearbook.
Oh.
Fantastic.
Thank you so much.
Rachel:
Make fun of me all you want,
But school pictures are everything to me.
They're great practice for getting photographed
By the paparazzi.
Invasive as the press may be,
Stars are dependent on them for their fame,
And I feel I must be prepared.
In order to do so, I join every club I possibly can.
Know you're thinking that I'm just joining all of these clubs
To give off the appearance that I'm involved, known to exist,
But glee club is different.
I really love glee
And I believe in what we stand for.
We've come from behind,
Dismissed and ridiculed by everyone,
And we've made something of ourselves,
Something that I'm proud to be a part of,
Something I want to be remembered for.
(giggling)
Oh, that's got the whole flag.
Quinn:
I miss my cheerios uniform.
Made me feel safe.
Contained.
Even when I was feeling left out,
At least I looked like I was a part of something.
I want my kids to be able to look back at these books
And see who I was,
Make them proud.
Not the bastard one I'm carrying now, of course,
The ones I'll have when I'm married and ready.
I might not look like the head cheerleader anymore,
But I'm still her on the inside.
I'm done playing the victim.
When that cheerleading picture is taken for the yearbook,
I'm going to be in it and back on the squad,
Whether sue sylvester likes it or not.
Hey, baby.
Which one of these ties goes better with my shirt?
You're blocking the tv, will.
Oh, come on.
I need your help.
School pictures are coming up.
Oh.
Well, in that case, um...
Wear the red one for the teacher photo
And the green one for the glee club.
Okay.
It'll pop more when the cool kids deface it.
Yeah.
I, uh...
I wanted to talk to you about that.
So, figgins stopped putting the glee club photo in the yearbook
Because it always gets vandalized,
And I just feel so bad for the kids.
I mean, they work so hard.
They deserve to be recognized.
Not being in that book gives the appearance
That glee club isn't important.
(sighs)
I want to buy an ad and use it as the glee club photo spread.
It's around $300.
Oh, great.
Yeah, why don't you take the food
Out of the refrigerator and just give that to the kids?
Will, that food goes from my mouth
Right into our baby's belly.
We have a couple hundred bucks left over
From selling the blue bomber ii.
The answer's no, will.
No.
But if we...
No!
No.
No.
(sighs)
Actually, can you wait to cash that until Thursday?
(sighs)
(bell ringing)
(playing scales)
Kurt, I have a fantastic idea for a club
That would officially make me the most involved student
In the whole school.
I want us to start a gaylesball.
I'm sorry?
The gay-lesbian alliance.
Gay-lesb-all.
Hey, guys!
Great news!
Glee club gets a photo in the thunderclap.
(murmuring unenthusiastically) yep.
It's going to show everyone at the school
That glee club is on its way up.
When we win regionals,
Those claps are going to be collector's items.
I mean, all of your classmates are going to be
Begging for your autographs.
(halfhearted cheering)
But I had to compromise to do it.
Um, we only get a quarter page in back.
Which means we have to pick two team captains
To appear in the photo.
So, tomorrow we're going to put it to a vote.
Exciting, huh?
All right.
(bell ringing)
Well, we're all here.
I guess we should vote.
With your permission,
I have prepared a few words.
I nominate rachel.
Second.
All right, let's vote up in this piece.
I gotta go hit the gym and load up the guns of puckerone
For the football picture.
Looks like everybody voted for rachel.
Including rachel.
But we need two captains, guys.
Why two?
We're fine with having rachel represent us
In the thunderclap by herself.
We'd actually prefer it.
(bell ringing)
Will:
The worst part is
That after all this time,
They're still embarrassed to be in glee club.
I mean, they still see themselves as losers.
I just need to get one of them
To step up and become co-captain.
Well, maybe you should let them use the captain
They already elected.
You know, sometimes sound a lot different coming from a peer.
Even if that peer is an annoying as rachel.
You know,
None of this is going to matter if they win at sectionals.
I'm really sorry I can't be there.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.
I-I kind of think ken scheduled your wedding
The same day on purpose.
You know,
So...
So you couldn't go.
Why would he do that?
Come on.
We both know how he feels about our...
Relationship.
I'm marrying ken, will.
Look, I know that I've...
I've definitely given him reason in the past
To be jealous, but I need you to know
That I'm done with that now.
Ken has a lot of flaws.
He has 74 flaws as of yesterday, but, you know what,
He is not vindictive.
He's actually a very good man.
He is kind and he's great with the students here at mckinley.
We have that in common.
And yes, it's true, his hygiene could be a lot better,
But he is absolutely full of compassion
And...
Well, that is why I'm marrying him.
You're right.
I was out of line.
It won't happen again.
(bell ringing)
You wanted to see me, mr.
Shue?
Oh, yeah, rach.
Sit down.
So, how's the new captaincy going?
I think that my unanimous election
Gave me a very strong mandate to shake things up.
Great.
Well,
I have a job for you, captain.
We need a co-captain.
You have so many great ideas,
No reason you shouldn't have some help
Pushing them through.
I could use a trusty lieutenant.
I do have over 65 proposals.
So, can I count on you?
No problem.
I'm on it.
Um, I can't be co-captain.
No time.
Kwanza.
Kwanza's late December, mercedes.
The photo's this Thursday.
Yeah, prepping early this year.
("you might think" by the cars playing)
I'd love to be in the photo, rachel,
But you'd be standing and I'd be sitting
And it would throw off the whole composition.
I'll lean over.
But if you lean over...
It will look like you have stomach rolls.
On second thought,
I don't think that you're leadership material, artie.
Follower.
Brittany, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
No way.
Why not?
Because I don't want to be in a picture with you.
It'll get defaced.
No, it won't.
Yes, it will.
I'll be the one doing it.
Rachel:
I'm desperate.
Glee club needs you, finn.
I'm totally honored you asked me,
But don't you think you should pick somebody
Who, like, cares more?
Not that I don't,
But I just have football and friends and stuff.
Glee club only started working after you joined.
Face it, we wouldn't have all of the cheerleaders
And football players in the club
If it wasn't for you.
You know I love glee club.
I just don't know why I have to represent it.
Because you're a leader, finn.
And that's what leaders do.
They stick their necks out for people that they care about.
There are stakes here.
Morale is low, you know it.
If things don't change,
We're not even going to place at sectionals.
And then the club is over.
I can't do this alone.
You don't have to.
I am a leader.
That's who I am, who I want to be.
You got yourself a co-captain.
I'll do the picture with you.
I totally understand that as captain of the football team,
You've worked really hard to project an appearance
Of steely toughness, but glee club is different.
We have to present the appearance
Of positivity and optimism.
So...
We're gonna practice,
And I'm going to teach you
How to smile correctly for your photo.
("smile" begins playing)
¶ when you first left me, I was wanting more ¶
¶ you were kissing that girl next door ¶
¶ what'd you do that for?
¶ ¶ what'd you do that for?
¶
¶ when you first left me ¶

(rachel giggling, fades)
What the hell?
!
Hey, man, shh, we're practicing, dude.
Chill out.
We heard you're going to be in the glee club photo,
And we don't want to mess up messing it up.
Screw you, karofsky!
I'm sick of you pulling people down.
Hey, man, don't talk that kum-bah-yay-yah crap.
All right, you know the system's put in place
To keep order around here.
You know what, I'm gonna give you some options, okay?
Do you want me to put the hitler mustache
On your glee club picture, or you want the buck teeth
On your glee club picture?
Which one do you want?
It don't matter to me either way.
I'll put...
(grunts)
Hey, how do you spell "loser"?
I'm gonna write it on his forehead.
His big ol' potato head.
You could write a whole haiku on that thing.
(bell rings)
Can we shake a leg here?
Fine.
I'm ready.
I'll...
Do it myself.
(shutter clicks) wait, I...
I insist on only being shot from my left side.
Yeah, I kind of need to see your teeth.
It's sort of my job here.
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm upset.
My co-captain bailed and it just...
I'm sorry, I just need a minute.
Rachel:
Snap out of this.
Stop being defined by what other people think of you,
Or how they disappoint you.
It's lonely at the top, you know that.
What's that song about overcoming
Professional and personal disappointments?
Oh, yeah.
¶ when you're smiling, when you're smiling ¶
¶ the whole world smiles with you. ¶
I'm ready.
Great.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That-that's it?
I practiced over 18 different poses
For this shoot, and I haven't even shown you
Any of my over the left shoulder pose.
See?
Sorry, kid, I got to blow.
I got a casting session in half an hour.
A...
A casting session for what?
My brother-in-law is shooting a commercial for his store.
I'm directing it.
I just do these school photos for the money.
(sobbing)
Uh, uh, okay.
Wait, no, don't...
I can take a couple more pictures for you.
I can cry on demand.
It's one of my many talents.
I'm very versatile,
And aside from nudity and the exploitation of animals,
I'll pretty much do anything to break into the business.
We-well, you certainly seem talented and all,
But I need...
There's other speaking parts in this thing.
I need, like, a bunch of other actors, too.
I can help with that.
I'd like to call this meeting to order.
Oh, hello, finn.
How nice of you to show.
Finn:
Look, I'm sorry.
The guys were harassing me
In the locker room about it.
They said that if I took the glee club photo,
That they'd make me choose between an hitler mustache
Or buck teeth, and I can't rock either of those looks.
Do you think I have a potato head?
Rachel:
Okay, look, I realize now
That all of you think that glee club is just a joke.
Okay, and you're convinced
That we can't win, and you're content to just sit idle by
Until figgins cancels the club.
Well,
I'm about to present to you a rare opportunity.
The opportunity to become stars.
How?
We've all been cast in a local commercial.
Are you serious?
Yes, finn,
And while all of you have been
So concerned with your appearance in this school,
I've landed glee club its first big break.
Simply put,
Making us all celebrities.
Okay, and no one
Messes with celebrities or defaces their pictures.
What's the commercial?
Hold on to your hats and get ready to sell Some mattresses!
(excited chatter)
I'm getting a nice pair of black suspenders.
Simple black.
My mom's going to be really proud.
Let's do our camera face.
I can't believe we're finally breaking into the biz!
You guys, I want us to always remember this moment.
Soon, there may be agents and managers and movie deals,
But right now I want us to remember what it feels like
To be here together as a team.
Whatever.
Soon as I get my record deal,
I'm not speaking to any of you.
(snickering)
Okay, guys, we're very excited to have you here.
We here at mattress land believe that mattresses
Aren't just for sleeping and fornicating anymore.
We believe that buying an affordable mattress
Should be fun.
All right, let's go over the script.
I think it's pretty brilliant.
I wrote it myself.
Action!
(clears throat) "ah, me."
"what's wrong?"
"we just lost our jobs...
"at the factory,
And we can't get a good night's sleep."
Rachel:
"chipper up!
"come on down to mattress land.
"we've got near-wholesale prices
To fit your style and pocketbook."
I-I'm sorry.
Mr. Cusperberg.
This script is brilliant,
But we're a glee club, and we should perform.
Perform the lines as I wrote them.
Wait a minute, dennis.
What did you have in mind?
¶ ba, ba, ba ¶
¶ ba-ba, ba-da ¶

All:
Come on down to mattress land!
Uh...
Terri, have you seen my pocket square?
(sighs)
Terri?
(sighs)
Terri?
A pocket square's gonna make you look like ted knight.
What is this?
It's a pregnancy pad.
They have them at the maternity stores for trying on clothes
So you can see how you're gonna look when you're showing.
Kendra stole it for me so I could see
If any of her old clothes would fit...
Pick up your shirt.
What?
No.
(clattering)
Pick up your shirt.
You're scaring me, will.
Think about what you're accusing me of.
Think about it and turn around and go find your pocket square.
(gasps)
Please?
(gasping breath)
(whimpers)
(gasps)
Why did you do this to us?
I don't understand!
I thought you were leaving me.
You're so different, will.
We both know it.
I can feel you.
You're pulling away from me.
Why, because I-I've started standing up to you?
Trying to make this a relationship of equals?
No, because of the damn glee club.
Ever since you started it,
You just walk around
Like you're better than me!
I should be allowed to feel good about myself!
Who are we kidding, will?
This marriage works because
You don't feel good about yourself.
This marriage works because I love you,
Because I've always accepted you, good and bad.
You loved the girl you met when you were 15.
I'm not that girl.
You've made yourself a stranger to me now.
Are you happy?
Are you satisfied?
!
It didn't start as a lie.
I really thought I was pregnant.
And then the doctor,
He said it was a hysterical pregnancy, and I...
I just panicked!
This is insane.
What were you gonna do when the due date came?
Quinn fabray.
It was so perfect.
She didn't want hers, and I needed one.
I had the doctor use her ultrasound dvd
At your appointment that you came to.
(scoffs)
I loved you, terri.
I really loved you.
I'm so sorry, will.
I'm so sorry.
Do you remember at that appointment?
Do you remember what we said?
That at that moment, no matter what happened,
We loved each other.
We could get that feeling back again.
You could love me back, will!
Please, will!
Please, don't go!
Please, don't go!
Please?
!
Oh, god.
Sue:
Am I asking for too much,
Ohio board of statewide holiday planning?
All I want is just one day a year
Where I'm not visually assaulted by uglies and fatties.
Seriously, ohio, these retinas need a day off.
So here's the dream:
Friday after christmas-- which I have off--
If you're hideous, stay at home.
Spend the entire day watching home videos of a time
When you weren't too repulsive for me
To ever want to look at.
And that's how sue sees it.
Rod.
Slammin', sue.
We'll be right back.
Hey, andrea, that "sue's corner" I just did,
Was talking about you.
(on tv):
¶ go ahead and jump!
¶
Rachel:
Who says finding a mattress can't be fun?
At mattress land,
We have mattresses of all shapes and sizes
At prices that won't break your pocketbook.
No credit?
No problem!
Mattress land has a no-hassle financing
Of 12.9% with no money down and no payments till next year.
You'll jump for joy at our prices.
All:
Come on down to mattress land!
(school bell ringing)
Coach sylvester, we need to talk.
Oh, I got nothing to say to you, prego.
The cheerios' photo's tomorrow, and I want back on that squad.
Oh, is that what you want?
Well, what I wanted was a head cheerleader who wasn't going
To hoist her legs behind her ears in the backseat
Of the first station wagon she could jimmy open,
Throwing away any chance she ever had in life.
It would be good for the school.
Show everyone that appearances don't matter.
That sometimes people have to deal with a little adversity.
I learned that in glee club.
Well, that little educational proverb must have slithered
From will schuester's mouth right after his lesson
On how to disqualify yourselves from sectionals.
What?
Saw your little commercial last night.
Boy, did you glee kids step in it.
Shue, I'm afraid sue is right.
You have indeed stepped in it.
No, I didn't even know this was going on.
Of course, you didn't, william.
You wouldn't know if your glee club was using your office
To breed rabbits for pets or for food.
And you know why?
You're too busy chasing tail and loading your hair
With enormous amounts of product!
I mean, today it just looks like you put lard in it.
What are you even talking about?
!
Look, look, the kids did the commercial
To foster a feeling of unity after you--
Not anyone else-- you got them banned from the yearbook.
That's what I did, yes, I admit it.
It was an innocent mistake.
And what if I were to just innocently murder you, will?
I'd still have to go to trial.
Probably get off with justifiable homicide.
Let me review the rules for you.
William, amendment 63, seventh addendum:
"no professional activity of any kind will be tolerated,
"and payment for services rendered negates amateur status,
Triggering immediate disqualification."
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, keep it civil.
Hey, what, mister?
!
No, keep it simple, folks!
Keep it simple.
Hey, I'm sorry, shue,
But I cannot let this slide.
But the kids weren't even paid!
There's a stack of mattresses in the choir room
Piled as high as the empty hair gel bottles
In the dumpster outside your apartment!
Okay, we'll give the mattresses back.
Shue, one of those mattresses was used.
You can't return a used mattress.
You can't even donate one to charity.
Lice, bedbugs-- I looked it up online!
Is there any reason that you have
A soiled mattress in your office, will?
Have you and the redhead become so sexually depraved
That you have to commit your craven acts of adultery
In between classes?
What?
You know what, okay, fine.
I slept here, all right?
Excuse me?
(sighs)
I'm thinking about leaving my wife.
Well, I didn't see that one coming at all.
William, I am very sorry about your personal troubles
But my hands are tied.
Sue's right-- you broke the rules.
I cannot fight the scholastic board.
I'm sorry but glee club is over.
It's over!
Sue:
"dear journal,
"I've finally gotten will schuester
"and that glee club out of my hair.
"this is a day that will live in infamy.
Once again, I've won."
Miss sylvester.
It's like looking at a porno star in a nun's habit.
I wanted to show you that it still fits.
My baby bump isn't that bad,
It's just like I had a big lunch.
Take it off.
You need to get it through your pregnant head,
There's no way you're getting in that photo
Or back on the cheerios.
End of story.
You're a hypocrite.
Excuse me?
I just heard that you got glee club's
Amateur status revoked over a mattress.
While you are constantly
Showering the cheerios with swag.
I've gotten free shoes,
Complimentary tanning, haircuts.
The season tickets to cedar point--
We sold those on ebay.
For a profit.
It seems to me that if figgins found out,
You would get banned from competition.
Fine.
You're back on the cheerios.
I'll put you on full-time dry cleaning duty
And shove you to the back of the photo to hide your shame.
I'm not finished.
Glee club gets a full page photo.
That's not up to me.
You are giving up one of the cheerios' six pages
And you are giving it to the glee club free of charge.
You know, q, I'd forgotten
Just how ruthless you really are.
You're like a young sue sylvester.
Now, get out of my office.
If you can manage to squeeze through the door
Without your water breaking all over my new carpet.
You know what?
I don't think I want to be a cheerio after all.
I don't want to be on a team where I only appear to belong.
I'd rather be a part of a club that's proud to have me
Like glee club.
(sighing):
It's my fault.
If I hadn't slept on that mattress,
We could've just returned them and moved on.
Hey, can I give you some advice?
Please.
You need to give yourself a break.
(scoffs) you do.
You'll figure out what to do with the kids, you always do.
But I think right now
You really need to focus on your own life.
You know, divorce is a really big deal.
Who said anything about getting a divorce?
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.
I just assumed
That that's...
Is that what you would do?
Well, um...
When I first heard about
What terri had done,
Oh, gosh, no, I thought there should be some sort of law.
But then when I thought
About it some more,
Thought about what I would've done
If I'd felt you slipping away...
You would never be that cruel.
No, her methods were wrong, but, um,
I totally understand her intentions.
You're a lot to lose, will.
But we don't want to go to sectionals without you.
(sighs)
It's without me or not at all.
Look, I was the one who slept on the mattress,
Which means I accepted them, not you.
Which means I'm disqualified from competition,
Not you guys.
He's taking the bullet for us.
Solid.
(sighing):
We have worked too hard
For you guys not to get your shot.
We can't do this without you, mr.
Shue.
Hell, we probably can't do it with you.
That's not true.
You guys are good.
You're really good.
You did "jump" for that commercial without me, right?
Look, the best teachers don't give you the answers.
They just point the way and let you make your own choices.
Your own mistakes.
That way you get all the glory.
And you deserve it.
Look, if...
If you can't win without me there,
Then I haven't done my job.
We're really sorry, mr.
Shue.
I know.
I want you guys to go get gussied up
And take that glee club photo with pride.
I want to see a smile on every one of your faces.

Here's what you missed last week.
Emma and Ken are getting married, though she really likes Will.
If we were gonna rank crush-worthy teachers at this school... you'd be number one with a bullet.
Which Ken's kind of noticed... which makes him really not like Will.
The whole world knows I'm just a consolation prize to you.
How do you think that makes me feel?
- Also, Terri says she's pregnant.
- Wow.
But really she's faking, and Mr. Schuester doesn't know.
This baby's the only reason he's still here.
Will's busy getting the kids ready for sectionals... where they're up against a school for the deaf.
- I can't hear you.
Talk into this ear.
Scarlet fever.
- You're on!
- And a group of juvie girls.
- Aphasia, give Mr. Schuester his wallet back.
But it turns out both of them are really good.
It's like cool epilepsy.
Sue kicked Quinn out of the Cheerios because she's pregnant.
I can't have a pregnant girl on my squad.
- You're a disgrace.
- That's not very nice, but neither is Sue.
Those drinks are crap!
- And that's what you missed on...
- ¶¶ Glee ¶¶
- Hey, guys.
Mind if I join you?
- Hmm.
- So, what's with all the primping?
- Yearbook pictures.
This is the 50th edition of the McKinley High School Thunderclap.
I'm gonna drop 20 pounds by Friday, look smokin' hot for that photo... and be down to a trim 210 for the wedding a week Saturday.
Of course the, um...
the wedding was gonna be in Hawaii... but then they told me I couldn't bring my own fruit.
- So...
- But sectionals is a week from Saturday.
Oh, man.
Looks like you won't be able to make it, MM.
I, um...
I totally forgot about sectionals.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I wanted to go... for the kids.
We are not rescheduling.
The V.F.W. hall is booked till next June.
The only reason this Saturday is available... is 'cause it's the one-year anniversary of that grisly fish-fry shoot-out.
I got a monster discount.
We just got to be out of there before the candlelight vigil.
l-l...
I remember.
Oh, my gosh.
Sue?
Did someone finally punch you?
Edie.
William.
You.
Every year when the photos for the Thunderclap come around...
I always elect to have a little work done.
This year I got myself a bit of an eye lift.
And while they were in there, I told them to go ahead and yank out those tear ducts.
Wasn't using 'em.
You know, I got a storage unit full of trophies and medallions.
But for the rest of you educators... these yearbook pictures are really the only concrete proof you have... that anything you've done in your sorry little lives has made any difference whatsoever.
My Cheerios are so excited.
Got 'em on a yam diet.
Draws the water out of the skin.
Well, I'm sure my Glee kids are gonna be excited too.
- Well, Glee kids don't get a photo.
- What?
- Why is that?
- I just had a meeting with Principal Figgins, Eleanor.
And what with all the vandalism of the Glee Club photos over the years...
I convinced him that putting the Glee kids in this year's Thunderclap... was subjecting the little freaks to more humiliation and ridicule.
Hey, why can't you just accept the fact... that my kids are gonna take sectionals this year?
- That's not happening.
- And stop with the pointless vendetta.
All right, this is so not fair, Sue.
You know, I'm gonna talk to Figgins about this.
Hey, good luck with that.
You know, you three are boring me now.
I'm gonna go do something else.
- Where's Rachel?
- She's not here yet.
Perfect.
Glee Club stands on a delicate precipice.
We have all felt the cold humiliation of a Slushee in the face.
But as of right now, our relative anonymity as a club... shields us from more severe persecution... swirlies, patriotic wedgies.
What's a patriotic wedgie?
It's when they hoist you up the flagpole by your undies.
Strangely, it did make me feel more American.
Based on my investigation, I am of the opinion... that a yearbook photo would only fuel the flames of anti-Glee Club terror.
I've done a little library research.
Peter Geller...
Glee Club second tenor, 1998.
He can be seen here with both a drawn-on Hitler mustache and a rice paddy hat.
Shortly after the yearbook came out, Mr. Geller had a nervous breakdown.
He's now the homeless man who sleeps in front of the public library.
- Patches?
- Patches.
- He barks at my mom.
- Exhibit "B."
Tawny Peterson.
Glee Club class of 2000.
Seen here in her photo with a cartoon knife stuck in her head... in a macabre tableau that in four years would prove eerily prescient.
I think I speak for all of us when I say... that not having to pose for a yearbook photo might be a blessing in disguise.
I suggest not fighting Figgins's ruling.
Oh, hey, guys.
Ah, looking at old Thunderclaps?
- It's really unsettling.
- And totally unfair.
Hey, can I borrow one of these?
You know what?
This year's Thunderclap is gonna have a Glee Club photo... with every one of your smiling faces.
You have my word on it.
Schue, I'm doing the Glee Club a solid.
We're denying the opportunity to other children to further humiliate them.
No, no, no.
Those kids get up on stage all the time... no matter what anyone thinks of them...
and they perform.
They don't let anyone or anything get to them.
That's something you should encourage.
Sue is wrong.
- Fine.
I'll give them a photo.
- Thank you.
- For $1,000.
- What?
That's what it costs.
The yearbook is prime advertising space, Schue.
Frederickson's Funeral Parlor experienced a 1.3% increase in revenue... after their full-page ad last year in the Thunderclap.
Okay, um...
What about a quarter page?
How much does that cost?
$325.
That will buy you enough space for a photo of two members of the Glee Club... right below the advertisement for Uncle Sandro's Chicken Inside of a Waffle.
- Figgins, that's a lot of money.
- It's a compromise, Schue.
Now, I suggest you select the good-looking cheerleader... not the pregnant one... and the quarterback for the photo... as their faces are less likely to be scratched out with safety pins.
Mr. Schuester, I'm very sorry to interrupt.
Principal Figgins, as you very well may know, this is my first year in Glee Club... and I've just been informed that New Directions has not been afforded a yearbook photo.
As you might expect, my two gay dads have a very close relationship...
- with our local branch of the A.C.L. U...
- Beat you to the punch, Rachel.
It's all good.
We're in the yearbook.
Oh.
Fantastic.
Thank you so much.
Make fun of me all you want, but school pictures are everything to me.
They're great practice for getting photographed by the paparazzi.
Invasive as the press may be, stars are dependent on them for their fame... and I feel I must be prepared.
In order to do so, I join every club I possibly can.
I know you're thinking that I'm just joining all these clubs... to give off the appearance that I'm involved, known to exist.
But Glee Club is different.
I really love Glee.
And I believe in what we stand for.
We've come from behind...
dismissed and ridiculed by everyone.
And we've made something of ourselves...
something that I'm proud to be a part of... something I want to be remembered for.
I miss my Cheerios uniform.
It made me feel safe, contained.
Even when I was feeling left out... at least I looked like I was a part of something.
I want my kids to be able to look back at these books and see who I was... make them proud.
Not the bastard one I'm carrying now, of course.
The ones I'll have when I'm married and ready.
I might not look like the head cheerleader anymore... but I'm still her on the inside.
Hmm.
I'm done playing the victim.
When that cheerleading picture is taken for the yearbook...
I'm gonna be in it and back on the squad... whether Sue Sylvester likes it or not.
Hey, baby, which one of these ties goes better with my shirt?
- You're blocking the TV, Will.
- Oh, come on.
I need your help.
- School pictures are coming up.
- Oh.
Well, in that case, um...
Wear the red one for the teacher photo and the green one for the Glee Club.
It'll pop more when the cool kids deface it.
Yeah.
I, uh...
I wanted to talk to you about that.
So Figgins stopped putting the Glee Club photo in the yearbook... because it always gets vandalized and...
I just feel so bad for the kids.
I mean, they work so hard.
They deserve to be recognized.
Not being in that book gives the appearance that Glee Club isn't important.
I wanna buy an ad and use it as the Glee Club photo spread.
It's around $300.
Oh, great.
Why don't you take the food out of the refrigerator and just give that to the kids?
Will, that food goes from my mouth right into our baby's belly.
We have a couple hundred bucks left over from selling the Blue Bomber II.
- The answer's no, Will.
No.
- But if we...
No.
No.
No.
Actually, can you wait to cash that until Thursday?
Kurt, I have a fantastic idea for a club... that would officially make me the most involved student in the whole school.
I want us to start a "Gay Lesb All."
- I'm sorry?
- The Gay Lesbian Alliance.
"Gay Lesb All."
Hey, guys, great news.
Glee Club gets a photo in the Thunderclap.
- Uh-huh.
- Whoo!
It's gonna show everyone at the school that Glee Club is on its way up.
When we win regionals, those Claps are going to be collector's items.
All of your classmates are going to be begging for your autographs.
But I had to compromise to do it.
Um, we only get a quarter page in back... which means we have to pick two team captains to appear in the photo.
So tomorrow we're gonna put it to a vote.
- Exciting, huh?
All right.
- Yeah!
- Well, we're all here.
I guess we should vote.
- With your permission...
I have prepared a few words.
- I nominate Rachel.
- Second.
All right, let's vote up in this piece.
I got to go hit the gym and load up the "Guns of Puckerone" for the football picture.
Looks like everybody voted for Rachel.
Including Rachel.
- But we need two captains, guys.
- Why two?
We're fine with having Rachel represent us in the Thunderclap by herself.
We'd actually prefer it.
The worst part is that after all this time, they're still embarrassed to be in Glee Club.
They still see themselves as losers.
I just need to get one of them to step up and become co captain.
Well, maybe you should let them use the captain they already elected.
You know, sometimes things sound a lot different coming from a peer... even if that peer is as annoying as Rachel.
None of this is gonna matter if they win at sectionals.
I'm really sorry I can't be there.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.
I-I kind of think Ken scheduled your wedding the same day on purpose... you know, so... so you couldn't go.
Why would he do that?
Come on.
We-We both know how he feels about our... relationship.
I'm marrying Ken, Will.
Look, I know that I've...
I've definitely given him reason in the past to be jealous.
But I need you to know that I'm done with that now.
Ken has a lot of flaws.
He has 74 flaws as of yesterday.
But you know what?
He's not vindictive.
He's actually a very good man.
He is kind, and he is great with the students here at McKinley.
We have that in common.
And yes, it's true his hygiene could be a lot better.
But he is absolutely full of compassion, and...
Well, that is why I'm marrying him.
You're right.
I was out of line.
It won't happen again.
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Schue?
- Oh, yeah, Rach.
Sit down.
So, how's the new captaincy going?
I-I think that my unanimous election gave me a very strong mandate...
- to shake things up.
- Great.
Well...
I have a job for you, Captain.
We need a co captain.
But you have so many great ideas... no reason you shouldn't have some help pushing them through.
I could use a trusty lieutenant.
I do have over 65 proposals.
So... can I count on you?
No problem.
I'm on it.
Um, I can't be co captain.
No time.
Kwanzaa.
Kwanzaa's late December, Mercedes.
The photo's this Thursday.
Yeah.
I'm prepping early this year.
¶¶ Well, you might think I'm crazy ¶¶
I'd love to be in the photo, Rachel.
But you'd be standing and I'd be sitting.
It would throw off the whole composition.
I'll lean over.
But if you lean over... it'll look like you have stomach rolls.
¶¶ But I think that you're wild ¶¶¶¶
On second thought, I don't think that you're leadership material, Artie.
Follower.
Brittany, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
- No way.
- Why not?
I don't wanna be in a picture with you.
It'll get defaced.
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it will.
I'll be the one doing it.
I'm desperate.
Glee Club needs you, Finn.
I'm totally honored you asked me... but don't you think you should pick somebody who cares more?
Not that I don't.
But I just have football and friends and stuff.
Glee Club only started working after you joined.
Face it, we wouldn't have all of the cheerleaders and football players in the club... if it wasn't for you.
You know I love Glee Club.
I just don't know why I have to represent it.
Because you're a leader, Finn.
And that's what leaders do.
They stick their necks out for people that they care about.
There are stakes here.
Morale is low.
You know it.
If things don't change, we're not even gonna place at sectionals... and then the club is over.
- I can't do this alone.
- You don't have to.
I am a leader.
It's who I am, who I wanna be.
You got yourself a co captain.
I'll do the picture with you.
I totally understand that as captain of the football team... you've worked really hard to project an appearance of steely toughness.
But Glee Club is different.
We have to present the appearance of positivity and optimism.
So... we're gonna practice... and I'm gonna teach you how to smile correctly for your photo.
¶¶ When you first left me I was wanting more ¶¶
¶¶ You were kissing that girl next door ¶¶
- ¶¶ What you do that for ¶¶ - ¶¶ What you do that for ¶¶

What the hell?
Hey, man.
Shh.
We're practicing, dude.
Chill out.
We heard you were gonna be in the Glee Club photo...
- and we don't wanna mess up messing it up.
- Screw you, Karofsky!
I'm sick of you pulling people down!
Hey, man, don't talk that kumbayeyah crap.
All right, you know this system's put in place to keep order around here.
Hey, you know what?
Look, I'm gonna give you some options, okay?
You want me to put the Hitler mustache on your Glee Club picture... or do you want the buck teeth on your Glee Club picture?
Which one you want?
Man, it don't matter to me either way.
I'll put both of...
Hey, how do you spell "loser"?
I'm gonna write it on his forehead.
His big ol' potato head.
You can write a whole haiku on that thing.
Can we shake a leg here?
Fine.
I'm ready.
I'll...
do it myself.
Wait.
I...
I insist on only being shot from my left side.
Yeah, I kind of need to see your teeth.
It's sort of my job here.
I'm sorry.
I'm just...
I'm upset.
My co captain bailed, and it just...
I just need a minute.
Snap out of this.
Stop being defined by what other people think of you... or how they disappoint you.
It's lonely at the top.
You know that.
What's that song about overcoming professional and personal disappointments?
Oh, yeah.
¶¶ When you're smiling ¶¶
¶¶ When you're smiling ¶¶
¶¶ The whole world smiles with you ¶¶¶¶
I'm ready.
Great.
Wait, wait, wait.
That-That's it?
I practiced over 18 different poses for this shoot... and I haven't even shown you any of my over-the-left-shoulder poses, see?
Sorry, kid.
I got to blow.
I got a casting session in half an hour.
A...
A casting session for what?
My brother-in-law is shooting a commercial for his store.
I'm directing it.
I just do these school photos for the money.
Uh, wa-wa...
Okay.
Wait.
No.
Don't.
I can take a couple more pictures for you.
I can cry on demand.
It's one of my many talents.
I'm very versatile.
And aside from nudity and the exploitation of animals...
I'll pretty much do anything to break into the business.
W-Well, you certainly seem talented and all... but I-I need...
There's other speaking parts in this thing.
I need, like, a bunch of other actors too.
I can help with that.
I'd like to call this meeting to order.
Hello, Finn.
How nice of you to show.
Look, I'm sorry.
The guys were harassing me in the locker room about it.
If I took the Glee Club photo, they'd make me choose between a Hitler mustache or buck teeth.
And I can't rock either of those looks.
Do you think I have a potato head?
Look, I realize now that all of you think that Glee Club is just a joke.
Okay?
And you're convinced that we can't win... and you're content to just sit idle by until Figgins cancels the club.
Well, I'm about to present to you a rare opportunity... the opportunity to become... stars.
How?
We've all been cast in a local commercial.
Are you serious?
Yes, Finn.
And while all of you have been so concerned with your appearance in this school...
I've landed Glee Club its first big break.
Simply put, making us all celebrities.
Okay, and no one messes with celebrities or defaces their pictures.
- What's the commercial?
- Hold on to your hats and get ready to sell... some mattresses.
Awesome.
I'm gonna get a nice pair of black suspenders.
My mom's gonna be really proud.
Let's do our camera face.
I can't believe we're finally breaking into the biz.
You guys, I want us to always remember this moment.
Soon there may be agents and managers and movie deals.
But right now I want us to remember what it feels like to be here together as a team.
Whatever.
As soon as I get my record deal, I'm not speaking to any of you.
Okay, guys, we're very excited to have you here.
We here at Mattress Land believe... that mattresses aren't just for sleeping and fornicating anymore.
We believe that buying an affordable mattress should be fun.
All right, let's go over the script.
I think it's pretty brilliant.
I wrote it myself.
Action.
Ah, me.
- What's wrong?
- We just lost our jobs... at the factory.
And we can't get a good night's sleep.
Chipper up!
Come on down to Mattress Land!
We've got near wholesale prices to fit your style and pocketbook.
I'm-I'm sorry.
Mr. Casperberg... this script is brilliant.
But we're a glee club, and we should perform.
Perform the lines as I wrote them.
Wait a minute, Dennis.
What did you have in mind?

Come on down to Mattress Land!
Come on down to Mattress Land!
Terri, have you seen my pocket square?
Terri?
- Terri.
- A pocket square's gonna make you look like Ted Knight.
What is this?
It's a pregnancy pad.
They have them at the maternity stores for trying on clothes... so you can see how you're gonna look when you're showing.
Kendra stole it for me so I can see if any of her old clothes would fit...
Pick up your shirt.
What?
No.
- Pick up your shirt.
- You're scaring me, Will.
Now, think about what you're accusing me of.
Think about it and turn around and go find your pocket square.
Please.
Why did you do this to us?
I don't understand.
I thought you were leaving me.
You're so different, Will.
We both know it.
I can feel you.
You're pulling away from me.
Because I've started standing up to you, trying to make this a relationship of equals?
No, because of the damn Glee Club.
Ever since you started it, you just walk around like you're better than me.
I should be allowed to feel good about myself.
Who are we kidding, Will?
This marriage works because you don't feel good about yourself.
This marriage works because I love you...
- because I've always accepted you.
- No.
- Good and bad.
- You love the girl you met when you were 15.
- I'm not that girl.
- You've made yourself a stranger to me now.
- No.
- Are you happy?
Are you satisfied?
It didn't start as a lie.
I really thought I was pregnant.
And then the doctor, he said it was a hysterical pregnancy... and I just panicked.
This is insane.
I mean, wh-what were you gonna do when the due date came?
Quinn Fabray.
It was so perfect.
She didn't want hers, and I needed one.
I had the doctor use her ultrasound DVD... at your appointment that you came to.
I loved you, Terri.
- I really loved you.
- I'm so sorry, Will.
I'm so sorry.
Do you remember that appointment?
Do you remember what we said?
That at that moment, no matter what happened, we loved each other.
We can get that feeling back again.
You can love me back, Will.
Please, Will.
Please don't go.
Please don't go!
Please!
Oh, God.
Am I asking for too much...
Ohio Board of Statewide Holiday Planning?
All I want is just one day a year... where I'm not visually assaulted by uglies and fatties.
Seriously, Ohio, these retinas need a day off.
So here's the dream.
Friday after Christmas, which I have off... if you're hideous, stay at home.
Spend the entire day watching home videos... of a time when you weren't too repulsive for me to ever wanna look at.
At that's how Sue sees it.
- Rod.
- Slammin' , Sue.
We'll be right back.
Hey, Andrea, that "Sue's Corner"I just did...
I was talking about you.
¶¶ Go ahead and jump ¶¶
Who says finding a mattress can't be fun?
At Mattress Land, we have mattresses of all shapes and sizes... at prices that won't break your pocketbook.
No credit?
No problem.
Mattress Land has a no-hassle financing of 12.9%... with no money down and no payments till next year.
You'll jump for joy at our prices.
Come on down to Mattress Land!
Coach Sylvester, we need to talk.
Oh, I got nothing to say to you, preggo.
The Cheerios photo's tomorrow, and I want back on that squad.
Oh, is that what you want?
Well, what I wanted was a head cheerleader... who wasn't going to hoist her legs behind her ears... in the back seat of the first station wagon she could jimmy open... throwing away any chance she ever had in life.
It would be good for the school... show everyone that appearances don't matter.
Sometimes people have to deal with a little adversity.
I learned that in Glee Club.
Well, that little educational proverb... must have slithered from Will Schuester's mouth... right after his lesson on how to disqualify yourselves from sectionals.
- What?
- Saw your little commercial last night.
Boy, did you Glee kids step in it.
Schue, I'm afraid Sue is right.
You have indeed stepped in it.
- I didn't even know this was going on.
- Of course you didn't, William.
You wouldn't know if your Glee Club was using your office... to breed rabbits for pets or for food.
You know why?
You're too busy chasing tail... and loading your hair with enormous amounts of product.
Today it just looks like you put lard in it.
What are you even talking about?
Look...
Look, the kids did the commercial to foster a feeling of unity... after you... not anyone else...
you got them banned from the yearbook.
- That's what I did, yes.
- It was an innocent mistake.
And what if I were to just innocently murder you, Will?
I'd still have to go to trial.
Probably get off with justifiable homicide.
Let me review the rules for you.
- This is crazy.
- Amendment 63, seventh addendum.
"No professional activity of any kind will be tolerated...
"and payment for services rendered negates amateur status...
- triggering immediate disqualification."
- Hey.
Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Keep it civil.
Keep it simple.
- Hey what, mister?
Keep it simple.
Hey, I am sorry, Schue, but I cannot let this slide.
But the kids weren't even paid.
There's a stack of mattresses in the choir room... piled as high as the empty hair gel bottles...
- in the Dumpster outside your apartment.
- We'll give the mattresses back.
Schue, one of those mattresses was used.
You can't return a used mattress.
You can't even donate one to charity.
Lice.
Bedbugs.
I looked it up online.
Is there any reason that you have a soiled mattress in your office, Will?
Have you and the redhead become so sexually depraved... that you have to commit your craven acts of adultery in between classes?
- Wha...
- I slept...
You know, okay, fine.
I slept here, all right?
Excuse me?
I'm thinking about leaving my wife.
Oh, I didn't see that one coming at all.
William, I am very sorry about your personal troubles, but my hands are tied.
Sue's right.
You broke the rules.
I cannot fight the scholastic board.
I'm sorry, but Glee Club is over.
It's over.
Dear Journal...
I've finally gotten Will Schuester and that Glee Club out of my hair.
This is a day that will live in infamy.
Once again, I've won.
Miss Sylvester.
It's like looking at a porno star in a nun's habit.
I wanted to show you that it still fits.
My baby bump isn't that bad.
It's just like I had a big lunch.
Take it off.
You need to get it through your pregnant head... there's no way you're getting in that photo or back on the Cheerios... end of story.
- You're a hypocrite.
- Excuse me?
I just heard that you got Glee Club's amateur status revoked over a mattress... while you are constantly showering the Cheerios with swag.
I've gotten free shoes, complimentary tanning, haircuts.
The season tickets to Cedar Point?
We sold those on eBay.
For a profit.
It seems to me that if Figgins found out... you would get banned from competition.
Fine.
You're back on the Cheerios.
I'll put you on full-time dry-cleaning duty... and shove you to the back of the photo to hide your shame.
I'm not finished.
Glee Club gets a full-page photo.
- It's not up to me.
- You are giving up... one of the Cheerios' six pages... and you are giving it to the Glee Club free of charge.
You know, Q. I'd forgotten... just how ruthless you really are.
You're like a young Sue Sylvester.
Now get out of my office... if you can manage to squeeze through the door without your water breaking... all over my new carpet.
You know what?
I don't think I wanna be a Cheerio after all.
I don't wanna be on a team where I only appear to belong.
I'd rather be a part of a club that's proud to have me... like Glee Club.
It's my fault.
If I hadn't slept on that mattress... we could have just returned them and moved on.
- Hey, can I give you some advice?
- Please.
You need to give yourself a break.
You do.
You'll...
You'll figure out what to do with the kids.
You always do.
But I think right now you really need to focus on your own life.
You know, divorce is a really big deal.
Who said anything about getting a divorce?
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I just assumed that that's...
Is that what you would do?
Well, um...
When I first heard about what Terri had done...
I thought there should be some sort of law.
But then when I thought about it some more...
I thought about what I would have done... if I'd felt you slipping away.
You would never be that cruel.
You know, her methods were wrong.
But, um...
I totally understand her intentions.
You're a lot to lose, Will.
But we don't wanna go to sectionals without you.
It's without me or not at all.
Look, I was the one who slept on the mattress... which means I accepted them, not you.
Which means I'm disqualified from competition.
- Not you guys.
- He's taking the bullet for us.
Solid.
We have worked too hard for you guys not to get your shot.
We can't do this without you, Mr. Schue.
- Hell, we probably can't do it with you.
- That's not true.
You guys are good.
You're really good.
Y-Y-You did "Jump" for that commercial without me, right?
Look... the best teachers don't give you the answers.
They just point the way and let you make your own choices... your own mistakes.
That way, you get all the glory.
And you deserve it.
But if... if you can't win without me there... then I haven't done my job.
We're really sorry, Mr. Schue.
I know.
I want you guys to go get gussied up... and take that Glee Club photo with pride.
I wanna see a smile on every one of your faces.

Previously on 90210...
I'm the guy that hit you.
It was totally my fault.
You know, the important thing is that we're both all right.
Navid, I'm not really asking you for anything.
Odod, 'cause i-i don't know if I can do anything
Or be anything to you.
I reserved a hotel suite; aying there
-Until mom comes home. -hey, everyone.
I have something to anncounced I'm pregnant
- Christin hey, - nika.
I'd like you to meet navid.
Hi. what's up?
This being in love stuff
Is making me crazy.
- You love me?
- I do.
What is this about?
I'm just trying to get to know you.
The accident, it changed things.
I mean, I feel like it woke me up or something,
Like it jolted me out of my bubble.
The bubble that I'm still in.
Coming.
Morning, aaron.
Good morning, ms. clark.
Have a nice da
Fashion section?
Always.
Your car is waiting, ms. clark
Thank you.
Morning, troy.
You're not robert.
Picked up his morning shift.
Hope you're not disappointed, naomi.
How do you know my name?
Oh, robert told me to expect you.
Although...
I wasn't expecting you.
Vanilla skim latte.
Extra foam.
Don't walk away from me
When I'm talking to you!
Hey!
I am talking to you.
I said I want a bloody scotch.
I'm sorry, sir.
The bar doesn't open until 10:00.
Do you know who I am?
!
Let me tell you this slow, right,
So you can understand my english
Get me a scotch!
Or I'll call ins and get you shipped back to mexico
Faster than you y "burrito." how's that?
Excuse me.
Small problem.
What?
Well, just that it'd be odd
If you tried to send miguel here
Back to mexico since he's fm m guatemala.
Unless you meant send him on vavacation,
Which would actually be a nice thing to do,
Considering he works hard
And has to do with drunks like you all day.
You looking for an ass kicking, sunshine?
No, not particularly.
What the hell are you doing?
What--
Get off!
do you know who I am?
!
Hey!
what-what are you--
Get off me!
Hey, babe.
You weren't supposed to see that.
Oh, all right, i...
I didn't see it.
But good choice on the red rose.
It definitely brings out my eyes.
And I love your eyes.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I love hearing that.
I love saying it.
I love being in it.
I mean, it's like everything is different now.
I feel different now.
Oh, this morning on the radio, they played whitney houston.
First time I ever heard her and she didn't sound i like
Some big sappy goober I i wanted to strangle.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Because...
I will always love you.
Always.
Always love you.
Well, you know, you're being
A big cheesy goober right no t too.
Yeah, well, I'm your big cheesy goober, okay?
All right, so...
What?
So you're still not gonna tell me anything about
Our mysterious valentine's plans, huh?
If I tell you it won't be mysterious.
Oh, all right, whitney, do your thing.
Do your thing. uh-huh.
Souhuh, I could pick you up around 8:00
If youanant to just grab dinner before the dance.
I can't.
I actually, uh, got to
The acting intensive that I signed up for.
So I'll be there until 9:00, if you want to pick me up then.
Sure.
Uh, you didn't tell myoyou got in.
Why not?
Yeah, um, well, it's just,
It's kind of hard to talk to you about acting
Without you thinking that acting's all I talk about.
Um, I said that I'm sorry about that.
Yeah, I know.
But you think it's trite, and so it's kind f difficult for me to...
Hey, hang on one minute, okay?
Yeah.
Sure.
What's their deal anyway?
You know, they-they talk
About deep things.
But I swear, if I had to hear about how the accident
Changed everything one more time,
I may actually drive into a tree myself.
Okay. well, you just let me know before you do that,
So I'm not in the car.
I just want her to get better already.
Maybe then, he won't have to hang out with her so much.
Hey, rhonda. morning.
How are you feeling?
A little achy, but okay.
Sorry you couldn't come to the documentary with us last night.
Oh, yeah, I had play practice.
But, uh, was it any good?
Amazing.
It was all just about how
One momoment can change things forever.
Which is so true
I mean, the accident profoundly changed me.
Ethan, too.
I mean, he used to like action movies,
But now he likes documentaries.
Yeah, i-i think she means changes on the inside.
Yeah, I know.
I-i was just kidding.
All right, well,
We should go to class.
Yeah.
I'll see you guys later.
See ya.
Okay, maybe you should drive into a tree.
It was probably some dude in rehab.
Bet navid knows.
Hi ?
what's up?
Oh, yeah, navid knows everything. what's up?
So who's adrianna's baby daddy?
Oh, yeah, I don't even know that.
Could be anyone.
I have no idea.
Man, you dodged a bullet, huh?
Oh, ahah, totally, man.
I mean, adrianna's a mess.
I don't even know
What I was thinking, seriously.
I mean, she has her own thing going on.
I'm not even gonna worry about.
Yeah, me neither.
No "b"
Time for rososes.
Okay, so .Megan
And here's one
For you, michael.
Nika, here you go.
Another one for megan.
Joanna.
One for maya.
And adrianna.
Oh, honey.
I'm getting pity flowers from the faculty.
I mean, I thought they only did that
With the 12th grader in the full body cast.
Scoliosis girl?
I think she has a boyfriend now.
Of course she does.
Hey, are you okay?
I guess for a second I thought it might be something romantic.
I don't know why.
I mean, obviously, I'm not anybody's idea
Of a great valentine's date.
I mean, look at me.
For the record, you look great.
You have super boobage going on, crazy thick hair,
The dewy, glowlolook that's all the rage on the runway,
You've got it.
If I were going to the island of lesbos,
You'd be my pick.
Thank you.
Ethan.
Oh, my gosh.
You waited?
I was going over my essay with mr. matthews for
At least a half an hour.
It's lunch; aren't you starving
Yeah, but, I mean, what are a few hunger pains
Compared to what you're going through?
Which is all because of me.
So let's face it, I owe you.
Right?
but let's go before
They run out of pizza and we get stuck with
That brown stuff they pass off as meat loaf.
Ethan, wait.
There's something I have to tell you.
I-i just don't know
How to tell you without coming off
Like some kind of crazy woman.
Which-which I'm not.
I-i swear.
What is it?
Um...
I'm...
Feeling better than I've been letting on.
A lot better.
I've been exaggerating my injuries.
I can carry my own bag.
What?
I really liked spending time with you,
And I just thought that if I was better,
That you wouldn't want to hang out anymore.
It-it doesn't matter.
I'm sorry I took advantage of you.
You're officially off the hook.
What hook?
We're friends.
Just because of some car accident...
Who cares how we met?
The point is, we did.
And being in an accident
Affected us both, and we get each other.
More than that,
We like each other.
At least, that's what I thought.
I don't know, maybe-maybe you're getting
- Sick of me or something.
- No.
- I-i'm not.
- Okay.
Good.
But we have to be honest with each other from now on.
'cause life's too short for dishonesty.
I completely agree.
I wonder where ethan is.
Probably off discovering the meaning I life.
All righ you got to help me.
I have to plan this unique
Valentine's plan.
I I told you, just go to the dance.
No. everybody's gonna go to the dance.
Take dixon on meme romantic valentine's dinner.
The boy loves food.
Yeah, but hasn't he been on
A romantic valentine's dinner before?
Yeah, but not in l.a.
And-and trust me,
The scene here is way different
Than the all-you-can-eat
Hot wings place in kansas.
- I'm gonna get another drink. you want one?
- uh-uh.
Excuse you!
Excuse you!
I have something
Th's's gonna help you feel better.
Tell me it's the portobello quiche I dreamt about last night.
Voil?
Enjoy.
This almost have stalled the valentine pain.
You know, I've eaten the most amazing places in the world,
And nothing comes close to the restaurant at my hotel.
I guess that's why there's, like, a billion cebrbrities
Swarming there all the time.
Oh, my god, you should see
The valentine's day menu they have.
Yeah?
It's beyond.
Lucky you.
Of course, I don't have a date to go with to the restaurant.
And why, almost before we've even begun to live,
Become dull and gray and apathetic
And lazy and useless and unhappy.
Unhappy because I am nothing.
Excellent.
And that's what I'm talking about.
That is it. that's it.
Okay, who's next?
Um, all right, how about you?
Yeah.
Hi. um, I'm annie wilson.
And I will be doing fantine's monologue
From les miserable.
Ah, good monologue. desperate monologue.
A lot of pain and anguish in the class tonight.
Monsieur javert, i-i-i beseech your mercy.
I assure you that I had done nothing wrong.
If you had been there to see it in the beginning,
- Then you would have seen...
- No, no. stop.
Um, annie, this, this woman is desperate.
Honey, you got to delve into your soul.
You gotta, you gotta reach into your own desperation.
Bring that out, okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
And I swear by the good of god that I'm not to blame.
Go deeper.
That, that gentleman,
The bourgeois whom I did not know,
Put snow in my back!
Annie, thas just louder.
Has anyone the right...?
You are about to lose
Ererything.
...to put snow down our backs,
While we are walking along peaceably...
Where's your soul?
To...
Annie,
Annie, come here.
You are about to lose your freedom and your child.
Perhaps you've never experienced something
Of that magnitude in your life,
But surely there is some painful memory
That you can draw on, some...
- You know?
- Yes, yes.
Then go there, please.
Take your time.
I am rather ill, as you see,
And he had said these impertinent things to me...
O-okay.
That's enough. that's enough.
Thank you.
Just, let's get some, somebody else up there.
You're fine.
Thanks.
Why are there sugar hearts in my waffle?
I think, uh, nat got a little carried away
With the valentine's theme.
Is everything okay?
Sure, fine.
Come on. what's wrong?
Um, problems in the middle east.
Significant things like that.
Annie...
Look, it doesn't matter.
I just want to put it out of my head
And enjoy valentine's day with the boy that I love.
And rhonda?
Oh, um, I'm sorry. uh, she, she's early.
Early for what?
Miss, as I told you over the phone,
We're completely booked.
It's valentine's day.
I know that.
Which is why r really need to get in.
I want to take my boyfriend out for a special dinner,
And your restaurant is the best.
Which is why people make reservations months in aanance.
Months a ago, I didn't know about valentine's day!
No, I meant...
Okay, I knew it existed...
Look, I really wish I could help you.
Fine.
I understand.
Thank you for your patience.
Take your ten dollars back, please.
Come on!
Restaura..
Certainly. tonight?
And what time would you like to dine?
Uh, hello?
what's that about?
Excuse me one second.
We keep a small number of tables reserved for hotel guests
Now if you'll excuse me.
So, uh, what are you two crazy kids gonna get up to
While I'm off being tortured by my new acting teacher?
Um, probably just gonna go shopping.
For what?
- Clothes.
- School supplies.
I, uh...
I asked rhonda to, uh, help me find you
A valentine's present.
Trying to brchch out from the stuffed pentapus thing.
I feel very stupid.
I should get going pretty soon, anyway,
But I assume I'll see you you at the dance?
Oh, i-i don't really do dances.
How come
I just had a really bad experience at one.
What happened?
Maybe she doesn't want to talk about it, ethan.
No, I do.
I mean, I don't,
But I should if we're being honest with each other, right?
Okay, so, at my old school
There was a bunch of girls,
I call them mean girls
But they were so much worse than that.
It felt like their sole purpose in life was just to pick on me.
Anyway, so there was this end-of-the-year dance,
And this guy danny asked me out.
And I was shock.
I mean, I had a huge crush on him.
So my mom and I went shopping,
And we found this dress, and it was
Blue and gauzy and it just,
It reminded me of water, of waves.
And I went to the dance
And went looking for danny.
And I fod d him standing with those girls.
And as soon as they saw me, they just...
They all started to laugh.
And one of the girls threw danny a hundred-dollar bill.
Because apparently, the whole thing was just a dare.
I felt so humiliated.
And so I took all my mom's sleeping pills.
Luckily,
My mom found me in time, and, um,and we moved here.
I am so sorry, rhonda.
I've never told anybody that story before.
Well, I'm glad you told us.
Yeah, I am too.
What..
Do you want?
I need reservations downstairs for dinner tonight
And they are completely booked unless you're a guest
At the hotel, which I'm not, you are,
And I wouldn't ask except it's valentine's day.
Valentine's day...
A holiday you once referred to as "the greeting card mafia's
Stranglehold on the brainless and sentimental."
Well, I know, but look..
I've never been in love before.
You... in love?
Yeah. and I want tonight to be perfect.
It has to be perfect.
And I know that here are no reasons for you
To do any favors for me, and we are not exactly friends
Or even frenemies for that matter,
But we were friends at one point, and i...
Look, when we were 12,
I wrote a book report for you on the pearl
And you said that you owed me one, and I never collected,
And I want to collect now. please?
Larry, hi, darling, it's naomi.
Can you do me a favor?
I have a friend
Who needs a reservation for two tonight at 8:00.
Oh, thank you.
Ah!
you're wonderful. bye now.
Just make sure you preorder the molten chocolate cake.
They cook it while you're eating.
That's the best part of the meal.
sounds good.
Can I buy you a drink or something to thank you?
So we should sit by the pool.
There's a really nice view.
Actually, it sometimes gets chilly out there
Do you want to just sit at the bar?
Sure.
I'll be right with you guys.
Thanks.
Well, the view isn't bad here either, huh?
Just don't mention we're in high school.
Oh, okay.
I am on it.
So I said to my supervisor at the airline,
"do not talk to me like that again,
Or I will quit and take my skills elsewhere, I will."
Hey, naomi.
See, that's not fair. you knowy my name,
But I don't know yours.
Leo. so what can I get you two?
I'll have a sparkling water.
Trying to avoid the hard stuff
Till I go back over the pond.
I'll just have a chamomile tea, thanks.
What was that?
English accents always make people sound older.
in what world?
I can't stop now.
Okay, but less is more.
- You got it, mate. - seriously.
- Cheerio. - all right...
One sparkling water,
One chamomile tea.
Thank you. and I do appreciate that, I do.
Sure thing. honey?
Well, you're awfully forward, aren't you?
For your tea.
Honey?
Oh, righ
No thank you.
So you're new here.
yeah, just moved to l.a.
With your... girlfriend?
Well, if I had a girl,
I wouldn't be flirting with your friend here.
Excuse me, sir.
- Can we get another round?
- I got to get back to work.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hi.
What are you, uh...
Wow, what a coincidence.
Yeah.
Wait, uh, adrianna,
Um, I just wanted
To apologize for what happened by the lockers yesterday.
- It's fine. - no, no, no, it's not fine.
I was a jerk and I'm sorry.
It's just, the guys were talking
And nika was there, and...
I didn't want to make her feel bad.
But I ended up making you feel bad, which--
Which is the last thing I wanted to do.
Look, it's a weird situation all around.
Trust me, I get it.
Right.
Well, the next time anybody says
Anything, okay,
I'm gonna...
Shut 'em down. navid-style, okay?
- Yeah, and what exactly does that entail?
- I don't know.
I'll let you know when I have that
- Figured out. - okay.
Hopefully, I'll have it
Worked out by the dance tonight.
Well, no rush-
- I'm not going.
Sorry to bring up the dance.
Now everything's even more awkward.
No, it's, it's not.
I'm really happy you met someone else.
I really am.
You're such a special guy.
You deserve to have fun, and to go to dances
And just...
Just be normal.
And normal is not really where I'm at right now.
Um, ooh, make sure that you get nika the butter crunch truffles, 'cause there's really nothing like them
In the entire world.
- Truffles?
- she'll love them.
All right.
Okay.
Have fun eating your chocolate.
Happy valentine's day.
Yeah, you, too.
you know, right?
that's what I thought.
I mean, this is nice, but it's not "wow,"
And I'm really going for "wow," or anything better than "wow."
Is there even a word that's better than "wow"?
Here, wear these.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, come here!
thank you!
Okay, hugging me over shoes--
Seriously, what has has gotten into you, silver?
You're a completely diffenent person.
It's the love, man.
I'm telling you, it changes things.
It's like I see the world as this whole better place.
And, naomi, I never thought that I could feel like this.
Well, I'm glad you found somnene who makes you this happy.
Plus, it's been kind of cool us hanging out again.
It has, hasn't it?
So, okay, what are you going to do about hotty bartender?
Oh...
Oh, oh, okay, wait.
You've got to ask him for a date tonight for valentine's day.
Well, it's not like I have any other plans, but...
Oh, well, no, his shift just ended.
I think he said he was going home.
What if you send him a bottle
Of champagne with a note
Telling him to meet you by the pool?
Not bad.
I like it.
Exciting!
exciting!
exciting!
- Front desk. - larry. hi, sugar, it's me again.
Listen, I need you to do me a little unusual favor.
Is there any way you can have something delivered
To one of your employee's homes?
Bloody brilliant.
Mymy dad was sitting in his armchair
Drinking and yelling at the tv.
He loved game shows.
And the guy on the tv gets it wrong
And my dad yells at the screen,
"even a moron would know that!"
And I call out, I said,
"well, then you must be a moron 'cause you didn't know."
So that's when my dad gets up
Out of his chair and grabs me
And he, um, he takes his cigarette
And he... grounds it out right into my arm.
So, when I need
To know what pain feels like,
I got a little reminder.
Annie.
Why don't you come up here.
Tell us a story
From your life.
Something that matters.
Okay.
Um, well, there was this birthday thing that happened.
This really awful girl--naomi, went behind my back, and...
Annie,
Go deeper. something really painful.
Something that might
Be hard to say out loud.
Okay. deeper.
Um, well...
At my old school
There were these girls.
It felt like
Their sole purpose in life was to make me miserable.
Well, one day this guy danny
Who I had a huge crush on,
Asked me to the dance.
So, my mom and I went shopping,
And I bought this. blue dress.
And the way that it flowed down to the floor...
It was like water.
I thought, you know, that it was going
To be the best day of my life.
Only, when I got there,
Danny was standing...
With those girls,
And as soon as they saw me,
They started to laugh.
One of the girls actually
Threw danny a hundred-dollar bill,
Because it was just
A dare.
Oh, god, I don't know
What I was thinking,
Except that
That I wanted to stop thinking.
So...
I took these sleeping pills
From my mom's medicine cabinet,
And I swallowed them-- all.
'cause I just want the pain to end.
Thank you.
I knew you had it in you.
Thank you.
Ethan, ethan, stop.
- Please!
-Rhonda told us that in confidence
- Because she trusted us. - and I didn't say that it was her.
No kidding!
you said it was you!
How could you use something like that as material?
I panicked. okay, I panicked,
Because he said, "go deeper, go deeper,"
And then I thought of her story.
It wasn't a story.
It's her life.
- I know.
- You don't.
Otherwise you never would have done that.
I can't-
- I can't even look at you.
Wow!
Yeah?
I-I mean, what's better than wow?
I don't know, but there needs to be a word.
I was just thinking today
How there should be a word.
Come here.
Told you I'd one-up the high school dance.
Yeah.
This place is pretty awesome.
Oh, just wait till
You see the food.
Apparently, they have
The best chef in the whole city.
Oh, and I ordered a special dessert.
You're gonna die.
What?
Just... wow.
Can I get you anything, Miss Clark?
Oh, no, I'm all right.
Thank you.
I'm actually meeting someone.
Well, just let me know if I can.
Thank you.
I'm just saying, I've never seen my parents
Gush over anyone like that.
Well, it helps that
They go to the same synagogue as my parents.
Trust me, it was all you.
It was all me-- yeah, right.
Come on, let's dance.
Mmm. man, it's going to be hard
To stuff down mom's casseroles
After a meal like that.
Well, as long as you saved room for dessert
- And here is your menu.
- Oh. thanks.
I actually
Preordered that molten chocolate cake.
Oh. okay.
Naomi said it is the best thing
- She's ever tried. - um, miss,
Are-are you sure you ordered it?
What?
yeah.
I told the concierge.
I'm so sorry.
I don't have you down for one,
And unfortunately,
We're all out of them now.
Okay, but I ordered it.
- I told him specifically that...
- Baby, baby,
It's cool-- we'll just get something else.
No!
I don't want something else.
I want the chocolate cake.
I'm terribly sorry.
No, you don't have to be sorry,
Just go get us the cake, please.
Go get us the cake.
Um, can you just give us a sec?
Honey, uh,
Why are you getting so upset?
Because I wanted this to be perfect,
And now it's not gonna be perfect!
Silver... silver,
Relax.
Listen, us...
Being here together, me and you,
That's what makes this perfect.
All right the cake, it's just cake.
All right?
And besides, I didn't even give you your gift yet.
Go ahead, open it.
You like it?
Love it.
I really love it.
Let's get a room.
What?
I love you, and...
I want to be with you.
So let's get a room.
Here.
Tonight.
Can we?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, Where's Annie?
Don't know, don't care.
I thought you weren't coming.
Oh, ye..
But after what happened today,
After telling you guys,
I just felt better.
I don't know
Like maybe I could handle it.
Well, I'm glad you're here.
And you look beautiful.
Thanks.
Uh, you want to dance?
Definitely.
Hey, this is Ethan.
Leave a message after the tone.
Ethan, please call me back.
I know what I did was wrong,
And I'm ashamed of myself.
So please, just forgive me.
Um... are you sure you're ready for this?
I've never been more ready
For anything in my life.
When you said you are bad at dancing,
I totally thought
You were just kidding.
Aw, come on, you were just so jealous
Of my sweet, sweet dance move
Oh, so very jealous!
Your chariot, Madam.
Thanks.
I...
I had a really good time.
Yeah. yeah, me, too.
It was just what I needed.
So...
Good night?
Yeah. yeah.
What?
Uh...
We-we're friends.
- Yeah, but I...
- You know,
I-I have a girlfriend.
Who you broke up with.
What?
I never said that.
You didn't need to.
You danced with me the whole night,
You said I looked beautiful
And now you're standing here with me
At the end of the dance.
I-I was walking you to your car.
But you looked at me like that.
Rhonda, however you think I was looking at you...
You were.
You told me to be honest with you.
Then be honest with yourself.
You were looking at me like that.
If I was...
I'm sorry.
Whatever.
Rhonda, wait.
I'm fine.
I just got to go home.
Come in.
What are you doing here?
Um, y-your mom let me in.
You are such a mess, Ade
Okay, thanks for that.
You're a recovering addict,
You're pregnant,
And you have what I hope
Is chocolates all over your face.
And you are a total mess.
And I couldn't care less.
Want to know why?
'Cause I was at the dance tonight...
And everything was supposed to be perfect.
But it wasn't anywhere near perfect.
Why?
Because I wasn't with you.
So I wanted
To ask you something.
Will you be my valentine?
Yeah.
I will.
Hold-hold on, I got to..
Look, wait, uh, class starts...
You-you know what?
yo-you know what?
Uh, let's.
Let's just
Get detention for being late
- So we can keep doing this after school.
- Okay.
Come here.
You... you okay?
Yeah.
No.
Um...
I'm a little sour.
Well, okay, I was...
I was gonna wait to show it to you,
But... who cares!
Uh, wow.
- That's...
- Your name.
I know.
Don't you go changing it,
- Or I'm gonna be really upset.
- Yeah, okay.
Um, is it... is it real?
Yes.
I got it done
On sunday at this amazing
Tattoo parlor in Venice.
Come here.
I wanted to get something permanent
To symbolize our love
Okay, so, who wants to
Come up here and solve for x?
Sorry to interrupt-
- I wanted to introduce you
To a student that's gonna be joining your class.
Uh, come on in.
All right, everybody, this is Liam Court.
Make him feel at home.
Or at school.
Anyway, carry on.
Please,
Take a seat.
Josie.
Let's have at this equation.
You're in high school?
Thanks to you.
What?
My mom had to sign for that bottle
Of champagne you sent over, with the little note
About how I was your favorite bartender.
Which sort of tipped her off
That I wasn't enrolled here.
Well, how was I supposed to know?
I thought you were older.
Yeah?
well, right back at you.
To ja Ciebie uderzy³em.
To tylko moja wina.

Jaki haczyk?
Jesteœmy przyjació³mi.
Wszystko przez wypadek samochodowy...
Kogo to obchodzi jak siê poznaliœmy?
Sednem jest, ¿e sie poznalismy.
A uczestniczenie w wypadku samochodowym
Mia³o skutek na nas obu, i poznaliœmy siebie.

Dobrze, musisz mi pomóc.

Valentynkowy plan.
Mó-Mówi³am Ci idŸcie po prostu na tañce.
Nie.
Wszyscy id¹ na tañce.

Tak, ale nie w L.A
I-I uwierz mi,
Sceneria tutaj jest zupe³nie ró¿na ni¿ wszystkie-gdzie-mo¿esz-zjeœæ gor¹ce skrzyde³ka miejscówy w Kansas.
- Idê po kolejne picie, chcesz?
- uh-uh.
Przeprasza sie!
Przeprasza siê !
Mam coœ
To pomo¿e poczuæ Ci sie lepiej.
Powiedz mi ¿e to "portobello quiche" [zapiekanka] o której marzy³am ostatniej nocy.
Voil?
Dobrej Zabawy.
To prawie zamaza³o ból Valentynek.
You know, I've eaten the most amazing places in the world,
And nothing comes close to the restaurant at my hotel.
I guess that's why there's, like, a billion cebrbrities
Swarming there all the time.
Oh, my god, you should see
The valentine's day menu they have.
Yeah?
It's beyond.
Lucky you.
Of course, I don't have a date to go with to the restaurant.
And why, almost before we've even begun to live,
Become dull and gray and apathetic
And lazy and useless and unhappy.
Unhappy because I am nothing.
Excellent.
And that's what I'm talking about.
That is it. that's it.
Okay, who's next?
Um, all right, how about you?
Yeah.
Hi. um, I'm annie wilson.
And I will be doing fantine's monologue
From les miserable.
Ah, good monologue. desperate monologue.
A lot of pain and anguish in the class tonight.
Monsieur javert, i-i-i beseech your mercy.
I assure you that I had done nothing wrong.
If you had been there to see it in the beginning,
- Then you would have seen...
- No, no. stop.
Um, annie, this, this woman is desperate.
Honey, you got to delve into your soul.
You gotta, you gotta reach into your own desperation.
Bring that out, okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
And I swear by the good of god that I'm not to blame.
Go deeper.
That, that gentleman,
The bourgeois whom I did not know,
Put snow in my back!
Annie, thas just louder.
Has anyone the right...?
You are about to lose
Ererything.
...to put snow down our backs,
While we are walking along peaceably...
Where's your soul?
To...
Annie,
Annie, come here.
You are about to lose your freedom and your child.
Perhaps you've never experienced something
Of that magnitude in your life,
But surely there is some painful memory
That you can draw on, some...
- You know?
- Yes, yes.
Then go there, please.
Take your time.
I am rather ill, as you see,
And he had said these impertinent things to me...
O-okay.
That's enough. that's enough.
Thank you.
Just, let's get some, somebody else up there.
You're fine.
Thanks.
Why are there sugar hearts in my waffle?
I think, uh, nat got a little carried away
With the valentine's theme.
Is everything okay?
Sure, fine.
Come on. what's wrong?
Um, problems in the middle east.
Significant things like that.
Annie...
Look, it doesn't matter.
I just want to put it out of my head
And enjoy valentine's day with the boy that I love.
And rhonda?
Oh, um, I'm sorry. uh, she, she's early.
Early for what?
Miss, as I told you over the phone,
We're completely booked.
It's valentine's day.
I know that.
Which is why r really need to get in.
I want to take my boyfriend out for a special dinner,
And your restaurant is the best.
Which is why people make reservations months in aanance.
Months a ago, I didn't know about valentine's day!
No, I meant...
Okay, I knew it existed...
Look, I really wish I could help you.
Fine.
I understand.
Thank you for your patience.
Take your ten dollars back, please.
Come on!
Restaura..
Certainly. tonight?
And what time would you like to dine?
Uh, hello?
what's that about?
Excuse me one second.
We keep a small number of tables reserved for hotel guests
Now if you'll excuse me.
So, uh, what are you two crazy kids gonna get up to
While I'm off being tortured by my new acting teacher?
Um, probably just gonna go shopping.
For what?
- Clothes.
- School supplies.
I, uh...
I asked rhonda to, uh, help me find you
A valentine's present.
Trying to brchch out from the stuffed pentapus thing.
I feel very stupid.
I should get going pretty soon, anyway,
But I assume I'll see you you at the dance?
Oh, i-i don't really do dances.
How come
I just had a really bad experience at one.
What happened?
Maybe she doesn't want to talk about it, ethan.
No, I do.
I mean, I don't,
But I should if we're being honest with each other, right?
Okay, so, at my old school
There was a bunch of girls,
I call them mean girls
But they were so much worse than that.
It felt like their sole purpose in life was just to pick on me.
Anyway, so there was this end-of-the-year dance,
And this guy danny asked me out.
And I was shock.
I mean, I had a huge crush on him.
So my mom and I went shopping,
And we found this dress, and it was
Blue and gauzy and it just,
It reminded me of water, of waves.
And I went to the dance
And went looking for danny.
And I fod d him standing with those girls.
And as soon as they saw me, they just...
They all started to laugh.
And one of the girls threw danny a hundred-dollar bill.
Because apparently, the whole thing was just a dare.
I felt so humiliated.
And so I took all my mom's sleeping pills.
Luckily,
My mom found me in time, and, um,and we moved here.
I am so sorry, rhonda.
I've never told anybody that story before.
Well, I'm glad you told us.
Yeah, I am too.
What..
Do you want?
I need reservations downstairs for dinner tonight
And they are completely booked unless you're a guest
At the hotel, which I'm not, you are,
And I wouldn't ask except it's valentine's day.
Valentine's day...
A holiday you once referred to as "the greeting card mafia's
Stranglehold on the brainless and sentimental."
Well, I know, but look..
I've never been in love before.
You... in love?
Yeah. and I want tonight to be perfect.
It has to be perfect.
And I know that here are no reasons for you
To do any favors for me, and we are not exactly friends
Or even frenemies for that matter,
But we were friends at one point, and i...
Look, when we were 12,
I wrote a book report for you on the pearl
And you said that you owed me one, and I never collected,
And I want to collect now. please?
Larry, hi, darling, it's naomi.
Can you do me a favor?
I have a friend
Who needs a reservation for two tonight at 8:00.
Oh, thank you.
Ah!
you're wonderful. bye now.
Just make sure you preorder the molten chocolate cake.
They cook it while you're eating.
That's the best part of the meal.
sounds good.
Can I buy you a drink or something to thank you?
So we should sit by the pool.
There's a really nice view.
Actually, it sometimes gets chilly out there
Do you want to just sit at the bar?
Sure.
I'll be right with you guys.
Thanks.
Well, the view isn't bad here either, huh?
Just don't mention we're in high school.
Oh, okay.
I am on it.
So I said to my supervisor at the airline,
"do not talk to me like that again,
Or I will quit and take my skills elsewhere, I will."
Hey, naomi.
See, that's not fair. you knowy my name,
But I don't know yours.
Leo. so what can I get you two?
I'll have a sparkling water.
Trying to avoid the hard stuff
Till I go back over the pond.
I'll just have a chamomile tea, thanks.
What was that?
English accents always make people sound older.
in what world?
I can't stop now.
Okay, but less is more.
- You got it, mate. - seriously.
- Cheerio. - all right...
One sparkling water,
One chamomile tea.
Thank you. and I do appreciate that, I do.
Sure thing. honey?
Well, you're awfully forward, aren't you?
For your tea.
Honey?
Oh, righ
No thank you.
So you're new here.
yeah, just moved to l.a.
With your... girlfriend?
Well, if I had a girl,
I wouldn't be flirting with your friend here.
Excuse me, sir.
- Can we get another round?
- I got to get back to work.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hi.
What are you, uh...
Wow, what a coincidence.
Yeah.
Wait, uh, adrianna,
Um, I just wanted
To apologize for what happened by the lockers yesterday.
- It's fine. - no, no, no, it's not fine.
I was a jerk and I'm sorry.
It's just, the guys were talking
And nika was there, and...
I didn't want to make her feel bad.
But I ended up making you feel bad, which--
Which is the last thing I wanted to do.
Look, it's a weird situation all around.
Trust me, I get it.
Right.
Well, the next time anybody says
Anything, okay,
I'm gonna...
Shut 'em down. navid-style, okay?
- Yeah, and what exactly does that entail?
- I don't know.
I'll let you know when I have that
- Figured out. - okay.
Hopefully, I'll have it
Worked out by the dance tonight.
Well, no rush-
- I'm not going.
Sorry to bring up the dance.
Now everything's even more awkward.
No, it's, it's not.
I'm really happy you met someone else.
I really am.
You're such a special guy.
You deserve to have fun, and to go to dances
And just...
Just be normal.
And normal is not really where I'm at right now.
Um, ooh, make sure that you get nika the butter crunch truffles, 'cause there's really nothing like them
In the entire world.
- Truffles?
- she'll love them.
All right.
Okay.
Have fun eating your chocolate.
Happy valentine's day.
Yeah, you, too.
you know, right?
that's what I thought.
I mean, this is nice, but it's not "wow,"
And I'm really going for "wow," or anything better than "wow."
Is there even a word that's better than "wow"?
Here, wear these.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, come here!
thank you!
Okay, hugging me over shoes--
Seriously, what has has gotten into you, silver?
You're a completely diffenent person.
It's the love, man.
I'm telling you, it changes things.
It's like I see the world as this whole better place.
And, naomi, I never thought that I could feel like this.
Well, I'm glad you found somnene who makes you this happy.
Plus, it's been kind of cool us hanging out again.
It has, hasn't it?
So, okay, what are you going to do about hotty bartender?
Oh...
Oh, oh, okay, wait.
You've got to ask him for a date tonight for valentine's day.
Well, it's not like I have any other plans, but...
Oh, well, no, his shift just ended.
I think he said he was going home.
What if you send him a bottle
Of champagne with a note
Telling him to meet you by the pool?
Not bad.
I like it.
Exciting!
exciting!
exciting!
- Front desk. - larry. hi, sugar, it's me again.
Listen, I need you to do me a little unusual favor.
Is there any way you can have something delivered
To one of your employee's homes?
Bloody brilliant.
Mymy dad was sitting in his armchair
Drinking and yelling at the tv.
He loved game shows.
And the guy on the tv gets it wrong
And my dad yells at the screen,
"even a moron would know that!"
And I call out, I said,
"well, then you must be a moron 'cause you didn't know."
So that's when my dad gets up
Out of his chair and grabs me
And he, um, he takes his cigarette
And he... grounds it out right into my arm.
So, when I need
To know what pain feels like,
I got a little reminder.
Annie.
Why don't you come up here.
Tell us a story
From your life.
Something that matters.
Okay.
Um, well, there was this birthday thing that happened.
This really awful girl--naomi, went behind my back, and...
Annie,
Go deeper. something really painful.
Something that might
Be hard to say out loud.
Okay. deeper.
Um, well...
At my old school
There were these girls.
It felt like
Their sole purpose in life was to make me miserable.
Well, one day this guy danny
Who I had a huge crush on,
Asked me to the dance.
So, my mom and I went shopping,
And I bought this. blue dress.
And the way that it flowed down to the floor...
It was like water.
I thought, you know, that it was going
To be the best day of my life.
Only, when I got there,
Danny was standing...
With those girls,
And as soon as they saw me,
They started to laugh.
One of the girls actually
Threw danny a hundred-dollar bill,
Because it was just
A dare.
Oh, god, I don't know
What I was thinking,
Except that
That I wanted to stop thinking.
So...
I took these sleeping pills
From my mom's medicine cabinet,
And I swallowed them-- all.
'cause I just want the pain to end.
Thank you.
I knew you had it in you.
Thank you.
Ethan, ethan, stop.
- Please!
-Rhonda told us that in confidence
- Because she trusted us. - and I didn't say that it was her.
No kidding!
you said it was you!
How could you use something like that as material?
I panicked. okay, I panicked,
Because he said, "go deeper, go deeper,"
And then I thought of her story.
It wasn't a story.
It's her life.
- I know.
- You don't.
Otherwise you never would have done that.
I can't-
- I can't even look at you.
Wow!
Yeah?
I-I mean, what's better than wow?
I don't know, but there needs to be a word.
I was just thinking today
How there should be a word.
Come here.
Told you I'd one-up the high school dance.
Yeah.
This place is pretty awesome.
Oh, just wait till
You see the food.
Apparently, they have
The best chef in the whole city.
Oh, and I ordered a special dessert.
You're gonna die.
What?
Just... wow.
Can I get you anything, Miss Clark?
Oh, no, I'm all right.
Thank you.
I'm actually meeting someone.
Well, just let me know if I can.
Thank you.
I'm just saying, I've never seen my parents
Gush over anyone like that.
Well, it helps that
They go to the same synagogue as my parents.
Trust me, it was all you.
It was all me-- yeah, right.
Come on, let's dance.
Mmm. man, it's going to be hard
To stuff down mom's casseroles
After a meal like that.
Well, as long as you saved room for dessert
- And here is your menu.
- Oh. thanks.
I actually
Preordered that molten chocolate cake.
Oh. okay.
Naomi said it is the best thing
- She's ever tried. - um, miss,
Are-are you sure you ordered it?
What?
yeah.
I told the concierge.
I'm so sorry.
I don't have you down for one,
And unfortunately,
We're all out of them now.
Okay, but I ordered it.
- I told him specifically that...
- Baby, baby,
It's cool-- we'll just get something else.
No!
I don't want something else.
I want the chocolate cake.
I'm terribly sorry.
No, you don't have to be sorry,
Just go get us the cake, please.
Go get us the cake.
Um, can you just give us a sec?
Honey, uh,
Why are you getting so upset?
Because I wanted this to be perfect,
And now it's not gonna be perfect!
Silver... silver,
Relax.
Listen, us...
Being here together, me and you,
That's what makes this perfect.
All right the cake, it's just cake.
All right?
And besides, I didn't even give you your gift yet.
Go ahead, open it.
You like it?
Love it.
I really love it.
Let's get a room.
What?
I love you, and...
I want to be with you.
So let's get a room.
Here.
Tonight.
Can we?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, Where's Annie?
Don't know, don't care.
I thought you weren't coming.
Oh, ye..
But after what happened today,
After telling you guys,
I just felt better.
I don't know
Like maybe I could handle it.
Well, I'm glad you're here.
And you look beautiful.
Thanks.
Uh, you want to dance?
Definitely.
Hey, this is Ethan.
Leave a message after the tone.
Ethan, please call me back.
I know what I did was wrong,
And I'm ashamed of myself.
So please, just forgive me.
Um... are you sure you're ready for this?
I've never been more ready
For anything in my life.
When you said you are bad at dancing,
I totally thought
You were just kidding.
Aw, come on, you were just so jealous
Of my sweet, sweet dance move
Oh, so very jealous!
Your chariot, Madam.
Thanks.
I...
I had a really good time.
Yeah. yeah, me, too.
It was just what I needed.
So...
Good night?
Yeah. yeah.
What?
Uh...
We-we're friends.
- Yeah, but I...
- You know,
I-I have a girlfriend.
Who you broke up with.
What?
I never said that.
You didn't need to.
You danced with me the whole night,
You said I looked beautiful
And now you're standing here with me
At the end of the dance.
I-I was walking you to your car.
But you looked at me like that.
Rhonda, however you think I was looking at you...
You were.
You told me to be honest with you.
Then be honest with yourself.
You were looking at me like that.
If I was...
I'm sorry.
Whatever.
Rhonda, wait.
I'm fine.
I just got to go home.
Come in.
What are you doing here?
Um, y-your mom let me in.
You are such a mess, Ade
Okay, thanks for that.
You're a recovering addict,
You're pregnant,
And you have what I hope
Is chocolates all over your face.
And you are a total mess.
And I couldn't care less.
Want to know why?
'Cause I was at the dance tonight...
And everything was supposed to be perfect.
But it wasn't anywhere near perfect.
Why?
Because I wasn't with you.
So I wanted
To ask you something.
Will you be my valentine?
Yeah.
I will.
Hold-hold on, I got to..
Look, wait, uh, class starts...
You-you know what?
yo-you know what?
Uh, let's.
Let's just
Get detention for being late
- So we can keep doing this after school.
- Okay.
Come here.
You... you okay?
Yeah.
No.
Um...
I'm a little sour.
Well, okay, I was...
I was gonna wait to show it to you,
But... who cares!
Uh, wow.
- That's...
- Your name.
I know.
Don't you go changing it,
- Or I'm gonna be really upset.
- Yeah, okay.
Um, is it... is it real?
Yes.
I got it done
On sunday at this amazing
Tattoo parlor in Venice.
Come here.
I wanted to get something permanent
To symbolize our love
Okay, so, who wants to
Come up here and solve for x?
Sorry to interrupt-
- I wanted to introduce you
To a student that's gonna be joining your class.
Uh, come on in.
All right, everybody, this is Liam Court.
Make him feel at home.
Or at school.
Anyway, carry on.
Please,
Take a seat.
Josie.
Let's have at this equation.
You're in high school?
Thanks to you.
What?
My mom had to sign for that bottle
Of champagne you sent over, with the little note
About how I was your favorite bartender.
Which sort of tipped her off
That I wasn't enrolled here.
Well, how was I supposed to know?
I thought you were older.
Yeah?
well, right back at you.
Previously on 90210
I'm the guy that hit you.
It was totally my fault.
You know, the important thing is that we're both all right.
Navid, I'm not really asking you for anything.
Good, 'cause I...
I don't know if I can do anything, or be anything to you.
I reserved a hotel suite, I'll be staying there until mom comes home.
Hey, everyone.
I have something to announced I'm pregnant.
Christine, hey.
Nika.
I'd like you to meet Navid.
Hi.
What's up?
This being in love stuff is making me crazy.
You love me?
I do.
What is this about?
I'm just trying to get to know you.
The accident, it changed things.
I mean, I feel like it woke me up or something, like it jolted me out of my bubble.
The bubble that I'm still in.
Coming.
Morning, Aaron.
Good morning, Ms. Clark.
Have a nice day.
Fashion section?
Always.
Your car is waiting, Ms. Clark
Thank you.
Morning, Troy.
You're not Robert.
Picked up his morning shift.
Hope you're not disappointed, Naomi.
How do you know my name?
Oh, Robert told me to expect you.
Although...
I wasn't expecting you.
Vanilla skim latte.
Extra foam.
Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you!
Hey!
I am talking to you.
I said I want a bloody scotch.
I'm sorry, sir.
The bar doesn't open until 10:00.
Do you know who I am?
!
Let me tell you this slow, right,
So you can understand my english
Get me a scotch!
Or I'll call ins and get you shipped back to Mexico faster than you sayy "burrito." How's that?
Excuse me.
Small problem.
What?
Well, just that it'd be odd if you tried to send Miguel here back to Mexico since he's from Guatemala.
Unless you meant send him on vavacation, which would actually be a nice thing to do, considering he works hard and has to do with drunks like you all day.
You looking for an ass kicking, sunshine?
No, not particularly.
What the hell are you doing?
What...
Get off!
Do you know who I am?
!
Hey!
What... what are you...
Get off me!
Hey, babe.
You weren't supposed to see that.
Oh, all right, I...
I didn't see it.
But good choice on the red rose.
It definitely brings out my eyes.
And I love your eyes.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I love hearing that.
I love saying it.
I love being in it.
I mean, it's like everything is different now.
I feel different now.
Oh, this morning on the radio, they played Whitney Houston.
First time I ever heard her and she didn't sound I like some big sappy goober I...
I wanted to strangle.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Because...
I will always love you.
Always.
Always love you.
Well, you know, you're being a big cheesy goober right now too.
Yeah, well, I'm your big cheesy goober, okay?
All right, so...
What?
So you're still not gonna tell me anything about our mysterious valentine's plans, huh?
If I tell you it won't be mysterious.
Oh, all right, whitney, do your thing.
Do your thing.
Uh-huh.
So huh, I could pick you up around 8:00 if you want to just grab dinner before the dance.
I can't.
I actually, uh, got to the acting intensive that I signed up for.
So I'll be there until 9:00, if you want to pick me up then.
Sure.
Uh, you didn't tell myoyou got in.
Why not?
Yeah, um, well, it's just, it's kind of hard to talk to you about acting without you thinking that acting's all I talk about.
Um, I said that I'm sorry about that.
Yeah, I know.
But you think it's trite, and so it's kind f difficult for me to...
Hey, hang on one minute, okay?
Yeah.
Sure.
What's their deal anyway?
You know, they... they talk about deep things.
But I swear, if I had to hear about how the accident changed everything one more time,
I may actually drive into a tree myself.
Okay.
Well, you just let me know before you do that, so I'm not in the car.
I just want her to get better already.
Maybe then, he won't have to hang out with her so much.
Hey, Rhonda.
Morning.
How are you feeling?
A little achy, but okay.
Sorry you couldn't come to the documentary with us last night.
Oh, yeah, I had play practice.
But, uh, was it any good?
Amazing.
It was all just about how one moment can change things forever.
Which is so true
I mean, the accident profoundly changed me.
Ethan, too.
I mean, he used to like action movies, but now he likes documentaries.
Yeah, I...
I think she means changes on the inside.
Yeah, I know.
I...
I was just kidding.
All right, well, we should go to class.
Yeah.
I'll see you guys later.
See ya.
Okay, maybe you should drive into a tree.
Bet Navid knows.
Hi ?
What's up?
Oh, yeah, Navid knows everything.
What's up?
So who's Adrianna's baby daddy?
Oh, yeah, I don't even know that.
Could be anyone.
I have no idea.
Man, you dodged a bullet, huh?
Oh, ah ah, totally, man.
I mean, Adrianna's a mess.
I don't even know what I was thinking, seriously.
I mean, she has her own thing going on.
I'm not even gonna worry about.
Yeah, me neither.
No "b".
Time for rososes.
Okay, so.
Megan, and here's one for you, Michael.
Nika, here you go.
Another one for Megan.
Joanna.
One for Maya.
And Adrianna.
Oh, honey.
I'm getting pity flowers from the faculty.
I mean, I thought they only did that with the 12th grader in the full body cast.
Scoliosis girl?
I think she has a boyfriend now.
Of course she does.
Hey, are you okay?
I guess for a second I thought it might be something romantic.
I don't know why.
I mean, obviously, I'm not anybody's idea of a great valentine's date.
I mean, look at me.
For the record, you look great.
You have super boobage going on, crazy thick hair, the dewy, glowlolook that's all the rage on the runway, you've got it.
If I were going to the island of lesbos, you'd be my pick.
Thank you.
Ethan.
Oh, my gosh.
You waited?
I was going over my essay with Mr. Matthews for at least a half an hour.
It's lunch, aren't you starving?
Yeah, but, I mean, what are a few hunger pains compared to what you're going through?
Which is all because of me.
So let's face it, I owe you.
Right?
but let's go before they run out of pizza and we get stuck with that brown stuff they pass off as meat loaf.
Ethan, wait.
There's something I have to tell you.
I...
I just don't know how to tell you without coming off like some kind of crazy woman.
Which... which I'm not.
I...
I swear.
What is it?
Um...
I'm... feeling better than I've been letting on.
A lot better.
I've been exaggerating my injuries.
I can carry my own bag.
What?
I really liked spending time with you, and I just thought that if I was better, that you wouldn't want to hang out anymore.
It... it doesn't matter.
I'm sorry I took advantage of you.
You're officially off the hook.
What hook?
We're friends.
Just because of some car accident...
Who cares how we met?
The point is, we did.
And being in an accident affected us both, and we get each other.
More than that, we like each other.
At least, that's what I thought.
I don't know, maybe-maybe you're getting sick of me or something.
No.
I...
I'm not.
Okay.
Good.
But we have to be honest with each other from now on.
'Cause life's too short for dishonesty.
I completely agree.
I wonder where Ethan is.
Probably off discovering the meaning of life.
All righ you got to help me.
I have to plan this unique valentine's plan.
I...
I told you, just go to the dance.
No. everybody's gonna go to the dance.
Take Dixon on meme romantic valentine's dinner.
The boy loves food.
Yeah, but hasn't he been on a romantic valentine's dinner before?
Yeah, but not in L.A.
And-and trust me, the scene here is way different than the all-you-can-eat hot wings place in Kansas.
I'm gonna get another drink.
You want one?
Uh-uh.
Excuse you!
Excuse you!
I have something it's gonna help you feel better.
Tell me it's the portobello quiche I dreamt about last night.
Voila.
Enjoy.
This almost have stalled the valentine pain.
You know, I've eaten the most amazing places in the world, and nothing comes close to the restaurant at my hotel.
I guess that's why there's, like, a billion cebrbrities swarming there all the time.
Oh, my God, you should see the valentine's day menu they have.
Yeah?
It's beyond.
Lucky you.
Of course, I don't have a date to go with to the restaurant.
And why, almost before we've even begun to live, become dull and gray and apathetic and lazy and useless and unhappy.
Unhappy because I am nothing.
Excellent.
And that's what I'm talking about.
That is it.
That's it.
Okay, who's next?
Um, all right, how about you?
Yeah.
Hi. um, I'm Annie Wilson.
And I will be doing fantine's monologue from les miserable.
Ah, good monologue.
Desperate monologue.
A lot of pain and anguish in the class tonight.
Monsieur Javert, I...
I...
I beseech your mercy.
I assure you that I had done nothing wrong.
If you had been there to see it in the beginning, then you would have seen...
No, no.
Stop.
Um, Annie, this, this woman is desperate.
Honey, you got to delve into your soul.
You gotta, you gotta reach into your own desperation.
Bring that out, okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
And I swear by the good of god that I'm not to blame.
Go deeper.
That, that gentleman, the bourgeois whom I did not know, put snow in my back!
Annie, thas just louder.
Has anyone the right...?
You are about to lose everything.
To put snow down our backs, while we are walking along peaceably...
Where's your soul?
To...
Annie,
Annie, come here.
You are about to lose your freedom and your child.
Perhaps you've never experienced something of that magnitude in your life, but surely there is some painful memory that you can draw on, some... you know?
Yes, yes.
Then go there, please.
Take your time.
I am rather ill, as you see, and he had said these impertinent things to me...
O... okay.
That's enough.
That's enough.
Thank you.
Just, let's get some, somebody else up there.
You're fine.
Thanks.
Why are there sugar hearts in my waffle?
I think, uh, Nat got a little carried away with the valentine's theme.
Is everything okay?
Sure, fine.
Come on.
What's wrong?
Um, problems in the middle east.
Significant things like that.
Annie...
Look, it doesn't matter.
I just want to put it out of my head and enjoy valentine's day with the boy that I love.
And Rhonda?
Oh, um, I'm sorry. uh, she, she's early.
Early for what?
Miss, as I told you over the phone, we're completely booked.
It's valentine's day.
I know that.
Which is why I really need to get in.
I want to take my boyfriend out for a special dinner, and your restaurant is the best.
Which is why people make reservations months in advance.
Months a ago, I didn't know about valentine's day!
No, I meant... okay, I knew it existed...
Look, I really wish I could help you.
Fine.
I understand.
Thank you for your patience.
Take your ten dollars back, please.
Come on!
Restaurant
Certainly.
Tonight?
And what time would you like to dine?
Uh, hello?
what's that about?
Excuse me one second.
We keep a small number of tables reserved for hotel guests, now if you'll excuse me.
So, uh, what are you two crazy kids gonna get up to while I'm off being tortured by my new acting teacher?
Um, probably just gonna go shopping.
For what?
Clothes.
School supplies.
I, uh...
I asked Rhonda to, uh, help me find you a valentine's present.
Trying to brunch out from the stuffed pentapus thing.
I feel very stupid.
I should get going pretty soon, anyway, but I assume I'll see you you at the dance?
Oh, I...
I don't really do dances.
How come?
I just had a really bad experience at one.
What happened?
Maybe she doesn't want to talk about it, Ethan.
No, I do.
I mean, I don't, but I should if we're being honest with each other, right?
Okay, so, at my old school there was a bunch of girls,
I call them mean girls but they were so much worse than that.
It felt like their sole purpose in life was just to pick on me.
Anyway, so there was this end-of-the-year dance, and this guy Danny asked me out.
And I was shock.
I mean, I had a huge crush on him.
So my mom and I went shopping, and we found this dress, and it was blue and gauzy and it just, it reminded me of water, of waves.
And I went to the dance and went looking for Danny.
And I found him standing with those girls.
And as soon as they saw me, they just... they all started to laugh.
And one of the girls threw Danny a hundred-dollar bill.
Because apparently, the whole thing was just a dare.
I felt so humiliated.
And so I took all my mom's sleeping pills.
Luckily, my mom found me in time, and, um,and we moved here.
I am so sorry, Rhonda.
I've never told anybody that story before.
Well, I'm glad you told us.
Yeah, I am too.
What..
do you want?
I need reservations downstairs for dinner tonight and they are completely booked unless you're a guest at the hotel, which I'm not, you are, and I wouldn't ask except it's valentine's day.
Valentine's day... a holiday you once referred to as "the greeting card mafia's stranglehold on the brainless and sentimental."
Well, I know, but look..
I've never been in love before.
You... in love?
Yeah.
And I want tonight to be perfect.
It has to be perfect.
And I know that here are no reasons for you to do any favors for me, and we are not exactly friends or even frenemies for that matter, but we were friends at one point, and I...
Look, when we were 12,
I wrote a book report for you on the pearl and you said that you owed me one, and I never collected, and I want to collect now.
Please?
Larry, hi, darling, it's Naomi.
Can you do me a favor?
I have a friend who needs a reservation for two tonight at 8:00.
Oh, thank you.
Ah!
You're wonderful.
Bye now.
Just make sure you preorder the molten chocolate cake.
They cook it while you're eating.
That's the best part of the meal.
Sounds good.
Can I buy you a drink or something to thank you?
So we should sit by the pool.
There's a really nice view.
Actually, it sometimes gets chilly out there.
Do you want to just sit at the bar?
Sure.
I'll be right with you guys.
Thanks.
Well, the view isn't bad here either, huh?
Just don't mention we're in high school.
Oh, okay.
I am on it.
So I said to my supervisor at the airline,
"do not talk to me like that again, or I will quit and take my skills elsewhere, I will."
Hey, Naomi.
See, that's not fair. you knowy my name, but I don't know yours.
Leo.
So what can I get you two?
I'll have a sparkling water.
Trying to avoid the hard stuff till I go back over the pond.
I'll just have a chamomile tea, thanks.
What was that?
English accents always make people sound older.
In what world?
I can't stop now.
Okay, but less is more.
You got it, mate.
Seriously.
Cheerio.
All right... one sparkling water, one chamomile tea.
Thank you.
And I do appreciate that, I do.
Sure thing.
Honey?
Well, you're awfully forward, aren't you?
For your tea.
Honey?
Oh, right.
No thank you.
So you're new here.
Yeah, just moved to L.A.
With your... girlfriend?
Well, if I had a girl,
I wouldn't be flirting with your friend here.
Excuse me, sir.
Can we get another round?
I got to get back to work.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hi.
What are you, uh...
Wow, what a coincidence.
Yeah.
Wait, uh, Adrianna, um, I just wanted to apologize for what happened by the lockers yesterday.
It's fine.
No, no, no, it's not fine.
I was a jerk and I'm sorry.
It's just, the guys were talking and Nika was there, and...
I didn't want to make her feel bad.
But I ended up making you feel bad, which... which is the last thing I wanted to do.
Look, it's a weird situation all around.
Trust me, I get it.
Right.
Well, the next time anybody says
Anything, okay,
I'm gonna...
Shut 'em down.
Navid-style, okay?
Yeah, and what exactly does that entail?
I don't know.
I'll let you know when I have that figured out.
Okay.
Hopefully, I'll have it
Worked out by the dance tonight.
Well, no rush...
I'm not going.
Sorry to bring up the dance.
Now everything's even more awkward.
No, it's, it's not.
I'm really happy you met someone else.
I really am.
You're such a special guy.
You deserve to have fun, and to go to dances and just... just be normal.
And normal is not really where I'm at right now.
Um, ooh, make sure that you get Nika the butter crunch truffles, 'cause there's really nothing like them in the entire world.
Truffles?
She'll love them.
All right.
Okay.
Have fun eating your chocolate.
Happy valentine's day.
Yeah, you, too.
You know, right?
That's what I thought.
I mean, this is nice, but it's not "wow,"
and I'm really going for "wow," or anything better than "wow."
Is there even a word that's better than "wow"?
Here, wear these.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, come here!
thank you!
Okay, hugging me over shoes...
Seriously, what has has gotten into you, Silver?
You're a completely different person.
It's the love, man.
I'm telling you, it changes things.
It's like I see the world as this whole better place.
And, Naomi, I never thought that I could feel like this.
Well, I'm glad you found someone who makes you this happy.
Plus, it's been kind of cool us hanging out again.
It has, hasn't it?
So, okay, what are you going to do about hotty bartender?
Oh... oh, oh, okay, wait.
You've got to ask him for a date tonight for valentine's day.
Well, it's not like I have any other plans, but...
Oh, well, no, his shift just ended.
I think he said he was going home.
What if you send him a bottle
Of champagne with a note telling him to meet you by the pool?
Not bad.
I like it.
Exciting!
exciting!
exciting!
Front desk.
Larry.
Hi, sugar, it's me again.
Listen, I need you to do me a little unusual favor.
Is there any way you can have something delivered to one of your employee's homes?
Bloody brilliant.
Mymy dad was sitting in his armchair drinking and yelling at the tv.
He loved game shows.
And the guy on the tv gets it wrong and my dad yells at the screen,
"even a moron would know that!"
And I call out, I said,
"well, then you must be a moron 'cause you didn't know."
So that's when my dad gets up out of his chair and grabs me and he, um, he takes his cigarette and he... grounds it out right into my arm.
So, when I need to know what pain feels like,
I got a little reminder.
Annie.
Why don't you come up here.
Tell us a story from your life.
Something that matters.
Okay.
Um, well, there was this birthday thing that happened.
This really awful girl...
Naomi, went behind my back, and...
Annie, go deeper.
Something really painful.
Something that might be hard to say out loud.
Okay.
Deeper.
Um, well... at my old school there were these girls.
It felt like their sole purpose in life was to make me miserable.
Well, one day this guy Danny who I had a huge crush on, asked me to the dance.
So, my mom and I went shopping, and I bought this blue dress.
And the way that it flowed down to the floor... it was like water.
I thought, you know, that it was going to be the best day of my life.
Only, when I got there,
Danny was standing... with those girls, and as soon as they saw me, they started to laugh.
One of the girls actually threw Danny a hundred-dollar bill, because it was just a dare.
Oh, God, I don't know what I was thinking, except that, that I wanted to stop thinking.
So...
I took these sleeping pills from my mom's medicine cabinet, and I swallowed them... all.
'Cause I just want the pain to end.
Thank you.
I knew you had it in you.
Thank you.
Ethan, Ethan, stop.
Please!
Rhonda told us that in confidence because she trusted us.
And I didn't say that it was her.
No kidding!
You said it was you!
How could you use something like that as material?
I panicked.
Okay, I panicked, because he said, "go deeper, go deeper,"
and then I thought of her story.
It wasn't a story.
It's her life.
I know.
You don't.
Otherwise you never would have done that.
I can't...
I can't even look at you.
Wow!
Yeah?
I-I mean, what's better than wow?
I don't know, but there needs to be a word.
I was just thinking today how there should be a word.
Come here.
Told you I'd one-up the high school dance.
Yeah.
This place is pretty awesome.
Oh, just wait till you see the food.
Apparently, they have the best chef in the whole city.
Oh, and I ordered a special dessert.
You're gonna die.
What?
Just... wow.
Can I get you anything, Miss Clark?
Oh, no, I'm all right.
Thank you.
I'm actually meeting someone.
Well, just let me know if I can.
Thank you.
I'm just saying, I've never seen my parents gush over anyone like that.
Well, it helps that they go to the same synagogue as my parents.
Trust me, it was all you.
It was all me... yeah, right.
Come on, let's dance.
Mmm.
Man, it's going to be hard to stuff down mom's casseroles after a meal like that.
Well, as long as you saved room for dessert and here is your menu.
Oh.
Thanks.
I actually preordered that molten chocolate cake.
Oh.
Okay.
Naomi said it is the best thing she's ever tried.
Um, Miss,
Are... are you sure you ordered it?
What?
Yeah.
I told the concierge.
I'm so sorry.
I don't have you down for one, and unfortunately, we're all out of them now.
Okay, but I ordered it.
I told him specifically that...
Baby, baby, it's cool... we'll just get something else.
No!
I don't want something else.
I want the chocolate cake.
I'm terribly sorry.
No, you don't have to be sorry, just go get us the cake, please.
Go get us the cake.
Um, can you just give us a sec?
Honey, uh, why are you getting so upset?
Because I wanted this to be perfect, and now it's not gonna be perfect!
Silver...
Silver, relax.
Listen, us... being here together, me and you, that's what makes this perfect.
All right the cake, it's just cake.
All right?
And besides, I didn't even give you your gift yet.
Go ahead, open it.
You like it?
Love it.
I really love it.
Let's get a room.
What?
I love you, and...
I want to be with you.
So let's get a room.
Here.
Tonight.
Can we?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, Where's Annie?
Don't know, don't care.
I thought you weren't coming.
Oh, ye..
but after what happened today, after telling you guys,
I just felt better.
I don't know, like maybe I could handle it.
Well, I'm glad you're here.
And you look beautiful.
Thanks.
Uh, you want to dance?
Definitely.
Hey, this is Ethan.
Leave a message after the tone.
Ethan, please call me back.
I know what I did was wrong, and I'm ashamed of myself.
So please, just forgive me.
Um... are you sure you're ready for this?
I've never been more ready for anything in my life.
I totally thought you were just kidding.
Aw, come on, you were just so jealous of my sweet, sweet dance move.
Oh, so very jealous!
Your chariot, Madam.
Thanks.
I...
I had a really good time.
Yeah.
Yeah, me, too.
It was just what I needed.
So... good night?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
Uh... we... we're friends.
Yeah, but I..
You know,
I...
I have a girlfriend.
Who you broke up with.
What?
I never said that.
You didn't need to.
You danced with me the whole night, you said I looked beautiful and now you're standing here with me
At the end of the dance.
I...
I was walking you to your car.
But you looked at me like that.
Rhonda, however you think I was looking at you... you were.
You told me to be honest with you.
Then be honest with yourself.
You were looking at me like that.
If I was...
I'm sorry.
Whatever.
Rhonda, wait.
I'm fine.
I just got to go home.
Come in.
What are you doing here?
Um, y... your mom let me in.
You are such a mess, Ade.
Okay, thanks for that.
You're a recovering addict, you're pregnant, and you have what I hope is chocolates all over your face.
And you are a total mess.
And I couldn't care less.
Want to know why?
'Cause I was at the dance tonight... and everything was supposed to be perfect.
But it wasn't anywhere near perfect.
Why?
Because I wasn't with you.
So I wanted to ask you something.
Will you be my valentine?
Yeah.
I will.
Hold... hold on, I got to..
You... you know what?
Yo... you know what?
Uh, let's.
Let's just get detention for being late so we can keep doing this after school.
Okay.
Come here.
You... you okay?
Yeah.
No.
Um...
I'm a little sour.
Well, okay, I was...
I was gonna wait to show it to you, but... who cares!
Uh, wow.
That's...
Your name.
I know.
Don't you go changing it, or I'm gonna be really upset.
Yeah, okay.
Um, is it... is it real?
Yes.
I got it done on Sunday at this amazing tattoo parlor in Venice.
Come here.
I wanted to get something permanent to symbolize our love.
Okay, so, who wants to come up here and solve for x?
Sorry to interrupt...
I wanted to introduce you to a student that's gonna be joining your class.
Uh, come on in.
All right, everybody, this is Liam Court.
Make him feel at home.
Or at school.
Anyway, carry on.
Please, take a seat.
Josie.
Let's have at this equation.
You're in high school?
Thanks to you.
What?
My mom had to sign for that bottle of champagne you sent over, with the little note about how I was your favorite bartender.
Which sort of tipped her off
Tat I wasn't enrolled here.
Well, how was I supposed to know?
I thought you were older.
Yeah?
Well, right back at you.
"Previously on" 90210:
I'm the guy that hit you.
It was totally my fault.
The important thing is that we're both all right.
Navid, I'm not really asking you for anything.
Good.
Because I don't know if I can do anything or be anything to you.
I reserved a hotel suite.
I'll be there until mom comes home.
Hey, everyone, I have something to announce.
I'm pregnant.
- Hey, Nika.
I'd like you to meet Navid.
- Hi, what's up?
This being in love stuff is making me crazy.
- Do you love me?
- I do.
- What is this about?
- I'm just trying to get to know you.
The accident, it changed things.
I feel like it woke me up or something, like it jolted me out of my bubble.
A bubble that I'm still in.
Coming.
- Morning, Aaron.
- Good morning, Miss Clark.
Have a nice day.
- Fashion section?
- Always.
- Your car is waiting, Ms. Clark.
- Thank you.
- Good morning, Troy.
- Good morning, Ms. Clark.
You're not Robert.
I picked up his morning shift.
Hope you're not disappointed, Naomi.
- How do you know my name?
- Well, Robert told me to expect you.
Although, I wasn't expecting you.
Vanilla skim latte, extra foam.
Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you.
Boy, I am talking to you.
I said I want a bloody Scotch.
I'm sorry, sir.
The bar doesn't open until 10.
Do you know who I am?
Let me take this slow, right?
So you can understand my English.
Get me a Scotch or I'll call INS and get you shipped back to Mexico faster than you can say "burrito. " How's that?
Excuse me.
Small problem.
- What?
- Well, just that it'd be odd if you try to send Miguel here back to Mexico since he's from Guatemala.
Unless you meant to send him on a vacation, which would actually be a nice thing to do considering he works hard and has to deal with drunks like you all day.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey.
Get off...
Do you know who I am?
- Come on, let's go.
- Why?
What are you...?
Get off me.
All right.
Hey, babe.
Hey.
You weren't supposed to see that.
Oh, all right, all right, I didn't see it.
But good choice on the red rose.
It definitely brings out my eyes.
And I love your eyes.
- And I love you.
- And I love you too.
- I love hearing that.
- I love saying it.
I love being in it.
I mean, everything is different now.
I feel different now.
Oh, this morning on the radio they played Whitney Houston.
First time I heard her and she didn't sound like some big, sappy goober
I wanted to strangle.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Because I will always love you.
Always.
Always love you.
Well, you know you're being a big, cheesy goober right now too, huh?
Well, I'm your big cheesy goober, okay?
- Right.
So...
- What?
So you're still not gonna tell me anything about our mysterious Valentine's plans, huh?
If I tell you, it wouldn't be mysterious.
Oh, all right.
Whitney, do your thing.
So I can pick you up around 8 if you wanna just grab dinner before the dance?
I can't.
I actually got into that acting intensive that I signed up for, so I'll be there until 9.
- If you wanna pick me up then?
- Sure.
You didn't tell me you got in.
Why not?
Yeah, well, it's just...
It's kind of hard to talk to you about acting without you thinking that acting is all I talk about.
I'm...
I said that I'm sorry about that.
Yeah, I know, but you think it's trite and so it's kind of difficult for me to...
Hey, hang on one minute, okay?
Yeah.
Sure.
Hey.
What's their deal, anyway?
You know, they talk about deep things.
But I swear, if I have to hear about how the accident changed everything one more time, I may actually drive into a tree myself.
Okay.
Well, you just let me know before you do that so I'm not in the car.
I just want her to get better already, maybe then he won't hang out with her so much.
- Hey, Rhonda.
- Morning.
Hey.
- How are you feeling?
- A little achy but okay.
Sorry you couldn't come to the documentary.
Oh, yeah.
I had play practice.
- But was it any good?
- Amazing.
It was all just about how one moment can change things forever.
Which is so true.
I mean, the accident profoundly changed me.
Ethan too.
I mean, he used to like action movies but now he likes documentaries.
Yeah.
I think she means changes on the inside.
Yeah, I know.
I was just kidding, jeez.
All right.
Well, we should go to class.
Yeah.
I'll see you guys later.
See you.
Hey, maybe you should drive into a tree.
- It's probably some dude in rehab.
- I bet Navid knows.
What's up?
Oh, yeah, Navid knows everything.
What's up?
So who's Adrianna's baby dad?
Oh, yeah.
I don't even know that.
Could be anyone.
I have no idea.
Man, you dodged a bullet, huh?
Oh... yeah, totally, man.
I mean, Adrianna's a mess.
I didn't even know what I was thinking, seriously.
She has her own thing going on.
I'm not gonna worry about...
Yeah, me neither.
No biggie.
Time for roses.
Okay, so Megan.
And here's one for you, Michael.
Nika, here you go.
Another one for Megan.
Joanna.
One for Maya.
And Adrianna.
Oh, that's really sweet.
Oh, honey.
I'm getting pity flowers from the faculty.
I thought they only did that with the 12th grader in the full-body cast.
The scoliosis girl?
I think she has a boyfriend now.
- Of course she does.
- Hey, are you okay?
I guess for a second I thought it might be something romantic.
I don't know why.
I mean, obviously, I'm not anybody's idea of a great Valentine's date.
I mean, look at me.
Hey.
Hey.
For the record, you look great.
You have super boobage going on, crazy-thick hair, the dewy, glowy look that's all the rage on the runway, you've got it.
If I were going to the island of Lesbos,
- you'd be my pick.
- Thank you.
Ethan?
Oh, my gosh.
You waited?
I was going over my essay with Mr. Matthews for at least a half an hour.
It's lunch.
Aren't you starving?
Yeah.
But, I mean, what are a few hunger pains compared to what you're going through?
Which is all because of me.
So let's face it, I owe you.
Right?
But let's go before they run out of pizza and we get stuck with that stuff they pass off as meat loaf.
Ethan, wait.
There's something I have to tell you.
I just don't know how to tell you without coming off like some kind of crazy woman, which I'm not.
I swear.
What is it?
I'm feeling better than I've been letting on.
A lot better.
I've been exaggerating my injuries.
- I can carry my own bag.
- What?
I really like spending time with you.
And I just thought that if I was better, that you wouldn't wanna hang out anymore.
It doesn't matter.
I'm sorry I took advantage of you.
You're officially off the hook.
What hook?
- We're friends.
- Just because of some car accident.
Who cares how we met?
And the point is we did.
And being in the accident affected us both.
And we get each other.
And more than that, I mean, we like each other.
At least that's what I thought.
Maybe you're getting sick of me.
- No, I'm not.
- Okay.
Good.
But we have to be honest with each other from now on, because life's too short for dishonesty.
I completely agree.
I wonder where Ethan is?
Probably off discovering the meaning of life.
All right.
You gotta to help me.
I have to plan this unique Valentine's plan.
I told you, just go to the dance.
No.
Everybody's gonna go to the dance.
Okay.
Take Dixon on some romantic Valentine's dinner.
The boy loves food.
Yeah, but hasn't he been on a romantic Valentine's dinner before?
Yeah, but not in L.A. And trust me, the scene here is way different than the all-you-can-eat hot wings place in Kansas.
I'm gonna get another drink.
You want one?
- Excuse you.
- Excuse you.
Okay, I have something that's gonna help you feel better.
Tell me it's the portobello quiche I dreamt last night.
Enjoy.
This almost helps dull the Valentine pain.
You know, I've eaten at the most amazing places in the world and nothing comes close to the restaurant at my hotel.
I guess that's why there's a billion celebrities swarming there.
And, oh, my God, you should see the Valentine's Day menu they have.
- Yeah?
- It's beyond.
- Lucky you.
- Of course, I don't have a date.
To go with to the restaurant.
And why do we almost, before we've even begun to live, become dull and gray and apathetic and lazy and useless and unhappy?
Unhappy because I am nothing.
Excellent.
I mean, that's what I'm talking about.
That is it.
That's it.
Okay, who's next?
- All right, how about you?
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm Annie Wilson and I will be doing Fantine's monologue from "Les Misérables. "
Good monologue.
Desperate monologue.
A lot of pain and anguish in the class tonight.
Monsieur Javert, I beseech your mercy.
I assure you that I have done nothing wrong.
If you had been there to see it in the beginning,
- then you would have seen...
- No, no.
Stop.
Annie, this woman is desperate.
Honey, you gotta delve into your soul.
You gotta...
You gotta reach into your own desperation.
- Bring that out.
Okay?
- Yeah.
Okay.
And I swear, by the good of God, that I am not to blame.
No, go deeper.
That gentleman, the bourgeois, whom I did not know,
- put snow in my back.
- Annie, that's just louder.
- Has anyone the right
- You are about to lose everything.
To put snow down our backs while we are walking along peaceably?
- Where is your soul?
- To...
Annie?
Annie, come here.
You are about to lose your freedom and your child.
Now, perhaps you've never experienced something of that magnitude in your life, but surely there is some painful memory that you can draw on.
Some...
- You know?
- Yes, yes.
Then go there, please.
Take your time.
I am rather ill, as you see, and he had said these impertinent things to me...
Oh, okay.
That's enough.
That's enough.
Thank you.
That's just...
Let's get somebody else up there.
You're fine.
Thanks.
Why are there sugar hearts in my waffle?
I think Nat got a little carried away with the Valentine's theme.
- Is everything okay?
- Sure.
Fine.
Come on, what's wrong?
Problems in the Middle East.
Significant things like that.
Annie.
It doesn't matter.
I just wanna put it out of my head and enjoy Valentine's Day with the boy that I love.
And Rhonda?
I'm sorry.
She's early.
Early for what?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Miss, as I told you over the phone, we're completely booked.
- It's Valentine's Day.
- I know that.
Which is why I really need to get in.
I wanna take my boyfriend out for a special dinner and your restaurant is the best.
Which is why people make reservations months in advance.
Months ago, I didn't know about Valentine's Day.
No, I mean...
Okay, I knew it existed.
Look, I really wish I could help you.
Fine.
I understand.
Thank you for your patience.
Take your $10 back please.
Come on.
Restaurant.
Certainly.
Tonight?
And what time would you like to dine?
Hello?
What's that about?
Excuse me one second.
We keep a small number of tables reserved for hotel guests.
Now if you'll excuse me?
So, what are you two crazy kids gonna get up to while I'm off being tortured by my new acting teacher?
Probably just gonna go shopping.
For what?
- Clothes.
- School supplies.
I asked Rhonda to help me find you a Valentine's present.
Trying to branch out from the stuffed pentapus thing.
I feel very stupid.
Well, I should get going pretty soon anyway, but I assume I'll see you at the dance.
- Oh, I don't really do dances.
- How come?
I just had a really bad experience at one.
What happened?
Maybe she doesn't wanna talk about it, Ethan.
No, I do.
I mean, I don't but I should.
If we're being honest with each other, right?
Okay, so at my old school, there was a bunch of girls and I call them mean girls but they were so much worse than that.
It felt like their sole purpose in life was just to pick on me.
Anyway, so there was this end-of-the-year dance and this guy Danny asked me out.
And I was in shock.
I mean, I had a huge crush on him.
So my mom and I went shopping and we found this dress.
And it was blue and gauzy and it just...
It reminded me of water, of waves.
And I went to the dance and went looking for Danny.
And I found him.
Standing with those girls.
And as soon as they saw me, they just...
They all started to laugh.
Then one of the girls threw Danny a $100 bill.
Because, apparently, the whole thing was just a dare.
I felt so humiliated.
And so I took all my mom's sleeping pills.
Luckily, my mom found me in time and we moved here.
I am so sorry, Rhonda.
I have never told anybody that story before.
Well, I'm glad you told us.
Yeah, I am too.
What do you want?
I need reservations for dinner and they are booked unless you're a guest, which I'm not but you are.
I wouldn't ask except that it's Valentine's Day.
Valentine's Day?
A holiday you once referred to as:
"The greeting card mafia's stranglehold on the brainless and sentimental. "
Well, I know, but look,
I've never been in love before.
You?
In love?
Yeah.
And I want tonight to be perfect.
It has to be perfect.
And I know that there are no reasons for you to do any favors for me and we are not friends, or even frenemies, for that matter, but we were friends at one point.
When we were 12, I wrote a book report for you on "The Pearl. "
You said that you owed me one and I never collected.
I wanna collect now.
Please?
- Front desk.
- Larry, hi, darling.
It's Naomi.
Can you do me a favor?
I have a friend who needs a reservation for two at 8.
- You bet, Ms. Clark.
- Oh, thank you.
You're wonderful.
Bye now.
Just make sure you pre-order the molten chocolate cake.
They cook it while you're eating.
That's the best part of the meal.
That sounds good.
Can I buy you a drink or something to thank you?
So we should sit by the pool.
There's a really nice view.
Actually, sometimes it gets chilly out there.
- Do you wanna just sit at the bar?
- Sure.
- I'll be right with you, guys.
- Thanks.
Well, the view isn't bad here either, huh?
Just don't mention we're in high school.
Okay, I am on it.
So I said to my supervisor at the airline:
Don't talk to me like that again or I will quit and take my skills elsewhere.
Hey, Naomi.
See, that's not fair, you know my name but I don't know yours.
Liam.
So, what can I get you two?
I'll have a sparkling water.
Trying to avoid the hard stuff until I go back over the pond.
I'll just have a chamomile tea, thanks.
- What was that?
- English accents make people
- sound older.
- In what world?
- I can't stop now.
- Okay, well, less is more.
- Got it.
Make it sound...
- Seriously.
- Cheerio.
- All right.
One sparkling water.
One chamomile tea.
Thank you.
And I do appreciate that, I do.
Sure thing.
Honey?
You're awfully forward, aren't you?
For your tea.
Honey?
Oh, right.
No, thank you.
- So you're new here.
- Yep, just moved to L.A.
With your girlfriend?
If I had a girl, I wouldn't be flirting with your friend here.
Excuse me, sir?
Can we have another round?
- I gotta get back to work.
- Yes.
Sure, sure.
- And here's your change.
- Thanks.
Hey.
Hi.
What are you...?
Wow, what a coincidence.
- Yeah.
- Wait, Adrianna.
I just wanted to apologize for what happened by the lockers yesterday.
- It's fine.
- No, no, no, it's not fine.
I was a jerk and I'm sorry.
It's just the guys were talking and Nika was there and I didn't wanna make her feel bad.
But I ended up making you feel bad which is the last thing I wanted to do.
Look, it's a weird situation all around.
Trust me, I get it.
Right.
Well, the next time anybody says anything, okay, I'm gonna...
Just shut them down, Navid style.
Okay?
Yeah, and what exactly does that entail?
I'll let you know when I have that figured out.
- Okay.
- Hopefully, I'll have it worked out by the dance tonight.
Well, don't rush, I'm not going.
Sorry to bring up the dance.
Now everything's even more awkward.
No, it's not.
I'm really happy you met someone else.
I really am.
You're such a special guy.
You deserve to have fun and to go to dances and to just...
To just be normal.
And normal is not really we're I'm at right now.
Make sure that you get Nika the butter-crunch truffles because there's nothing like them in the entire world.
- Truffles?
- She'll love them.
All right.
Okay.
Have fun eating your chocolate.
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Yeah, you too.
I know, right?
That's what I thought.
This one's nice but it's just...
It's not "wow" and I'm going for "wow" or anything better than "wow. "
- Is there a word better than "wow"?
- Here, wear these.
Really?
Come here.
Thank you.
Okay, hugging me over shoes.
What has gotten into you?
You're a different person.
It's the love, man.
I'm telling you, it changes things.
It's like I see the world as this whole better place and, Naomi, I just...
I never thought that I could feel like this.
Well, I'm glad you found someone who makes you this happy.
Plus, it's been kind of cool, us hanging out again.
It has, hasn't it?
So, okay, what are you gonna do about hottie bartender?
Oh, okay, wait.
Dude, you've gotta ask him on a date tonight for Valentine's Day.
Well, it's not like I have any other plans but...
Oh, well, no, his shift just ended.
I think he said he was going home.
What if you send him a bottle of champagne with a note telling him to meet you by the pool?
Not bad.
I like it.
Exciting, exciting, exciting.
- Front desk.
- Larry.
Hi, sugar, it's me again.
Listen, I need you to do me a little unusual favor.
Any way you could have something delivered
- to one of your employee's homes?
- Bloody brilliant.
And my dad was sitting in his armchair, drinking and yelling at the TV.
He loved game shows.
And the guy on the TV gets it wrong and my dad yells at the screen:
"Even a moron would know that. " And I called out, I say:
"Well, then you must be a moron because you didn't know. "
So that's when my dad gets up out of his chair and he grabs me.
And he takes his cigarette and he grounds it out, right into my arm.
So when I need to know what pain feels like,
I got a little reminder.
Annie, why don't you come up here?
Tell us a story from your life.
Something that matters.
Okay.
Well, there was this birthday thing that happened.
This really awful girl, Naomi,
- went behind my back and...
- Annie.
Go deep.
Something really painful.
You know, something that might be hard to say out loud.
Okay.
Deeper.
Well, at my old school there are these girls who just felt like their sole purpose in life was to make me miserable.
But one day this guy Danny, who I had a huge crush on, asked me to the dance.
So my mom and I went shopping and I bought this blue dress.
And the way that it flowed down to the floor, it was like water.
I thought, you know, that it was gonna be the best day of my life, only, when I got there,
Danny was standing next to those girls.
And as soon as they saw me, they started to laugh.
Then one of the girls actually threw Danny a $100 bill because it was just a dare.
Oh, God, I don't know what I was thinking, except that...
- I wanted to stop thinking.
So I took these sleeping pills from my mom's medicine cabinet and I swallowed them all.
Because I just wanted the pain to end.
Thank you.
I knew you had it in you.
Thank you.
Ethan.
Ethan, stop, please.
Rhonda told us that in confidence because she trusted us.
- And I didn't say that it was her.
- No kidding.
You said it was you.
- How could use that as material?
- I panicked, okay?
I panicked because the teacher said, "Go deeper, go deeper. "
- Then I thought of her story.
- It wasn't a story.
It's her life.
- I know.
- You don't.
Otherwise, you never would have done that.
I can't...
I can't even look at you.
Right this way.
Yeah?
I mean, what's better than "wow"?
I don't know but there needs to be a word.
I was just thinking today how there should be a word.
Come here.
Told you I'd one up the high school dance.
Yeah, this place is pretty awesome.
Oh, just wait till you see the food.
Apparently, they have the best chef in the whole city.
Oh, and I ordered a special dessert.
You're gonna die.
What?
Just, wow.
Can I get you anything, Ms. Clark?
No, I'm all right, thank you.
I'm actually meeting someone.
- Well, just let me know if I can.
- Thank you.
I'm just saying, I've never seen my parents gush over anyone like that.
Well, it helps that they go to the same synagogue as my parents.
- Trust me, it was all you.
- It was all me.
Yeah, right.
Come on, let's dance.
It's gonna be hard to stuff down Mom's casseroles after a meal like that.
Well, as long as you saved room for dessert.
- And here is your menu.
- Oh, no, thanks.
- I pre-ordered molten chocolate cake.
- Oh, okay.
Naomi said it was the best thing she's ever tried.
Miss, are you sure you ordered it?
What?
Yeah.
I told the concierge.
I'm so sorry.
I don't have you down for one and, unfortunately, we're all out of them now.
Okay, but I ordered it.
I told him specifically that I...
Baby, it's cool.
We'll just get something else.
No.
I don't want something else.
I want the chocolate cake.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, you don't have to be sorry.
Just go get us a cake, please.
- Go get us the cake.
- Can you just give us a sec?
Honey, why are you getting so upset?
I wanted this to be perfect.
Now it's not gonna be perfect.
Silver, Silver, relax.
Listen, us being here together, me and you, that's what makes this perfect, all right?
The cake, it's just cake, all right?
And besides, I didn't even give you your gift yet.
Go ahead, open it.
You like it?
I love it.
I really love it.
- Let's get a room.
- What?
I love you and I wanna be with you.
So let's get a room.
Here.
Tonight.
Can we?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Where's Annie?
- Don't know, don't care.
- I thought you weren't coming.
- Oh, yeah.
But after what happened today, after telling you guys,
I just felt better.
I don't know.
Like, maybe I could handle it.
Well, I'm glad you're here.
And you look beautiful.
Thanks.
Sorry.
You wanna dance?
Definitely.
Hey, this is Ethan.
Leave a message.
Eth, please call me back.
I know what I did was wrong and I'm ashamed of myself.
So please just forgive me.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
I've never been more ready for anything in my life.
When you said you were bad at dancing,
I totally thought you were just kidding.
Come on.
You were just so jealous of my sweet, sweet dance moves.
Oh, so very jealous.
- Your chariot, madam.
- Thanks.
- I had a really good time.
- Yeah, yeah, me too.
It was just what I needed.
So?
Good night?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
We're friends.
- Yeah, but I thought...
- No, I have a girlfriend.
Who you broke up with.
What?
I never said that.
You didn't need to.
You danced with me the whole night, you said I looked beautiful, now you're standing here with me at the end of the dance.
I was walking you to your car.
But you looked at me like that.
Rhonda, however you think I was looking at you...
You were.
You told me to be honest with you?
Then be honest with yourself.
You were looking at me like that.
If I was, I'm sorry.
Whatever.
- Rhonda, wait.
- I'm fine.
I just gotta go home.
Come in.
What are you doing here?
Your mom let me in.
You are such a mess, Ade.
Okay, thanks for that.
You're a recovering addict, you're pregnant, and you have what I hope is chocolate smeared all over your face.
And you are a total mess.
And I couldn't care less.
You wanna know why?
Because I was at the dance tonight and everything was supposed to be perfect.
But it wasn't anywhere near perfect.
Why?
Because I wasn't with you.
So I wanted to ask you something.
Will you be my Valentine?
Yeah, I will.
Yeah?
Hold on.
I gotta...
But wait, class starts in just...
You know what, you know what?
Let's just get detention for being late so we can keep doing this after school, all right?
Come here.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
No.
I'm a little sore.
Well, okay, I was...
I was gonna wait to show it to you but who cares?
- That's...
- Your name.
I know.
So don't you go changing it or I'm gonna be really upset.
Yeah, okay.
But is it real?
Hell, yes.
I got it done on Sunday at this amazing tattoo parlor in Venice.
Come here.
I wanted to get something permanent to symbolize our love.
Okay, so who wants to come up here and solve for X?
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I wanna introduce you to a student that's gonna be joining your class.
Come on in.
All right, everybody, this is Liam Court.
Make him feel at home.
Or at school.
Anyway, carry on.
Please, take a seat.
Josie, let's have at this equation.
You're in high school?
- Thanks to you.
- What?
My mom had to sign for that bottle of champagne you sent over with the little note about how I was your favorite bartender.
Which sort of tipped her off that I wasn't enrolled here.
Well, how was I supposed to know?
I thought you were older.
Yeah?
Well, right back at you.
Tomo por mientras lo no enseñado... por la mañana:

Matthew 6:34
Carl to say something...
Let me ask you something first:
They describe me as a B?
Well, I think that.
You know what?
Carl we are 800 lbs gorilla.

We take her home, that will be better.
They will never want to leave.
Hey Gab, I switch now, okay?
I love you.
Carl it is so, listen...
I'm brand new.
I have a formula.
Change the formula and lose your listeners.
It is as simple as that.
People listen to who I am... and what I say... and nobody wants to listen to a man 's hair ball in his mouth.
This is radio.
If you want to talk, call your and talk about it.
And can you explain anyone who listens... you 't likes that The FCC thus you slijmt.
You can 't just say.
Bye.
Hurry up friend.
You owe me five.

I'm right back to questions answer... immediately after these words.
That was a close call, was it not?
Not my fault I had Gaby's brother to 't airport.
You brought my family is there.
Because you 've never asked.
Because I knew you would say no.
That is not fair, I took Gaby's brother.
You do a lot for Gaby you never did for me.
I made you my producer.
I hired you to fill the time.
Back in ten.
I brought you this far because I made us number one.
That was a part of the separation agreement.

Yes, and I will tell you why.
Please do that.
Have you ever, I mean seriously.
Have you ever seen a picture not taken from the front...
You know with 't pool on the front?
I do not make jokes now, 't make me afraid.
Consider this to:
Have you ever seen large 't there?
Well I think about it, no.
Is it real or is someone world fooled.
What do you what it is?
A cardboard sign... what is painted and onto a palace looks?
Maybe?
And that makes you?
That is why I am so paranoid.
I mean 'it's a famous palace?
I recommend it to be in India.
I do not know whether Royal residence?
Is it a sort of White House... or a Vegas casino?
You know...
I've never really there deep thought.
And I'm for... my loving friend.
For clarity and respect to create of the things we do not think.
I think: you easy can be found online.
No, make me redundant here.
You are paranoid.
Or not?
Yes, and I am not alone, therefore, they may call us and... tell you why so paranoid America?
You mean the guy who lives opposite me?
He sits on his porch knife sharpening and stare... every time I pass.
You live in a guest who his porch sharpens his knife?
Yes.
And he's creepy.
I'm afraid that he One day passes by... puts me... and then for a cup of sugar asks.
In that order?
Yes.
That is something to worry about.
Okay, the lines light up.
Why America are you so paranoid?
Caller number two:
You are now in the broadcast.
Cat.
Did h. ..
Cat.
Why does Mrs. cat food you paranoid?
I look at the different flavors they have... and I see beef 't look stand.
So you is concerned, in beef flavor cat food?
Yes.
It is a strange thing a cat to enter, do not you?
I mean, I understand chicken and fish... because that is my cat dead.
Cats kill fish?
I can imagine that you 't complex math is... but he would 't easy may in its claws.
They hunt not something dead.
You cat does not come from Texas?
If the cat food manufacturers Our cats beef perform... which will "end up then?
Who know, really?
Maybe it is, as into a film in 1970... where people use them for food?
Solid Green?
Paranoid.
Our first caller is not only paranoid but totally insane.
That is my record are is not it Gil?
I think so.
If you roast cow cat balls or ears eat, be happy.
Be glad it's not free than 49 cents per can.
I hope you think I gene who have food...
Lady, you're an idiot.
Thanks for the call.
Well there is someone who 's real has reason to be paranoid?
Caller number three:
you are now...
Heart Burn with Logan, and Bikkel Brickman.
I must admit Logan, I'm paranoid about aliens.
Aliens...
Are you afraid they the Mexican border cross beef cat and you perform?
No I see people in shows are taken to the room... and there were things stopped in their rectum.
Rectum, damn man kill them.
Please sir, This is a family show.
Sorry.
It is only...
I hear these things all the time... and it is not alone in the country... but also in the city.
They take you into their ship and experiment with u. ..
do what they please.
Have you ever heard of crop circles?
Yes, I did.
And what do you know what they are?
I do not know.
This is another good example.
Okay good.
But just for fun, what is the aim?
Perhaps it is their way for sending messages... they try to communicate with us.
I thought you would say, I knew you would say.
Let's put it this way:
If these aliens want to talk to us... communicate, say: pull... secret information from us.
Sir, you know how looks like an alien!
Aliens have a rectum?
Burck?
Have aliens that?
You sir are a moron.
If you're so paranoid about aliens, you must not watch much television.
Why our show is always alien involved in pornography?
That's what I also wonder.
Okay, we go further.
Our next caller...
Wijgerde to give his real name.
Okay, let's call him...?
Fred's your turn.
What makes you so paranoid?
Muslims.
That 's good.
Fred, would you be more specific want to be?
They blow their own for a Some of our soldiers to kill.
Much Muslims... inflated his own yet.
Maybe something else?
The way they talk?
Of their dark skin?
Their body odor.
I mean, they keep goats.
It's the fact that they are obsessed have to hate us.
You know?
Fred I think you have something.
Perhaps that is why they move to America?
Closer to us?
You ever heard to old adage:
Keep your friends close... and your enemies closer.
I mean they live in Middle East more than 10,000 years... and still they can not live together.
Have you seen them live?
I would also be jealous of America.
They live in a country full of oil.
But living in houses of beetroot The move by the smallest earthquake.
But I think that not much buildings to provide in...
In a country full of C4 and barbarians and murderers themselves.
Logan you know what your talking about?
It is his wife she would see him.
Tell her that he call back.
Gaby I call you during commercials, okay?
Military leader and hate everyone, it does not on its way.
I hear what you say sir.
Haternij is a terrible thing no one does good.
Is that not true, Gil?
-Yes...
Perhaps is it the business man who sells American flags?
Good point.
Above all, you do not fool around.
So you people hate Fred the Middle East?
I just said: anyone who does not...
So you say you hate them?
That said, I can not twist the facts, you present the words...
Since you have the people.
Fred hates Muslims.
Fred hates Arabs
Fred hates Persians.
Fred probably hate the Jews.
And this just after I have said... haternij that nobody does well.
Fred expresses his true thoughts...
America and shows real voice.
Paranoia:
Fear of the unknown... what will emerge from the shade and we will intervene... and taking away from us as we love.
Fear of Japanese technology that depends on our ears... as a claustrofobiezak.
We are right back after these messages.
- The Tashmahall... lies not in the Middle East?
What is that?
What is an ear thing?
That.
Yes.
It is a bluetooth for my cellphone!
I need to poop.
You gonna tell him that Gaby has called?
No, not yet.
We have a good evening.
Tell him:
I expect him, okay?
You say it.
I can not go.
We can not stop.
They sit right behind us.
I did what I would put out.
-You must stop here.
I want to die by their hands.
You make it without me.
Please, stop it here.
Do you want me to do?
No.
I am his brother.
I do it.
We are back in twenty.

How you leave the world is yours.
I honor you have learned.
Ask me here do not disappoint them.
I need to Gaby, she has to the car and start driving.
Where?
Everywhere, makes no difference.
- Just away.
Seriously the roads are blocked, you heard what happened on the bridge.
Tell her that the door and finally, to 'light up... and she just does not at home.
I'm sorry I did not said that she called.
Whatever.
Shit, in conversation.
Here, I will try.
- Leave it.
Burck?
Are there any callers?
Okay, you are.
Where are you man?

You sounded rather overwrought, sucker.
Well we had something to settle here.
And leave your post, that you can not do it.
We had things our plates here.
Paranoia.
What is it?
You asked for it.
I recommend that you have now, sucker.
You're an asshole.
People it seems that we nou get the news on TV.
Good evening.
This is an announcement, I do not ask.
Around 23.05 in the East... and 20:05 at the West Coast have my number been explosions at sports events... and public places throughout the country.
The report says that explosions little damage done.
There is evidence that these explosions... the beginning of the release of toxic substances in the vicinity of explosions.
We are not sure of the nature of what is released at this time.
The Center for Diseases Control.... are engaged in many tests and with their finding... as soon as possible.
Eventually it happens.
The total number of.... victims who are infected can run in the 10,000... and maybe more.
The state police... is put to work in all States.
And an immediate terrorist threat, the National red status issued.
All Americans are considered to remain calm.
Stay home and stay inside.
And turn on your television and radio broadcast for further information.
Is this all they know?
Unless they are free to advertise.
That is not logical.
How can an explosion of people together so let rip apart.
Carjacking:
Maybe if people leave as soon as possible.
My partner Gilman agrees.
You are in the broadcast.
Man I'll tell you what I know because it is much worse than you see on TV.
And I do not know why they wait?
It is obvious that everyone can see that these things are sick.
They consume us ugly quickly.
These things man... run on the street... with bleeding eyes
It is not a rebellion that I know.
I live 2 km from the arena and...
There is no Star Drag me where I may add to, you follow me?
No, I do not know what you say!
Can you be clearer?
I try.
It's like rabies.
You sometimes have a dog seen to that.
They bite and scratch you.
They have and are as fast as a rabbit.
Someone has damaged them well.
- What you say is... that this is a hondsdolheidbom?
Logan got a situation here.

Are you okay?
Yes.
No.
I seemed 'n scratch it.
Logan lie down.
Not moving.
I want to be together again.
We seek him.
Stay with me Logan.
All listeners, good morning.
They are just flying.
There are six or eight of my house.
I'm so tired.
People:
This is your host Logan Heart Burn... and we are almost done here.
It will probably a few days but...
We have... continue to survive.
I wanted to seriously thank you... for the last time.
For 't listen.
You vote.
And it most especially... for us to help... and helping each other.
You say you were a antiserum have?
Yes.
Join me in the back.
So what happens after seven hours?
- Here.
About seven hours, the virus prevail... and will be effective and will kill you fall down and destroy you... and then it's over.
You hate the government... you must not American people attacked.
The virus was designed by the USA
You saw 't.
I want clarity?
Have you heard or seen?
I would like to hide but...
I think this is my resignation.
My producer is left now the world relief organization.
All our hope is to her... something that they think of 'n.... solution for this virus.
At this moment, I just but my family.
Gaby?
Gil?
Gaby?
I'm so glad you're okay.
10,000 years... in the history of mankind.
Millions of years of evolution... and still we are building something... what more to destroy than to create.
That circle of inventions...
A knife for the community... literally a knife.
And not just a community... but humanity.
We are all victims... the same terrible impulses.
And we show how to find... to store and recharge our energy into something positive... and to resist the darkness.
God help us all.
Sturmer.
So, how was the funeral?
You know, the usual.
Close the lid.
Cover with dirt.
-Any of your female cousins there?
-Not really.
-Get any phone numbers?
-No.
-What have you been up to?
-A lot.
-Who's that next to Leibnitz?
-His noble mother.
-Our little prince.
-What did you do?
Women don't get horny until they're 30.
They get their kicks by wielding power over men and only enjoy sex when they start to wilt.
-Really?
-Really.
Did you cry?
We want to know what it's like.
-I didn't cry.
Did you?
-No, I've never been to a funeral.
Dyrbusch.
Bogatsch.
-Breathe into this.
-I'm sober, officer.
That's what you think, big shot.
Leibnitz.
Well?
Wonderful.
Next.
Was the hunt a success, gentlemen?
It works.
Okay, thanks.
My condolences.
Was it your father's or mother's side?
-Mother's.
-Okay.
How is she coping?
-All right.
-Good.
-I'll unpack.
-Wait.
Before you unpack...
You had special leave but I can't make exceptions.
-Fill it up.
-Can I do it later?
Sure.
No problem.
Konstantin, you can always come to me.
The fall from grace.
The moment human beings learn good from bad they are like God and God fears that.
The serpent is sneaky and tells the couple they have to eat it.
The woman eats it and persuades Adam to do so too.
Are you listening?
Sturmer!
-You get it, don't you?
-Yes, of course.
Man lost his innocence, or paradise, before eating from the Tree of Knowledge.
He lost it when he was told not to.
Get it?
No, I don't follow.
Speaking of paradise, shall we take Sturmer with us to the dacha?
What dacha?
Our countryside summer residence.
Count me in.
It's not that simple.
Go on.
No fiig leaf.
I deem
Sturmer worthy.
Joining us or not?
Leibnitz is chicken.
Want to go back?
No.
We're almost there.
Wow!
What is this place?
How did you arrange all this?
The chairs are comfy.
I just went to the campsite manager and said I needed a dacha.
His eyes lit up and he made scores of suggestions.
Just acting in accordance with his assigned role as service provider.
Spontaneously.
Fascinating.
For a small tip he'll do more than that.
Cheers.
Drink up.
Your attention, please.
We have assembled today to eternally renounce living a lie and public school kid stuff.
Self-denial, morals, discipline.
Social service.
Bullshit!
That's not reality.
Cheers.
We are what we are, have what we have and must go forward.
Starting right now.
We have undreamed-of opportunities.
Like this place.
We must defend our fort with all means.
It's our secret.
Everyone agreed?
.
Anyone who talks has had it.
A retreat.
A playground.
A secluded, exclusive think tank.
-And a place to fuck.
-To fucking!
Cheers.
What else have we got here?
Dumped by our parents.
In the middle of nowhere.
I'll square with you.
You're my family.
By the way, Dyrbusch, "Think tank!"
Bullshit.
Muff.
And money.
They're our objectives.
Okay, Bogatsch.
Muff and money.
But take a look at yourself.
What would you have to do to attain these objectives if you weren't Bogatsch but a normal creep?
That's what interests me.
Good.
Let's play the game.
Longings of a Creep versus Muff and Money.
What are you willing to do to improve your lot in life?
Concretely.
Concretely?
I...
I can't help it.
I didn't have a chance.
Nobody wants to help me.
Where is your self-respect, your self-discipline?
How do you think you'll make it like that?
Come.
If that's how he wants it you accept the offer.
Bark properly.
Be a doggy.
A real doggy.
Bark like a dog.
Like a dog!
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
I want a doggy.
Come on!
Bark!
Bark like a dog.
Do it right.
Sturmer, get off my hand!
Keller, Lehmann.
You were arguing again in the hall after 11 p.m. last night.
It's starting to piss me off.
Were you in the hall?
-Know anything?
-No.
Then it's okay.
It was about a lid.
Some lid or other.
I have no idea what kind.
But that's no reason to wake me in the middle of the night.
I'd ask you to take that to heart and not disturb my night's rest.
Now for ourwork assignments in the coming week.
Sturmer, Abbaz: rubbish.
Bogatsch, Erler:
washrooms and toilets.
Leibnitz, Dyrbusch: kitchen duty.
Klos, Lindemann:
common room and hallway.
Now for the mail.
One letter for von Leibnitz.
Well?
Well?
Well?
Yes.
Thanks.
And this packet for Sturmer.
Don't open until tomorrow.
It's bad luck.
Stop!
Stop, gentlemen.
Wait.
Just a minute, please.
Don't forget to sign out.
Signing out, very important.
-Sparkling wine, four glasses?
-Here.
20 euros, please.
Could you put it on the table?
In the corner.
-How much was it?
-20.
Keep the change.
-Have a nice evening.
-You too.
Apologize to the lady.
Let's go.
That won't do any good.
-lt isn't broken, is it?
-Be careful!
I'll kill that wanker.
Is that for me?
-lt has what it takes.
-Guys!
We can't do that.
If they find out we'll be expelled.
Problem: urine test.
Solution...
fill bottles with clean piss.
Keep them in a fridge in your room.
Pass the test.
-Whose piss?
-What did you contribute to the party?
-Not me.
-Listen.
-First little piggy has a birthday.
-That would be me!
Second little piggy sorted out the goods.
Third little piggy provides the plan.
The fourth donates body fluid.
We'll have to heat it before handing it in.
-He won't know the difference.
-Good.
Follow his example.
-That's constructive.
-I'm drunk.
The test only detects drugs.
It's just a little leak.
You act like Satan wants your soul.
-I don't want to.
-Sturmer, take your share.
Come on.
It's cold!
Let her by.
She's headed my way.
Jump, jump, jump!
Get out of here!
Hey, you're wet.
-What?
-Nothing.
Here come a few more.
Well?
Are you off for the night?
-Did your nose stop bleeding?
-Yes.
Was he your boyfriend?
-Maybe.
-He was in a funny mood.
-Think so?
-Have you spent everything?
-Shall I carry your bag?
-No, thanks.
-What's your name?
-Vaneska.
Vaneska.
That's a pretty name.
Isn't it risky walking by the lake alone?
-Why should it be?
-Just wondering.
You're naked.
I'm dressed.
You don't say!
Cool it.
Give her a chance.
Say, do you feel like playing a little game with us?
What kind of game?
-What game?
-Know why we're here?
One of us is celebrating his birthday.
I thought you might like...
Wait.
You might like to guess who it is.
And guess what the prize is.
-You can go.
Otherwise you can't.
-I don't want to go.
Try and guess anyway.
Not you.
Not you.
I've seen you somewhere before.
That's enough.
Let her guess.
-Guess!
Guess!
-Come on.
-Play.
-Kiss my arse!
-I'd love to.
-I really should go.
-I have to go.
-Don't go.
You'll get your prize in a minute.
-I don't give a shit who turned 18!
-Give her a chance.
Let me go!
Keep quiet.
Quiet.
Nobody will hurt you.
I'm letting you loose.
Pigs!
No!
-Dyrbusch.
-Just for a little while.
-lt won't take long.
-Help!
Help!
-Just a little bit.
-No!
This is fucked-up!
You pig!
You pig!
Are you crazy?
That was my fiirst time.
For what?
Snorting coke.
It was crystal.
Congratulations, anyway.
We were on the verge of something indescribable.
It would have been a thrill to see her go for broke.
Just when it was getting fun, you copped out.
Prince Leibnitz seized the chance and shafted us.
He didn't mean to.
He didn't understand your fun.
Neither did I.
What's your goal, Konstantin?
Just a little fun?
Or everything and more.
We should decide how to do it differently next time.
Ambiguous rubbish.
So you can screw us next time?
Nonsense!
Leibnitz will apologize.
To Bogatsch too.
How many times have you apologized?
It's meaningless.
We have to decide once and for all who's with us and who isn't.
And take appropriate steps.
And set rules for the eventuality that one of us cocks things up.
We can do that.
That's precisely what we'll do.
I'll sum it up.
Leibnitz sniffed coke.
We all did.
He lost control of himself.
He made fools of us.
But he's terribly sorry.
He wants to apologize.
He wants the group to stay together.
So he deserves a second chance.
Right?
Good, Sturmer.
-Does the accused have a final plea?
-Guilty on all counts.
Cheers.
Time for some fun.
But what you did yesterday was really crap.
It was just a bit offun.
You just don't understand.
In what way concretely do you intend to make amends?
Today we embrace a fruit of the modern age.
Civilized white torture.
Clean torture.
It leaves no marks.
Are you listening?
Today's special.
Tickling until you faint.
Leibnitz, what's wrong?
Or laughing to death.
Give me a hand!
Not in his face.
What about you?
Mum!
No!
No!
Want more?
Harder.
You haven't finished your meal.
Why should we eat it?
Eating all the time?
-That hurts!
-Good morning.
The good boy is here.
-How can anyone be so rough?
-Stop it, Gran.
Gran.
Careful.
Careful.
We'll do that later.
I'll roll you over.
Nice and easy.
Have you two met?
She's my granddaughter, Vaneska.
But now the good boy is here.
Always there when you need him.
Yes.
Take care of yourself, Gran.
-When will you be back?
-Soon.
Wait a minute!
That night we wouldn't really have...
Done what?
Coward!
-Wait!
-What planet do you live on?
Think you can take anything you want?
Dad forks out a fat cheque and it's all forgotten.
Who are those arseholes you hang out with?
That pompous guy.
That sycophantic coward.
And you're Miss Perfect, are you?
Pay more attention to your grandmother.
I see her twice a week.
You, once a year.
-ls that relevant?
-Absolutely.
Kiss my arse!
You kiss my arse!
They're my friends.
-We went a bit too far.
-What's that?
We went too far.
I'll report you to the police.
You know you won't.
I don't know what goes on in your heads, but it scares me.
Happy belated 18th birthday.
He didn't hurt you.
I bumped into Vaneska.
Who?
You know.
The girl at the lake.
What did you tell her?
-Nothing.
Don't worry.
-I'm not worried.
Are you going to the dacha tonight?
-Coming?
-Yes.
Everything all right?
.
Why do you let them treat you that way?
You got a screw loose?
Tell me right now why you let them do it!
-Stay out of it.
They're basket cases.
-What are you?
What are you?
What the hell do they need you for?
Why?
Why do you go along with it?
I was hoping you'd make other suggestions besides going to Monaco, which is really a bit too far.
In other words I took it upon myself to reflect upon the subject and came up with the idea oftravelling to Dresden this coming Saturday.
To extend our cultural horizons.
Right.
Here are the details.
We'll leave on Saturday.
Klos, Lindemann!
Could you focus for a minute and have the courtesy to let me finish my briefing?
7 a.m. alarm call on Saturday.
Breakfast together at eight.
At nine we gather out front and take a bus to see the city.
The Zwinger, the green castle dome, and time permitting, the Church of Our Lady.
It's supposed to be grand after reconstruction.
That's it fortoday.
Thank you.
Leibnitz.
We have to meet.
-No.
-Yes.
-Where?
-All right.
On the dam.
We have private counselling.
Did you forget?
Come in.
Your record is brilliant as always.
But performance and concentration are only one side of the coin.
If you neglect the world around you you stop living.
If you shut other people out, what's life worth?
-Nothing.
-You see.
This isn't an examination.
There's no right or wrong answer.
We can exchange views frankly here.
What's getting to you?
Is it the death in the family?
It wasn't my idea.
Leibnitz and I just went along.
And...
At first it was all harmless.
And...
Then we were at the lake.
A young lady came by.
She flirted with us.
She kissed me.
-One thing led to the other.
-What's her name?
Vaneska.
Great, Konstantin!
Don't look at me like that.
Don't forget,
I was your age once.
The confusing feelings, ups and downs.
You don't know how.
You don't know why.
Konstantin, become more active.
Get involved, participate.
It will work out.
What did he want?
Nothing.
You have to tell him.
No.
Why not?
Do you know what they'd do to us?
How should I know?
All I know is this has to stop.
You have to end it.
You have to put a stop to it.
They'll lay off one day.
No, they won't.
Here you are.
We have an appointment.
I'm not coming.
You're not coming?
What's wrong?
What do you want me for?
We'd like to know what you want us for.
What a load of rubbish.
What's next on the agenda?
-Let him go!
-No.
"Appropriate steps." Those were your words.
You told me that here.
Remember?
You're a stupid arsehole!
Now, now.
No insults.
We only did what you were too afraid to do.
You should thank us.
You understand?
It was you who put the little prince in his predicament.
-Me?
-Yes.
You're in deep.
I'm telling you!
Did you fuck?
Come on!
Now he's finished!
Now he's finished!
And you're scared of the consequences again.
He's going to snuff it and you can't handle it.
You're chicken!
Bogatsch, he stopped moving!
Shit.
Shit.
Do something!
-It's your fault!
-Bogatsch!
-You killed him.
-Just get help!
Don't just stand around!
Go for help!
Come in, Sturmer.
From now on count me out.
I won't squeal on you.
But I'm out of this.
And you leave Leibnitz alone, okay?
No, it's not okay.
No deal.
Nobody's going anywhere.
No copping out over the barrel.
What do you suggest?
Should he beat himself?
Besides, I think it's a great experience for each of us.
-lt is for me at least.
-For me too.
And if you're honest, Sturmer, for you too.
Fuck you!
Sturmer is right.
But the political mood in eastern Germany...
Carry on, gentlemen.
Leibnitz, do you have a minute for me?
-Yes.
-Then come along.
You wouldn't do that at home.
What ifhe blabs?
You still don't get it.
Our little prince.
The richest of us all.
Aristocratic.
Gifted.
Listen.
He wants to belong.
To be indispensable.
To be a sheep among sheep.
He won't blab.
I promise.
What's wrong with you?
It's really about time to tell the truth.
Don't make it hard for yourself.
Come on.
All right.
You can't escape your problems by inducing imaginary states of mind.
By losing sight of reality.
Why, Konstantin, do people who can have anything go to a dominatrix to be flogged with a cat-o'-nine-tails?
Look it up.
I have it under control.
Bogatsch has it under control.
But do you have yourself under control?
Drugs are no answer.
I don't take drugs.
That can't be true.
I want to know who it was.
Who was it?
Listen to me.
They saw you when you were jogging.
You are the freak with no friends.
And you're up to here in shit.
Because I want it that way.
What a pity.
But that can be checked.
Come on, Leibnitz.
Leave morals out of it.
You don't know the score.
They can't pin anything on us.
Come tonight and you're one of us.
Please.
Just a minute.
Leave the door open.
I want to go home.
I'll look the other way.
What's the matter with you?
Leibnitz, wait a second.
I can't do it.
See you tonight at the dacha.
No.
-Just fill up this tube.
That's all.
-I want to go home.
Come on, Leibnitz.
-I won't do it.
-Yes, you will.
I'm not doing it!
-I want to go home!
-lt will be all right.
-I want to go home!
-Everything's all right.
Come to me.
It's okay.
-It's only me.
-Please, I don't want to.
What's that?
Show me that.
What is that?
I want to go home.
I want to go home!
I want to go home!
Leibnitz!
What happened?
Copyright @ 2008 TITELBILD, Berlin Subtitles:
Alan Wildblood et al.
Bye.
Bye.
CHRIS:
When you're a kid, one of the most important lessons you learn is when your parents tell you to do something...
Y'all better eat that liver.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
...you do it no matter what you think...
Boy, get your feet off my good chair.
Yes, ma'am.
...no matter what it is.
Girl, are you crazy?
!
You want to cook your brother, do it outside.
Yes, ma'am.
( muffled yelling )
No matter how you feel.
Chris, clear off the table and do the dishes.
( both laughing )
No.
( tires screeching, crashing sounds )
( all gasp )
What?
CHRIS:
Will I say what I said again?
Will my mother kill me before I get a chance to say it?
Are Drew and Tonya gonna sit there and just let this happen?
Don't touch that dial.
* Aw, make if funky now *
CHRIS:
After saying no to my mother for the first time,
I didn't know what to expect.
What did you say?
I said no.
Twice.
That's what I thought you said.
Now say it again.
Mom, I didn't eat all the dinner by myself.
I shouldn't have to clean it all up by myself.
I don't wear all the clothes, but I wash them by myself.
I don't sleep in all the beds inthis house, but I make them up by myself.
I don't pee in all of the toilets in this house by myself!
Mom, Drew and Tonya sitting right there doing nothing.
Why can't they help?
Because I told you to do it.
Now I don't want to hear no more back talk.
Now clean this mess up.
No.
I'm not gonna do it.
Lord... please help me before I knock this boy's neck off.
Eight...
Nine...
T-
- Ten!
CHRIS:
I wouldn't see a woman that perplexed again until Palin found out her daughter was knocked up.
Now are you gonna clean up this table or do I need to tell your father?
CHRIS:
Whenever there was a problem my mother couldn't handle, she'd call my father for backup, like the governor bringing in the National Guard.
Ow!
What's the situation?
!
Chris won't do what I told him.
You want me to do some dishes?
!
I'll do some dishes!
( screaming wildly )
I'll handle this.
Oh!
That was my...
( launcher beeps )
Yes!
( crowd cheering )
You know what?
Go ahead.
Tell him.
I don't care.
Fine.
Drew, Tonya, come clean this table up and wash the dishes.
BOTH:
Yes, ma'am.
CHRIS:
I enjoyed time with my father, but I was afraid this might be the last time.
Where have you been?
I stopped to get coffee.
CHRIS:
With his coffee coupon.
Oh, coffee.
Oh, yeah, that-that's nice.
Well, while you were out taking your time sipping on coffee, uh, your son was here staging a coup!
A coup?
What?
Who, Drew?
Chris!
I spent 20 hours of labor pushing out that big-eared boy, and he turns around and does this to me?
!
Does what?
What did he do?
What did he do?
Oh, what?
You're on his side now?
!
No, no, I'm just trying to find out what's going on.
Oh, what's going on, what's going on.
Let me think about what's going on.
Your son is trying to kill me.
That's what's going on!
I-I cook, I clean, I care for this family, and what do I get in return?
Just a full-scale mutiny!
Led by a child who I bore for a man who's supposed to love and honor and protect me!
You know, I thought we were all in this together, but you know what?
I'm finding out now that I'm just by myself!
Rochelle, what did he do?
I told Chris to wash the dishes.
And he told me, "No."
And what do you do?
Nothing!
CHRIS:
While my father was trying to figure out what to do,
I was starting to realize what I had done.
What are you doing here so early?
It's a long story.
Why you here?
I'm always here for breakfast.
So what happened?
I talked back to my mother, she's telling my father, and I had to get out the house before he got home.
What were you thinking?
She's always making me do work while Drew and Tonya sit around like it's a hotel.
I mean, why do I have to be a maid?
Do I look French?
Do I have on a black skirt with a white apron?
CHRIS:
That's a whole other type of maid.
You're a fool.
Mothers do have limits.
I mean, there's only so much they can take.
You know, one day you just refuse to do the housework, and then the next day you wake up, and there's some Italian lady naked in your kitchen at midnight eating all your spumoni ice cream,
and your dad comes out and he's, like,
"Hey, just, you know, go back to bed.
Forget all about it, Greg."
Well, after my dad knocks my brains out,
I won't have to worry about remembering anything.
CHRIS:
While I was trying to savor my last day of life,
Mr. Omar was trying to savor a last meal.
So, the next thing I know, the doctors call and say I've gone from a clean bill of health to who knows how much time left to live.
( laughs )
BOTH:
Tragic.
You see, most people are decapitated by flying hubcaps.
( laughs )
Or fall down a flight of steps and get strangled between banister rails.
So knowing when I'm gonna die allows me to make the most of my remaining days and get my affairs in order.
CHRIS:
And he doesn't mean business affairs.
So from now on, I'm gonna do the things
I want to do and say the things
I want to say without worrying about the consequences.
( door shuts )
Hey, Mr. Omar.
Oh, hey, Mr. Julius.
Unfortunately, I'm here to give my 19-day notice.
You moving out?
Mm, no, more like moving on.
Where you going?
Well, that's the great mystery of life, isn't it, Mr. Julius?
Where do we go when we die?
Dying?
Mr. Omar, that's terrible.
Oh, no, it's not.
'Cause for the next 19 days, I'm gonna be living it up!
Pass me the meatballs.
Okay.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, where's Chris?
Chris said he had to work late.
Good, then he'll be home soon.
ROCHELLE:
Julius, your son is trying to kill me.
Go find him and stop him.
CHRIS:
With my father on the way to Doc's,
I was a dead man working.
( shrieks )
We need to talk.
I just need to understand why you would talk to your mother like that.
Dad, Drew and Tonya were sitting down watching TV, and I'm the only one Mom said to go clean up.
It's just not fair.
You raised me to stand up for myself, so why do I get in trouble when I do it at home?
Look, Chris, you might win the battle, but you're gonna lose the war.
Sometimes it's not about just being right.
Hey, look, you need to apologize to your mother.
Why?
Because she will make your life miserable.
You know how many times I've been right and still had to apologize?
469,531 times.
CHRIS:
And counting.
How is that even possible?
Because she doesn't care.
It doesn't make any sense.
Exactly.
Look, that's the #1 rule of living with women:
nothing makes sense.
When you learn this, then you'll finally understand what it is to be a man.
Wrong or right, you still have to be sorry.
CHRIS:
I had survived the walk home.
Now all I had to do was apologize, and my life would go back to normal.
So did you talk to him?
I talked to him.
Good.
Chris, clean up the table and do the dishes.
No.
CHRIS:
Well, it's been nice knowing you, America.
CHRIS:
I had put my foot down.
But unfortunately, it was into my own grave.
So I thought you talked to him?
I did.
And he's got a point.
What?
!
Why should Drew and Tonya watch TV while Chris cleans up their mess?
I do not have to explain to him why I do the things that I do.
If I want him to do something that I don't want the other kids to do,
I probably have a good reason!
And do you have a good reason?
No.
But that doesn't matter!
He's growing up, Rochelle.
If you ask him to do something that seems unfair, he's gonna want to know why.
You wanted a strong-minded kid, well, you got one.
Oh.
Okay, I-I see.
Oh, if he wants to be grown, then he's grown.
Fine.
CHRIS:
How come when a woman says "fine,"
it's never actually fine?
First thing in the morning, my mother did the meanest thing yet: nothing.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I'm late for school.
You're grown.
Wake yourself up.
You don't want to do nothing for me,
I ain't doing nothing for you.
CHRIS:
And she didn't.
She didn't do my laundry.
Where are my underwear?
You're grown.
Wash your own drawers.
She didn't make my meals.
Where's my breakfast?
You're grown.
You can cook your own food.
While my mother was teaching me a lesson about life,
Mr. Omar was giving out lessons about death.
And I also will take that helmet and those death darts.
That's a Crock-Pot and pens, man.
Not in the jungle, it's not.
You know, I can make a hand grenade out of a can of Cheez Whiz and a dress sock.
Well, you need to use it to blow your own brains out.
Don't they have centers for people like you?
Bye.
Excuse me.
Hey, Monk.
Hey, Julius.
MR. OMAR:
Hey, aloha, Mr. Julius.
You can't have all these people in the hallway.
What you gonna do about it?
I'm dying.
Mr. Omar, these people are turning my house into a fire hazard.
Well, with all that asbestos in the walls and ceiling, you ain't got to worry about no fire.
It's the asthma that's gonna kill you.
Excuse me?
You're cheap!
You're a bald-headed, penny-pinching skinflint.
Watch yourself, Mr. Omar.
What's to watch?
!
I'm dying.
CHRIS:
While my father was thinking about breaking a lamp over Mr. Omar's head,
I was trying not to break down.
Dude, you look terrible.
I know.
It was a rough morning.
Mom decided she's not gonna do anything for me anymore.
Barely made it to school.
If you back down now, you'll miss the one chance you have to make sure your voice is heard.
I know.
All I have to do is stick it out just a little bit longer.
She's been mad at me before, and she'll be mad at me again.
What's she gonna do, not be my mother anymore?
( woman speaking indistinctly over P.A. )
I'd like to return this child.
Do you have the receipt?
Sure do.
Looks good.
Take this to the cashier for your refund.
Thank you.
CHRIS:
I was trying to become my own person, but my mother still thought she owned me.
What you think you're doing?
I'm making breakfast.
With my eggs?
No, I bought the eggs, and I bought the bacon.
Oh.
( chuckles )
Well, you ain't buy that skillet.
You ain't buy that fire.
You ain't buy that spatula.
You ain't buy that plate.
Next time, I'll remember to buy a paper plate.
Ooh!
Next time?
Oh, next...? "Oh, next time, I'll remember to buy a paper..."
No, next time, you need to remember this ain't your kitchen!
This ain't your stove.
This ain't your floor.
Those ain't your frozen gizzards.
That ain't your...!
You say none of this is mine, maybe I should find someplace else to be.
Uh-oh!
Did y'all see that?
I guess he jumping bad now.
You bad!
I guess you Shaft!
You's a bad mother-- Shut your mouth!
No.
Since you're so independent, so liberated, maybe you need to go live in the Statue of Liberty.
Fine.
I'm leaving.
CHRIS:
I stood my ground, and now I was gonna be standing out on the street.
I left the house before my mother asked for her suitcase back.
DREW:
Just say you're sorry.
What for?
TONYA:
Because you just got kicked out.
Look, I don't care, all right?
It's better than doing everyone else's work.
If you had been cleaning up after me for the past ten years, you'd know how I felt.
How you gonna eat?
I-I got a job.
Where you gonna stay?
I'll find a place.
Will you quit being stupid, and go clean the kitchen like Mama told you?
Look, if you want it clean so bad, you go do it.
So you're really leaving?
Yeah.
Well, can I have your radio?
Fine.
Good luck, Chris.
ROCHELLE:
Yeah, since this morning.
I mean, you know, it's not a big deal, but if Chris calls, can you let me know?
Okay.
Thanks, Doc.
Why is this table such a mess?
CHRIS:
Somebody fired the maid.
'Cause I'm not gonna clean it up.
They're not gonna clean it up.
When I find him, Chris is gonna clean it up.
When you find him?
Chris and Mom got into another fight.
And she threw him out of the house.
What do you mean, you threw him out?
I may have implied that since he was so self-sufficient, that maybe he should live someplace else.
And then he left.
You telling me you kicked our son out because he didn't do the dishes?
CHRIS:
Exactly.
Not exactly.
But it's the principle, Julius!
Do you know what the words "too far" mean?
CHRIS:
Actually, she didn't.
You're cutting the boy's arm off for sticking his finger in the fan.
What?
Cutting off his arm?
I don't get it.
So am I the fan?
I'm pretty sure Chris is the arm.
No, I think the arm is the arm.
Chris is the boy.
Yeah, Chris is the boy.
Look, sticking his finger in the fan is just the equivalent of doing something stupid.
Like talking back to Mom.
Right.
So cutting the arm off is kicking him out of the house?
Exactly.
So if he stuck his finger in the fan, and I didn't like it, cutting his arm off so he wouldn't do it again wouldn't help.
Wouldn't help.
Oh.
Oh.
Got it.
I'm-I'm gonna go find Chris.
It's Saturday.
He probably just went someplace in the neighborhood to cool off.
CHRIS:
Hopefully, not under a fan.
While my dad was talking sense into his woman, a woman was talking some sense into me.
Boy, are you crazy?
You are lucky she just threw you out.
But, V-- Chris, you challenged her authority.
You left her no choice.
So if me or Tonya say no, are you just gonna kick us out, too?
CHRIS:
Yes!
No.
I didn't kick him out, Drew.
He left.
CHRIS:
After you kicked him out.
He only left because you told him to go live in the Statue of Liberty.
CHRIS:
Okay, how am I supposed to talk to her if she won't listen to anything I say?
Chris, you are a child.
Parents don't negotiate with children.
Even though I hate Chris,
I still wish he would come back home.
I don't want him to get stabbed or shot or turned out or hooked on drugs.
Your brother is not gonna get hooked on drugs.
Actually, he probably will.
Runaways tend to fall into dangerous situations pretty quickly.
And drugs and alcohol provide a sedative to the trauma and isolation.
Chris, you need to go back home.
Why?
It's just gonna happen again.
What if he doesn't come back?
If he does, it's just gonna happen again.
You know, if it was me and it was my kid,
I think I would've thought of a different way to say what I said, so that my kid still learned his lesson while keeping our family together.
VANESSA:
It's dishes!
You're acting like she told you to bring down the mob!
CHRIS:
Actually, the mob was slightly less vindictive than my mother.
Hey, Vanessa.
Chris, let's go.
While me and my mother were still bent out of shape,
Mr. Omar was about to straighten something out.
Oh, hey, Mr. Julius!
Chris, go upstairs.
And don't say anything to your mother till I get up there.
I don't want her throwing you out again.
( chuckles )
Hey, Chris!
What?
Um, I was wondering had you rented my apartment yet.
You forgot to say, "bald-headed skinflint."
Yeah.
About that:
I just wanted to say I'm very sorry.
Whatever.
What difference is it to you whether I rented the place anyway?
Won't you be dead?
Uh, no, no.
Uh, turned out, there was a mistake.
I got Mr. Watkins' prognosis, and he got mine.
Who is Mr. Watkins?
He's the guy that's dying instead of me.
( laughs )
Yeah, misdiagnosed with a terminal condition by a doctor with a nearsighted nurse.
Tragic.
Tragic!
Well...
I guess that's good news.
Uh, look, look, look, Mr., Mr. Julius,
Mr. Julius.
I was speaking my mind, but my mind wasn't in the right place.
So you don't think I'm a bald-headed--
( screams )
Don't say it!
Don't you ever say that.
You're a good man, Mr. Julius.
Mr. Omar, next time you think you're dying, before you start calling people names, be sure.
Rent's due on the first.
( chuckles )
Hallelujah!
All right, first of all, in the future, no kid gets thrown out of the house unless we both throw them out.
Second, your mother's in charge.
When she tells you to do something, you do it.
You got it?
I'm talking to everybody here.
Now, do we all understand?
ALL:
Yes.
Good.
Chris, apologize to your mother.
I'm sorry.
JULIUS:
Sorry for what?
Mom, I'm sorry for being disrespectful and talking back to you.
JULIUS:
Good.
Rochelle?
Rochelle.
( sighs )
Chris, I'm sorry for being unreasonable.
I know I was unfair.
JULIUS:
Okay.
This is over and done.
Chris, give your mother a hug.
I'm sorry, baby.
I love you.
I'm sorry, too, Mom.
JULIUS:
Great.
Drew, Tonya, go watch TV.
Chris, clean this mess up.
Yeah, baby!
* Everybody hates Chris *
[thunder claps] [music]
When men were to take up arms, the predominant object was the sword.
'Cause when I have done sword fights in movies,
I've always thought about:
What are they for?
Often these things were right at the point of history.
They're such a part of our cultural heritage.
[hammer striking] [music]
The Medieval and Renaissance blade, a profound and beautiful object handcrafted by master artisans of old.
It is designed to kill.
The truth of the sword has been shrouded in antiquity and the Renaissance martial arts that brought it into being are long forgotten.
The ancient practitioners lent us all that they knew through their manuscripts.
As gunslingers of the Renaissance they were the westem heroes with swords.
They lived and died by them.
Yet today, their history remains cloaked under a shadow of legend.
Before the invention of gunpowder, the sword was the weapon of the time.
The sword probably has not been a relevant weapon for at least 200 years.
To think that a pummel, a handgrip, a crossbar, a blade, a very simple object could hold such sway over thousands of years of human evolution.
These objects have really controlled our history and where we are today.
Swords have been used throughout history to defend people and land, to build nations and to protect kingdoms from tyranny.
From 1st century wars against Rome to the Viking and Norman conquests, sword and steel have changed the fate of kingdoms, the map of Europe and ultimately the timeline of world history.
Their essential role in preserving freedom and honor goes back far into the dim mists of history.
The connection between sword and freedom may perhaps find its origin within the customs of the Germanic and Celtic tribes.
Here, being armed with a sword was not only a right but also a duty of all free men.
In fact, the ceremony for giving freedom to a slave required that the former slave be presented with the armament of a free man.
Many British kings chose to trust their subjects with arms and to supplement the militia in times of need rather than abolish it.
The idea of a free militia versus a financed army presents an interesting concept that is reflected in many of our modem films.
The sword is as relevant today as a symbol as it was in ages past, being found within statues, civic emblems, and insignia both ancient and modern.
It has been an ancient symbol for words spoken in truth, for purity, justice and the spirit of God.
The iconic power of the sword is everywhere within our culture from literature to popular entertainment and nowhere is it more celebrated than in the modern cinema.
There's a definite symbolism that's part and parcel of every story containing a sword.
The sword combines power, authority, and the threat of impending violence all in a prop, which might be hanging off somebody's side until the moment they draw it.
I think there's something more intimate about two guys going at it with swords.
To fight someone with a sword as opposed to shooting someone with a gun, I think it takes more courage.
It's conflict at its most raw where you've got two characters
looking at each other eye to eye engaging at that level.
And the stakes are higher it could go either way.
You are right there in the end and the sword, in many ways, is an extension of that character's arm so it's really a sharpened fist.
It suddenly is a realm of myth, of legend, of heroes, of adventures.
That would explain to a large degree the popularity of swords.
They're, you know, an integral part of it.
Our technology has progressed far beyond needing the sword as an object of personal defense, and while it's still irrelevant, don't you think it's interesting the extent to which we seem to still have the image of the sword, the concept of the sword,
the symbolic importance of the sword.
I mean, it's hard to turn on the television or go to the cinema, it seems, without still being surrounded by swords.
[music]
Our stories and movies contain the kind of morality and justice that we only wish we could find in the real world.
I've had the honor really-- I have to say it like that--
I've had the honor really-- I have to say it like that-- of working with Bob Anderson as my swordmaster.
In all of the fights that I did on film as a coach, and indeed as a modern fencer, has undoubtedly been my life, swordplay.
Others who have worked with him feel like I do, that you always want to give 100% to live up to the choreography that he comes up with.
Even his presence, just him walking on the set, suddenly you have to pick up your game a bit, you know.
The first time I met Bob Anderson was actually on the set of "Lord of the Rings."
He turns around and introduces himself and says,
"Well, I'm going to show you a few things that might save your life today, mate."
And so he proceeded to show me some basic blocking and thrusting and cutting moves with the sword.
And the guy who came after him to show me some more says,
"Oh, do you realize who that was?"
And I was like, "No, I don't."
"Well, that's Bob Anderson.
"He, you know, he used to train Errol Flynn and you know, has worked for years in the industry."
And I said, "Oh really, is that so?"
Why don't you give up?
You can see I'm a better swordsman
Errol Flynn was a very talented, athletic actor who could do anything if he set his mind to it.
And that's why he became a swordsman, I think, is because the parts that were getting the publicity in those days-- sword fighting and stuff-- fighting at the end, and you know,
Douglas Fairbanks stuff as it was called in those days.
Then he said, "Oh, and he was Darth Vader."
He was actually in Darth Vader's costume actually doing all the light saber work.
And I was like... that sort of struck a resonance with me, you know.
Oh, Darth Vader, yes.
It's just a cloak and a helmet that I was underneath it all.
I did choreograph the fights.
I did three of those.
It was good work for me.
It became the weapon of choice in that series of films.
Indeed even, it seems when somebody's making a science-fiction movie and off in space they can't seem to escape from the sword.
I wonder why that is?
What is it?
It's your father's light saber.
This is a weapon of a Jedi knight.
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.
An elegant weapon for a more civilized age.
To go into the future and then think about laser swords, that's brilliant.
Suddenly "Star Wars" is not just a sci-fi movie, it's also a modern version of a hero legend.
"The Princess Bride" was one of the best fights and everybody tells me it was one of the best fights
I've choreographed.
You seem like a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.
You seem like a decent fellow.
I hate to die.
They learned to fight with left and right hands.
Then why are you smiling?
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
I am not left-handed.
And then they do it again when the other guy changes to his right hand.
I'm not left-handed either.
Johnny is about as good as you can get.
He can transform what he leams from someone like me into a character.
You know what you are doing, I'll give you that.
Excellent form, but how's your footwork?
Viggo came running in from Los Angeles and I stuck a sword in his hand and he had to fight
20 stuntmen in almost the same day as he arrived.
When all the stunties with their swords at the other end of the room and Viggo was standing there
like looking around like:
What next?
And then all of a sudden they just charged Viggo and they're like running towards him and he's just like... had his sword up.
Apparently, that was his initiation.
He didn't run away, so I think Bob was like:
Okay, I think I can work with this guy.
He had a lot to learn.
He did, I thought he did extremely well.
You know, it was hard work to prepare the fights and demanding physically at times.
But it was mostly fun and it was sort of like a boyhood dream come true.
You know, I got to really do it for real.
There were real enemies, it was a real sword.
It's important that the people you're working with trust you and you trust them and you effectively work out the sort of highly-detailed choreography weeks and weeks in advance of when you actually get to do it on the set.
And then really the tough thing becomes about stamina.
Especially when you are wearing armor and leather and weighed down by all that sort of stuff.
I thought it was some of the best choreography
I had seen in this type of movie.
A lot of the stuff the stunt men put together themselves.
And they did a very good job of it.
He is much more than a swordmaster, and I think that directors have been well pleased with his collaboration.
A sort of a regal refined cultured kind of a gentlemen in the midst of all this chaos.
It was an honor to work for him and I learned a lot.
Not just about sword fighting but just about being a man, about being a gentleman, about how to deal with people and a respect for the weapon.
and a respect for the weapon.
The swords were very well done, very attractive.
John Howe's designs were superb.
I really enjoyed getting involved with
"The Lord of the Rings" swords because it was always a question of paring it down and making the blades slimmer and making it shorter, making it more real, even though we are not talking about real swords.
The actor may tum up a year, a year and half after you first started designing that weapon.
It's therefore a great thing when you finally present the weapon to the actor.
I really enjoyed working with Richard Taylor and all the people at the Weta Workshop because they,
like Bob Anderson, were sticklers for detail.
The attention to detail that these guys devoted to items that may not necessarily be visible to the camera, at least not on first viewing, but they're there.
As an actor it was wonderful to have those kind of props to you know, really help transport you to that time and place.
I liken our effects workshop as are all other effects workshops around the world, to be similar to an artisan's studio of the years past.
This is a gathering of an eclectic group of craftspeople working across an amazing array of different artistic skills coming together.
It's a really exciting thing to be part of that.
As a designer you can draw your heart out.
You can draw hundreds, hundreds of designs that you love but if the man making them doesn't understand then there's, you know, it's-- everyone's disappointed.
We're incredibly fortunate to have a fellow named Peter Lyon, who was the metal worker, the swordsmith on the movie.
And he's someone who understands what weapons and armor are and he did these amazing blades.
The forging techniques I use are some ways they're similar and some ways they're different from the old techniques.
With sword blades I'll start with a bar of spring steel.
Usually, I'll cut and grind that and then if necessary, forge it.
We use bronze, wood, leather, and various other materials that were used in period.
The main difference really, is that today with mass production and steel foundries and so on, that we can get things to a much more consistent standard.
And essentially they're a lot easier to get and work with.
The style of the sword, the level of decoration, the aging on it, they all tell you a bit about whether this character is a new person, whether they're an old warrior.
It's a really lovely experience when the actors begin to take ownership of them.
Bob very much encouraged you to be familiar with this weapon, which in some cases is your livelihood.
Yes, it's only a movie, but, the more you can feel like it's not a movie, the better the movie.
Actors on the stage also demonstrate swordplay through real-time fight choreography.
[blades clashing]
[blades clashing]
[grunting]
Doing it on the stage is so very difficult.
They have to remember every blow.
On the films you can take a part of the fight, film it, do it once, twice, 15 times if necessary.
You get one chance on stage.
But you've got to be really good to be a good stage swordfighter.
When you've gone to the cut, and it comes in with a thrust, you tum, and your hand is stopped here and as you do it, you transfer that all in one fast move.
You try to hit him on the head with the cross part of your sword.
Now if he hangs on to his sword you pull him down and you hit him under the chin with the pommel.
But he knows that, what he does is he lets go.
Then I go to hit him, he has the advantage now and that's why you see them in the manuals.
The thing that we call a glissar, which means to glide, is which leads you straight at his belly.
In the 18th century the move still comes into swordplay.
We attack each other's chest, he comes back,
I stretch him on the lunge, and the glissar could disarm him.
So there is the same movement over a period of 200 years with different weapons it still has the same intention.
All those moves, you're trying to find out what the other one's doing.
Now you can do the glissar and then they all join together.
It's eye contact, it's distance, it's balance, it's timing and it's intent.
I was looking at Andy's eyes, I can see everything that his body's doing but I can also see Dad standing there and I can see 180 degrees in front of me.
Again the arm goes first, the reality obviously the arm plunge down or through the throat.
See, there won't be a second performance so we keep the arm, shoulder, the body looking as though it's going towards the throat but at the last moment we tum the point.
And to make it real, he then defends and tums away.
'Cause I don't trust him.
I feel that I might get hit so I then use the dagger to make sure that the sword has actually missed me.
You cut, and you hit him, and you take his intestines out.
You hope.
The reason I don't hit him is because as I cut him, my elbow is pulling the sword back into me.
The skill that that needs is just as great as the skill of killing him is, of course, sometimes the difference of about 2 inches.
[swords clashing]
The point of choreography in a play or a movie is to forward the story.
If it does that it is successful.
It's not designed to actually show a real fight, it's designed to show something exciting with swords.
There's an undeniable romanticism attached to it all.
And there's even the grittier films, I think, tend to steer clear of much of the mechanics of what a sword does to a human body.
And it has to look good on the screen.
I think, you know, I honestly believe that a real fight would be very short, sharp.
It's not just a piece of art, though it can be appreciated that way.
It's not just a piece of history because they were used for a purpose.
It is an ancient weapon that was used to gain or lose kingdoms.
There's always been fighting.
There's never been a time when there hasn't been personal combat.
People are interested in combat and cared about combat from the highest to the lowest in the land;
kings, and princes, emperors.
A sword as a weapon is something that pretty much everyone would have owned it in the Anglian Period, anyone being an adult male.
So, from top to bottom of society personal combat was important.
Few subjects have received such unfortunate neglect by historians than the martial arts of western Europe although ancient kings and nobles gave the blade great credence during their time, often modern academics fail to clearly write about the reality of the blade, defining its practice
as something apart from its actual use.
It's quite a popular subject, the history of dueling.
And you look at these books and one thing they never mentioned is the fighting.
You know, you'd think that this was the raison d'etre of a duel.
But the one thing they never mentioned was techniques of combat.
It's a subject that has been ignored for the most part for centuries.
Probably the world's foremost scholar on historical fencing,
Dr. Sidney Anglo, broke open the subject.
He said, "Hey historians, you've missed the boat."
I'm sure that a lot of historians still find it kind of not a proper subject.
That it isn't something that historians should be writing about.
Which, of course is foolish.
Think it's perhaps not a very nice thing, you know, these people cutting each other to pieces and running each other through and so forth, and often killing each other, and if they didn't kill each other they often maimed each other.
Originally fencing meant simply the art of defense;
the noble science of defense.
We have lots of records of there being fencing schools all over the place and we also have records of people complaining about fencing schools and the noise and the violence that they engendered.
This changed bit by bit into the late 16th and 17th century when they became more fashionable for nobles to go to these schools and to learn how to fence.
Yet today, there are too few historians that fully understand
Yet today, there are too few historians that fully understand the significant role of medieval masters.
And so to a large extent much of their history is lost to us.
The sobering death toll of the First World War spoke plainly the truth that the romance of war was officially lost in time.
The one-on-one dueling spirit of the sword could not prevail under the shadow of automatic machine gunfire with its gruesome wake of millions who were all too soon forgotten.
With the increased use of firearms during the tum of the century the slow erasure of classical sword fighting from public consciousness seemed almost inevitable.
Fortunately the romance of swordplay remained in the hearts of early filmmakers who kept it alive through imagination and fantasy.
But would the lost art of sword defense every truly be reborn?
It was a change from battlefield techniques and fighting skills for judicial combat and for private duel and for street level self-defense to essentially gentlemen having private affairs of honor, identical swords;
single sword against single sword.
Most duels back in the day were not to the death;
Most duels back in the day were not to the death;
they were just to first blood.
During the 1700s you had guns beginning to supplant the sword as the choice weapon for dueling and in the mid-1800s fencing became more and more a sport.
People started, you know, playing the game instead of training to actually duel.
The term fencing today is primarily synonymous with the collegiate and Olympic sport of epee, foil, and saber.
Now it's based on hooking yourself up into an electric circuit and depressing tips.
You can just slip it in anywhere, as long as you slip it in on target, then it's a good touch for you.
Fencing became more and more a sport and there's a lot of aspects of fencing that are fun.
Anybody who wants to leam how to use a sword should go into fencing because it teaches you the handling of the weapon.
I like the honor aspect and the dueling history that goes along with it.
Modern fencing has retained a lot of the values of Renaissance fencing in the way we always salute before and after our bouts.
The thing that I like about fencing is that it allows me to do a physical but also a mental sport.
It's much more a thinking game than it is a physical game despite the fact that it's a tremendously athletic endeavor.
Tips of fencing blades go as fast as 135 miles an hour.
Fencers have very quick reflexes, a lot of leg strength.
You have to deal with someone attacking you before you can go.
And fencing is straight forward and back.
They're used to people reacting to their moves in a particular sort of ways.
There's a whole language of this very highly refined sport.
It's not real, though.
And it's been 200 or 300 years of evolution away from people nicking one another or cutting one another or killing one another with swords.
There are very specific penalties for brutality and hitting a little bit too hard and if the referee in control of the bout, if they thought it was with malicious intent or too hard or anything like that you can get penalized,
docked points, thrown out of the toumament.
You will see coupEs, flicks, where the electric connection on the end will score but if you had a point you're making a little bitty nick where as the classical fencer will stick you.
I can get my rapier and leverage him there and come in here and put it into him.
I was sparring with some friends who were fencers and as he lunged I slapped the blade aside with my left hand and extended my right and stabbed him.
And he said, "You can't do that."
And I said, "But I just did."
I can engage it and take it out this way.
Then he said, "But that's illegal."
And I said, "I'm not interested in legalities,
I'm trying to kill you."
They have no problem grabbing you by the waist and knocking you to the ground and beating you over the head with their sword.
He does a lunge at me, I would kick that leg out from him and I'm gonna half sword my rapier.
This wouldn't occur to a fencer.
Fencing masters, my fencing coaches would say,
"Well yeah, you can't do that;
"You can't grab his leg, you can't kick him, you can't trip him, you can't push him."
People weren't dumb in the 1100s.
They had their own styles or whatever but they were much more all encompassing in terms of combat than this kind of fencing is.
We don't think of this as fighting.
There's a lot of aspects of fencing that are fun, but you can't take their rules and things too seriously because they just don't work in a straight fight.
The evolution of fencing is rather simple.
Historical swordplay transitioned to classical fencing upon the advent of the gun.
Over the past century, sport, or Olympic fencing was developed from classical fencing.
Modern sport fencing is not necessarily an advancement of historical European martial arts but rather a pruning down from older more inclusive fighting systems.
In time, proper decorum and stylized posture came to replace combat utility.
By the 19th century, fighting men no longer needed to learn and use diverse arms and armor and had fewer occasions to employ such skills.
Not surprisingly, what was not modified and adapted from the wider craft consequently withered and died.
As they pursued a far more specialized form of gentlemanly fencing, directed towards duels of honor with single identical swords, they came to dismiss and sometimes even ridicule older fencing skills.
At the same time, fencing became more sport-focused and in the 19th century it increasingly lost its military or self-defense value.
Those who continued to duel did so under less and less lethal terms.
The popular myth of crude and clumsy medieval swords slowly evolving into more superior thrusting swords began to surface at this time.
Ancient European martial arts were now officially lost in time.

If you look at our society there are a large number of subcultures from reenactment, from Revolutionary War to even reenactment of World War ll.
It's interesting in that it puts the human being back in to where he should be;
into the middle of it.
It's an interesting way to study history and it's a lot more fun than sitting there with a book.
This is an epee blade.
This is what we originally started using for fencing in the SCA.
It's the same type of blade that's used in strip fencing that you would see at the colleges.
The strip fencing is more of a sport.
It's not really dedicated to the medieval martial arts of the sword.
What I have here looks more like a real sword.
It's heavier but it is still designed to be safe, to bend without breaking.
It has more of the weight of a real medieval sword, so we can start to use the techniques as they would have been used in the Middle Ages with a proper weighted weapon.
Well, it's a wide spectrum of things;
it goes from people dressed as Orchs to very serious people who weave their own cloth.
There is an individual fulfillment that the individual becomes somebody more than just a small cog in a large plastic machine.
Historical reenactment folks have got their own culture and it's an amazing thing.
It's a great to be in but it's a whole gestalt for them.
It's a whole lifestyle for them.
What we do is to create a persona, each of us who joins.
My name is Greg Prevost in the real world.
In the SCA, I'm known as Janos of Kitmendown, which is Welsh and it's hard to spell.
You create the clothing, the equipment for that person and you become that person at the events.
I take the name Achbar lvanalli.
That name actually derives from Andalusian Spain so it's Moorish.
And my title in the SCA is King currently.
But I'm also a knight in the SCA.
Once you get knighted you are knighted for life so it's like a lifetime achievement award.
This is a very family-oriented society.
Everyone's welcome.
I have four children and all of them have been to their first event when they were weeks or months old.
My oldest son is 11 now and I'm starting to teach him how to fence.
We don't chop each other in this sport.
There's a thrust and there's a draw cut.
Every kingdom is ruled by a king and queen.
They are chosen by combat.
When all the fighters come forward and they have a best two-out-of-three elimination tournament.
You call the wound as accurately as you can what it would have done to you if it had been a real sword.
For instance, ifyou get hit a legal blow to your leg, you then have to drop your knees and fight from the ground which compromises your mobility quite a bit.
Your opponent has the option of being chivalrous and also taking the same handicap so that the match continues to be equal but he doesn't have to.
It's on his honor.
If he does agree, takes up that handicap, then he is lauded by the audience for his chivalry.
If I get hit with a solid blow that would have been killing with a real sword, I will act out that death.
We don't say that we are dead, we say we are disinclined to continue.
People see us fight from a distance at first they think of Medieval Times, strictly for the entertainment of people watching.
The SCA's completely different.
It's an actual sport.
We're competing.
Every blow thrown out there is thrown with real force.
We don't know who, when we step on the field, will win and we don't know who will be the next king until the last blow is thrown in the tournament.
It's just a different spin off of the same basic history.
The creative part is we take the best parts of the Middle Ages and we try to recreate them;
the beauty, the pageantry.
We leave behind the plague and the death.
I think that reenactment is an interesting and valid,
I feel like, approach to-- approach to history, it can be a very rich, rich, rich source of information.
It's also a little bit dangerous, because reenactment is now becoming a part of history itself which troubles me quite a bit.
When you take a pipe and you wrap it with some padding and you whack on one another that's no different from reality than we who fence with electronic gear that lets us know whether or not a touch would have happened.
If the swords were actually sharp, most of these guys really wouldn't be doing this.
And I wouldn't be either.
There are many martial arts within the Asian culture.
Out of China you have manta style, tiger style, eagle style, wing tsun.
From Korea, you have taekwondo, kongsoodo, soobahkdo, kwonbup, taekyun, hapkido, yudo, gumdo, gumsool.
Out of Japan you have the very familiar karate, judo, kendo.
Out of the Philippines you have escrima or amis.
Out of Thailand you have muy thai.
Out of Burma you have bando and I'm sure there are many, many others.
When you hit a target area, you have to say where you're hitting;
so, "head," "wrist," "side."
Hua-mo-ah!
Just coming in and hitting is not considered a point.
I have to have proper etiquette.
I have to make a pronounced step.
I have to hit the proper part of my sword which is in between this leather piece and this leather piece.
Ah-oo!
I have to either go forward or backward.
Hua!
My body, my mind, and my sword have to be all in unison.
The idea is you're becoming one with your weapon.
In the '70s and the '80s, movies increased our interest in Asian martial arts.
Hey, wouldn't a fly-swatter be easier.
Man who catch fly with chopstick, accomplish anything.
Today when people hear the term martial arts they immediately bring to mind fighting arts from the East such as karate and taekwondo.
There's a more esoteric concept to kill someone efficiently that is more than just killing someone and that, in my opinion, is absent within the Westem swording styles as opposed to Eastem.
In many respects you can say the West had the same attitude that the Japanese had but we handled it differently.
So there's nothing really different in these things.
We have a tendency to forget that the West had their own tradition of martial arts as well.
European fighting skills tend to sort of get relegated to something that was very sort of crude and basic, which it wasn't.
What's funny is they don't seem to remember that the human body's the same the world over.
And it depends on how your body moves and that's govemed by body mechanics.
It's somewhat amusing to have a dEbute of the oriental martial arts glancing through a European manual on, say wrestling, or hand-to-hand combat and say,
"Oh wow, this is done almost like the Japanese."
Things from Asia and Japan are viewed as being sort of pinnacle of fighting skills and as skillful as they were, we were just as skillful here.
But what we did was we forgot about them.
As you're comparing the two, look how quickly the West seized on the firearm and made great use of it.
Whereas in Japan it was used for a brief period of time until once the Tokugawa Shogunate was established, they were banned because this would destroy the social culture.
When a peasant could blast a samurai from 50 yards away, it was unthinkable.
Martial arts from the East of very hierarchical being orally transmitted from one person to the next.
Pretty much, it was a heredity thing because you had to be born a samurai.
So it was essentially father to son, master to disciple.
When of course the big difference is the schools and some of the oriental schools continued to flourish.
How far they're teaching exactly the same sorts of things they taught in the past, is only anybody's guess.
You remember the game where you whisper and then you whisper to the next, by the time it gets to the end this thought is all different.
Eastem martial arts have a long and continuous history where in the West martial arts, with the sword in particular, died down a lot after the Renaissance.
As the gun improved the sword was relegated and became less and less important.
People stopped training and teaching in the old arts.
There was no necessity, no need to learn those things anymore.
So we have essentially a break in the history of the sword in the Western world.
What was the sword, and how was it used?
Before practical swordplay developed into a gentlemen's ritual of single dueling, masters of defense flourished across Europe.
Many of the surviving manuscripts detailing their combative systems remained largely obscure for centuries, until now.
Today historical fencing studies are on the rise and an unprecedented revival of these extinct combative systems is now underway.
[music]
The West had its own martial arts tradition exactly as the Orient did, exactly the same.
There's been a renaissance, so to speak, in the study of the sword offering us a lot of insight that had been lost in the several hundred years since the sword was truly relevant to combat.
The work of people in making very accurate recreations of the sword in terms of form as well as the manner in which they would handle, and then those martial artists who are taking these accurate recreations, moving them in space, and working out
what was possible and what isn't possible.
All across Europe, the Americas and around the world historical European fight clubs have emerged with the desire to study the original combative systems of both Europe and the ancient world.
They have set out to practice with a different kind of energy and intensity separate from the reenactment and sport fencing groups.
We're trying to discover something that's always been there and has been forgotten and it's a lot of work to obviously, to try to understand what was lost.
It's a part of our history in Europe and I think that's very important.
This is actually our history.
This is actually how we fought.
Historical European martial arts is the study of Europe's traditional fighting systems.
I'm doing this because I had previously studied
Asian martial arts and I wanted to study martial arts related to my own culture and the place that I'm from.
Martial arts from Japan or China or southeastAsia, as valid as they are, I wanted something that was from my culture and for me.
I came from a long background of doing martial arts so I wanted to see how modem arts compared to the old arts and it seems that their standard was every bit as complicated as ours, and possibly more so.
If you look at modern sport fencing and kendo, and the like, they've actually become simplified versions of these great complex systems, which are actually brutal.
It's our past, it's part of our culture actually.
Today historical European martial arts groups are reclaiming the ancient fighting techniques and studying the diversity of arms and armor.
For me I think the sword is like what it was in the medieval time.
What matters is the man on the other side.
The difference between the medieval sword and the Japanese sword is that the Japanese put their soul into the sword.
In medieval time, what matters was to put the other man into the sword.
There's no such thing as just a sword.
It's a weapon for killing people and I'm learning how to do it efficiently.
To me the sword is... cool.
For centuries these ancient fighting skills
For centuries these ancient fighting skills have not been practiced.
Historical fencing students are now leaming to reconstruct martial arts that have been until now, extinct.
We're having to try and rediscover what the fight masters of the time were thinking and how they formulated their techniques and how they evolved.
So there's quite a strong academic side to it in the westem martial arts.
We're essentially resurrecting this from books.
Just as European scholars wrote down every other art and science, the science of defense was also documented and recorded.
Many of the old fighting manuals and treaties that were written during the 15th and 16th centuries have recently been rediscovered and are now being studied worldwide.
We focus on mainly German manuals but also ltalian manuals, 15th century and 16th century.
My personal favorite is Talhoffer.
For the most part the Italian books, the German books and the Spanish books on the fighting arts have been forgotten, hidden in old libraries and monasteries in old archives and universities.
Unfortunately, very little research had been done on them.
For the most part, they had not been looked at for hundreds of years.
Today these old texts are once again being systematically studied and the ancient fighting skills are being reborn.
In the text the old masters actually request that the students study the source literature and in one instance they ask that they add to the text, bringing their own ideas to it and expanding upon it.
These arts existed in various forms because they evolved together hand in hand with the societies that created them.
There's nothing equivalent to that in any of the other world's traditional martial arts.
They don't have the volumes of technical literature that we have.
This is our westem tradition.
A lot of people leam martial arts from people who learned it from somebody else so often times it's many generations removed from someone with real combat experience.
These books, they're written by the source.
There's a play in Wallerstein, specifically, where the caption says something like:
The swordsmen have captured each others' swords.
I thought how that would never happen in a fight and I that following week I was in a bind with a guy who spun out and we were standing just like the play showed, and so that, all of a sudden,
becomes like a direct link back to that time.
How did they communicate their systems to absent third party?
This is combination of words and images where you have a kind of notation where you can almost read the movements
like we'd read in music.
It combines a ground plan, where your feet go, a representation of how you hold the weapon.
You can see the relationship between the swords, horizontally as well as vertically because it casts a shadow and, of course, scores of postures, the overall attempt to convey what the author wants his student to understand.
This is the source literature.
This is what's going to tell us how they did it back then and this is how we should be doing it again today.
When one looks at books on arms and armor, the incredible detail and diversity of design in such weaponry is apparent.
Therefore, it stands to reason that there should be an equally sophisticated manner of using such weapons.
I was inspired by the works of a gentleman named
Ewart Oakeshott.
Oakeshott was considered the world's leading authority on European swords, on medieval swords in particular.
Most academics look on them as quaint curiosities, but they have no real concept of what that sword was used for or even how it was used.
Ewart made it into what it was.
These were weapons made for young men to kill other young men;
a real weapon used by real people.
The typology of the sword that Ewart Oakeshott devised included a classification for all historical blades.
Oakshott's classifications unlocked the mythical doors that had obscured the true history of European martial combat.
I think if you look at any Anglo Saxon blades, for example, or Viking blades, ordinary warriors might have a long knife and a spear and a shield, but they don't have the sword.
There are very few swords in comparison to the number of axes or spears.
Spearheads and axes a blacksmith can make.
You have to be a swordsmith to get the technology to be able to make a sword.
I feel a real connection to the ancient smiths because I like doing it with the tools that they had, with the fuel that they had, with just clay and water and a hand hammer and charcoal.
I have a modern shop, too.
I've got air hammers and gas forgers and electric kilns which I used for experimentation and making sure that what I think is happening the ancient way is actually happening with some modern tests.
What really affects me is the chemistry.
Say, "Well how do they make stuff from iron sand, from dirt, basically?"
It's kind of magic.
The more I learned about it the more I realized there's different ways that different cultures did it so I had to try that.
I don't like just reading about it and putting a book on the shelf.
I want to do it until I get it right which causes a whole lot of sleepless nights and a lot of work and a lot of trial and error.
I feel that a collector like myself does at least have some utility to those attempting to rediscover the sword.
I can provide a swordsmith such as Paul the opportunity to make very careful measurements so that some of the original swords which have survived-- rediscovering the way in which they were put together to give great performance even with materials and techniques
that are primitive by today's technological standards.
Well, sometimes there is a debate going:
Is the Japanese sword better?
Or the Chinese sword?
Or the Chinese taught the Japanese their techniques, so basically it's just a refined Chinese sword.
Well, no the European swords are better-- no whoots, lndian-type blades are better.
I've been working a lot of these traditions and I'm finding more similarities of how they solved their problems than I am finding differences.
But they have different ways of doing them, different ways to stack them.
Some of them using twists some of them didn't use twisted steel.
But they solved the problems in a very similar fashion.
And that really intrigued me.
I figured out some things that were wrong in books, things that weren't written in books, and other things that I feel are right by actually doing them and trying them and testing the swords and breaking swords,
analyzing things.
I enjoyed getting primary knowledge.
Definitely people who smelt their own steel and test their own blades and make all things--
Where I feel the connection is sitting back there with the fire going and pumping the bellows with everything quiet and just me and forging that blade.
In 2006 a suitcase in the attic of a well-loved and deceased archaeologist was literally saved from history's dust bin.
The treasure inside:
a sword, 13 centuries old.
Since then the sword has been tested extensively by the Royal Armories and the Bamburgh Research Project in a effort to unlock the secrets of this rare object's hidden past.
This is one of the most significant swords found by Brian Hope-Taylor in his 1960s excavation.
It remained in his possession up until his death in 2001 at which point it came back to the castle.
When you hold it today it has an almost mystical quality to it.
It looks like a corroded lump of metal but in its glory this would have been an awe inspiring sight.
The x-rays revealed it to be an extraordinarily sophisticated piece of technology.
It proved to be an incredibly important weapon.
One of the most important weapons,
I think it's fair to say, ever found in Britain.
It's actually composed at its central core of six strands of iron which are worked and twisted and welded together.
On the edge of that is added a steel seventh element, if you like, in a technique called Patton welding.
An iron core with a forge-welded steel edge, so you get the flex and strength of the iron with the extreme cutting power of the steel.
Which is incredibly tough and quite springy and flexible, so it won't break very easily.
You'd rather have a sword softer, take a set, take a bend, than break.
Because a broken sword in your hand during a battle, you're done.
I wouldn't want to be the smith that the customer came back to with his brother's broken sword in his hand going,
"Hey, why did you make this so brittle?"
If a warrior would go into battle with a sword that was excessively hard and brittle the battle for him could be very short indeed.
There's only a handful like this in the world, probably four or five in the entire world.
Experts we've talked to in the British Museum of the Royal Armories don't know of a single example of a six stranded sword prior to this one being identified which does suggest that they are- something of this
technological sophistication is staggeringly rare.
If you were actually have looked in the home of a medieval warrior or a warrior in another culture of a century or 2 ago, often the sword would've really, you know, represented the most technologically advanced item in the house.
It represents the epitome of technology of weapons technology of its age.
It is, I suppose in a modern analogy, something like a stealth fighter.
The one thing I can say with certainty is that it's very, very difficult to make one of these.
You wouldn't let a smith who knew the secrets of making a sword like this wander about.
They would have been kept closely guarded by the king.
The information would have been an incredibly jealously guarded secret.
The process is very long and very arduous and requires an incredible level of skill.
He would have had a mastery of metals.
He would have known exactly when to take it from the fire, which bits to forge, how hard to hit it, when to hit it, more importantly when not to hit it.
One single blow can shatter a blade like this easily if it's at the wrong temperature.
Literally tens of thousands of hammer blows have to be right.
When you manufacture a blade like this you don't just make it, you live it, and you dream about it and you think about it every single moment.
It would often reflect the very best craftsmanship and some of the best applied art of that culture.
I generally try to see how all the pieces were put together because Patton welding is quite a complicated process.
That would have been translated into a 3-D reconstruction in the computer of how it was put together.
There is a cleanliness of line and an economy of weight to make it efficient, durable, as light as possible.
I'm continually impressed to no end of how beautiful all these objects are.
High-end warriors and kings who can do what they want with precious metals and precious stones.
The idea that they don't need to because the sword itself is so precious, I think, speaks volumes.
There must have been quite a lot of thought on the part of the regular soldier to actually preserve the blade from damage.
Simply to employ a person of the caliber of the individual who made this would have cost a fortune, would have cost an absolute fortune.
If you look at old swords you can tell which ones have had to be used to parry or bone break.
You can tell bone breaks, too.
It's actually notched and chipped along both sides which does suggest that it has been used repeatedly in battle.
A sword of this quality would have been owned by someone who was incredibly important.
It was probably owned by one of the kings of Northumbria, possibly by several of them which does suggest
200 or 300 years of use.
So it may of well been an heirloom of the Northumbrian Royal House, passed down from generations basically from one king to another.
A sword like this, I think, would have inspired absolute terror.
When you're in battle and you see a sword of this quality coming towards you, you would know immediately that the person who wielded a sword like this was someone who had spent their entire life training to be a warrior,
who lived their life by the sword.
[music]
Contrary to popular notions, the medieval long sword
Contrary to popular notions, the medieval long sword is surprisingly light, weighing an average of only 3 pounds and capable of blindingly fast attacks.
Sword combatants use both footwork and the ability to manipulate timing and distance to enhance the swords cutting and thrusting capabilities.
One of the primary principles of swordplay is to attack and defend at the same time where every attack contains and defense and every defense contains a counter attack.
Picking up a sharp implement and cutting someone, you know you can teach that very quickly, however the strategy behind it--when to attack, when not attack--that is a very mental pursuit.
The subtle movements, the deceptions, the trickery, where I look over here, move and strike someplace else.
When you start fencing with medieval swords, then you discover that there is more to it than actually using just the blade.
There's different angles and lots of things that it's not obvious for the normal person in using the sword.
Levering with the sword to try to disarm the other guy, bashing with the cross, pommel.
Historically European martial artists believe that it is important to study and practice the techniques with great energy and intensity.
From the manuals we can see the diversity of the ancient masters' skills.
They studied two weapon combinations:
sword with shields, swords with buckler, and swords with daggers.
Often they considered unarmored and well as armored fighting, mounted as well as on foot.
Generally the ancient masters always integrated armed and unarmed skills, never practicing fencing without also including grappling and wrestling techniques.
Most of these combats probably ended on the ground.
When he's down on the ground and I'm using all my weight to shove my sword through him, then I can penetrate.
In order to comprehend the sword, you need to comprehend all the techniques surrounding the actual use of swords.
Contrary to what you see at Ren fairs and what you see in Hollywood movies, armored fighting is not about using the edge of the sword.
It's not gonna penetrate that breast plate or that plate leg armor so they have to come up with another way of defeating a man in armor and that method is primarily half swording.
The manuals are full of this technique.
I grab my own blade and I use it as a thrusting weapon.
I can shorten the blade by doing this and make it much stiffer so I have accuracy and enough strike to penetrate his armor.
I have to thrust it in, and put some weight behind it and really drive it.
Fencing does not allow you to use the left hand and I have heard people tell you or say that the left hand is for balance.
It has nothing to do with balance.
We're constantly using this hand, so if he makes an attack- if I have to I'll use elbow, forearm, anything I need to.
Now in classical fencing or dueling manuals you see slapping the blade as a constant thing.
In fact, you will see that most of the time with the left hand up here in a position to slap.
He makes a thrust and I have to get to here,
I'm gonna disarm him.
You have to do freeplay, you have to do an intense amount of mock combat.
You have to do it with as realistic a way as possible.
[music]
Today we do a lot of sitting.
You know we sit in front of our computers.
We sit in front of our televisions.
We sit on the way to work, then we get to work and we sit.
Then we go home and we sit again and then we're laying down.
In the medieval renaissance eras people didn't.
They did a lot of walking and a lot of riding and a lot of running.
I think we have no idea how much like rawhide these people must have been back in, you know, 5 or 6 centuries ago.
I think we're very soft nowadays despite our efforts to remain, you know, fit.
[music]
I was a sword nut at 12, so me and one of my friends went out.
I was a sword nut at 12, so me and one of my friends went out.
We immediately went "bang, bang, bang,"
started fencing with them.
And after it was over with, I had two hacksaws because you know it just ruins the edge.
Well I was shocked and upset because this wasn't what happened in the movies.
Movie combat is really a curious undertaking because it's not very realistic, generally.
It doesn't portray how the historical weaponry actually performs and handles.
It's one of my favorite themes actually that that metallic noise that a sword makes coming out of a scabbard which makes no sense.
Swords don't make a noise when they come out, you know.
It's, life as a fantasy.
It doesn't reflect the way human beings actually behave in violent, personal armed combat.
Mainly when you see movies nowadays, they always focus on techniques even in moves displaying medieval Europe.
They always focus on Asian techniques and et cetera, and that's not our way, so to speak.
Westem martial arts, you know, that's, you know, whether it be English, Italian, French, Spanish, there are specifics to those styles and those weapons that are ignored in most of the movies these days.
It's like a huge pot of soup with many, many ingredients.
You know they're hybrids, really.
They're not true to westem martial arts, I wouldn't say, for the most part because they're mixing in elements of Asian martial arts that have no place there, really if you want to be realistic.
So you have a little bit kung fu, and a little bit of, you know, a little bit of everything.
Most of the time a lot of these movies are very good.
The problem that I have with it is that a lot of people in the audience think this is the way you use a sword.
It's purely for entertainment;
this is true.
But it certainly makes my job harder.
We teach people:
No, your sword's not going to cut through a guy with plate armor;
no you can't cut through-- cut a Z in somebody's chest.
But you can do other things and they're even more interesting because they're real.
Many who study classical fencing and European martial arts believe that if you give the audience more realism combined with credible performances then they will enjoy and embrace it.
I think that now there's a generation of moviegoers and readers who are ready for that, and they're asking for that.
Classical fences and historical European martial artists and scholars have now shown that there is a wonderful craft out there that has been lost but that can now be made to exist again.
There have, recently there are some movies that have been focusing a little bit on European martial arts.
Good examples of films that feature combat based on specific historical swordsmanship include "Rob Roy," "Gladiator,"
"Troy," "Kingdom of Heaven" and "Alatriste."
In some few cases people are more in tune and do a better job of researching and being true to the style of the period.
As I said, Bob does this very well.
For example, in "Alatriste,"
they're not what Bob would call sword-slapping scenes, you know.
His goal is always credibility, naturalism, fights the way they would be and the reason that people are careful going in and they're, once they commit they commit fully is because even a small wound in those times-
infection and you could die just from that.
You're going in to kill and it's over with very quickly.
They were violent, you know, shockingly violent at times and there were very real, dangerous consequences to mixing it up with swords.
In many regards it is to the high fantasy of film that we are indebted for today's resurgence of western martial arts.
Movies have inspired many talented individuals to take up the sword in an effort to rediscover its true martial significance.
The resurgence of authentic European martial arts has been growing exponentially over time.
Over the years it has actually become influential in cinema.
Historical European martial arts are neither reenactment nor sport fencing.
They're in a category all of their own.
This fresh approach to training takes history into account striving to improve both its practice and authenticity.
Our lives don't depend on this craft.
Our lives don't depend on this craft.
Nobody's going to challenge us to a duel at the mall with a rapier.
Nobody's going to ambush us in the parking lot with a bastard sword, so we have to have altemative reasons for why we're doing this.
We do this, I think, because it needs to be done.
And hopefully it will increase everyone's understanding and awareness of how European warfare was conducted.
They will be appreciated for as effective and as elegant and as useful as anything the rest of the world has to offer.
All these things that have been forgotten needs to be found again.
In an age where truth seems so far from us, symbol of the sword shines bright.
The journey it takes to become good with your blade, to become good with your sword, that takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, and that changes a person, matures a person.
Obviously in the process it is going to teach you to become a better man.
We hope to be--who knows-- someday a better swordsman, maybe even mildly average swordsman.
It would be more than I would ever expect.
What story can an ancient sword tell us?
I can't say I really understand the sword as of yet, but hopefully one day I will be there.
Eventually, I would like my studies to take me to the great heights of beating my instructor- the first woman to ever do so.
Sword fighting is kind of different and looked like good fun and I've been a couple of times and it is good fun.
While those who train today have only begun to scratch the surface, they are slowly beginning to lift the shadow.
You know, it's all those dreams that you really can't have any more 'cause you've grown up.
People are often looking backwards in time to see whereabouts we've come from.
Even in the '50s, progress was happening.
People were looking forward and now we've reached a point,
I think, where we're looking all around, trying to find meaning to what's happening.
People need to feel that sense of identity with their past and their history.
There's nothing richer than history.
History is, you know, history is, all of us over thousands of years.
I've been doing martial arts for over 20 years now.
I've noticed my body changing and I'm getting older and things are a little bit more difficult.
However, I don't give up on that.
I train myself harder so it becomes very, very mental.
Your body goes away, but your mind should stay sharp.
So I get a bit more gray and a little more stooped.
As long as I can swing a hammer,
I'm just going to keep doing this.
Within the sword lies the power both to protect and to rule.
It can be used for great evil or for great good;
to control a people or stop the hordes of a tyrant;
to break the rightful will of a nation or to set the truth free and every man a king over his own fate.
A good swordsman does not take lightly unsheathing his sword.
If your sword is out, it means that you intend to use it.
It's a pity, really, that we couldn't fight with rapiers today rather than guns.
It's a pity that gunpowder was invented, in my mind, because we would probably still be fighting with rapiers.
And I'd be good at it.

When men were to take up arms, the predominant object was the sword.
'Cause when I have done sword fights in movies,
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT:
What are they for?
Often these things were right at the point of history.
They're such a part of our cultural heritage.
[HAMMER STRIKING]
[MUSIC]
The Medieval and Renaissance blade, a profound and beautiful object handcrafted by master artisans of old.
It is designed to kill.
The truth of the sword has been shrouded in antiquity and the Renaissance martial arts that brought it into being are long forgotten.
The ancient practitioners lent us all that they knew through their manuscripts.
As gunslingers of the Renaissance they were the western heroes with swords.
They lived and died by them.
Yet today, their history remains cloaked under a shadow of legend.
Before the invention of gunpowder, the sword was the weapon of the time.
The sword probably has not been a relevant weapon for at least 200 years.
To think that a pummel, a handgrip, a crossbar, a blade, a very simple object could hold such sway over thousands of years of human evolution.
These objects have really controlled our history and where we are today.
Swords have been used throughout history to defend people and land, to build nations and to protect kingdoms from tyranny.
From 1st century wars against Rome to the Viking and Norman conquests, sword and steel have changed the fate of kingdoms, the map of Europe and ultimately the timeline of world history.
Their essential role in preserving freedom and honor goes back far into the dim mists of history.
The connection between sword and freedom may perhaps find its origin within the customs of the Germanic and Celtic tribes.
Here, being armed with a sword was not only a fight but also a duty of all free men.
In fact, the ceremony for giving freedom to a slave required that the form er slave be presented with the armament of a free man.
Many British kings chose to trust their subjects with arms and to supplement the militia in times of need rather than abolish it.
The idea of a free militia versus a financed army presents an interesting concept that is reflected in many of our modern films.
The sword is as relevant today as a symbol as it was in ages past, being found within statues, civic emblems, and insignia both ancient and modern.
It has been an ancient symbol for words spoken in truth, for purity, justice and the spirit of God.
The iconic power of the sword is everywhere within our culture from literature to popular entertainment and nowhere is it more celebrated than in the modern cinema.
There's a definite symbolism that's part and parcel of every story containing a sword.
The sword combines power, authority, and the threat of impending violence all in a prop, which might be hanging off somebody's side until the moment they draw it.
I think there's something more intimate about two guys going at it with swords.
To fight someone with a sword as opposed to shooting someone with a gun, I think it takes more courage.
It's conflict at its most raw where you've got two characters looking at each other eye to eye engaging at that level.
And the stakes are higher it could go either way.
You are right there in the end and the sword, in many ways, is an extension of that character's arm so it's really a sharpened fist.
It suddenly is a realm of myth, of legend, of heroes, of adventures.
That would explain to a large degree the popularity of swords.
They're, you know, an integral part of it.
Our technology has progressed far beyond needing the sword as an object of personal defense, and while it's still irrelevant, don't you think it's interesting the extent to which we seem to still have the image of the sword, the concept of the sword,
the symbolic importance of the sword.
I mean, it's hard to turn on the television or go to the cinema, it seems, without still being surrounded by swords.
[MUSIC]
Our stories and movies contain the kind of morality and justice that we only wish we could find in the real world.
I've had the honor really-- I have to say it like that--
I've had the honor really-- I have to say it like that--
Of working with Bob Anderson as my swordmaster.
In all of the fights that I did on film as a coach, and indeed as a modern fencer, has undoubtedly been my life, swordplay.
Others who have worked with him feel like I do, that you always want to give 100% to live up to the choreography that he comes up with.
Even his presence, just him walking on the set, suddenly you have to pick up your game a bit, you know.
The first time I met Bob Anderson was actually on the set of "Lord of the Rings."
He turns around and introduces himself and says,
"Well, I'm going to show you a few things that might save your life today, mate."
And so he proceeded to show me some basic blocking and thrusting and cutting moves with the sword.
And the guy who came after him to show me some more says,
"Oh, do you realize who that was?"
And I was like, "No, I don't."
"Well, that's Bob Anderson.
"He, you know, he used to train Errol Flynn and you know, has worked for years in the industry."
And I said, "Oh really, is that so?"
Why don't you give up?
You can see I'm a better swordsman
Errol Flynn was a very talented, athletic actor who could do anything if he set his mind to it.
And that's why he became a swordsman, I think, is because the parts that were getting the publicity in those days-- Sword fighting and stuff--
Fighting at the end, and you know,
Douglas Fairbanks stuff as it was called in those days.
Then he said, "Oh, and he was Darth Vader."
He was actually in Darth Vader's costume actually doing all the light saber work.
And I was like... that sort of struck a resonance with me, you know.
Oh, Darth Vader, yes.
It's just a cloak and a helmet that I was underneath it all.
I did choreograph the fights.
I did three of those.
It was good work for me.
It became the weapon of choice in that series of films.
Indeed even, it seems when somebody's making a science-fiction movie and off in space they can't seem to escape from the sword.
I wonder why that is'?
What is it?
It's your father's light saber.
This is a weapon of a Jedi knight.
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.
An elegant weapon for a more civilized age.
To go into the future and then think about laser swords, that's brilliant.
Suddenly "Star Wars" is not just a sci-fi movie, it's also a modern version of a hero legend.
"The Princess Bride" was one of the best fights and everybody tells me it was one of the best fights
I've choreographed.
You seem like a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.
You seem like a decent fellow.
I hate to die.
They learned to fight with left and right hands.
Then why are you smiling?
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
I am not left-handed.
And then they do it again when the other guy changes to his right hand.
I'm not left-handed either.
Johnny is about as good as you can get.
He can transform what he learns from someone like me into a character.
You know what you are doing, I'll give you that.
Excellent form, but how's your footwork?
Viggo came running in from Los Angeles and I stuck a sword in his hand and he had to fight
20 stuntmen in almost the same day as he arrived.
When all the stunties with their swords at the other end of the room and Viggo was standing there like looking around LIKE:
What next?
And then all of a sudden they just charged Viggo and they're like running towards him and he's just like... had his sword up.
Apparently, that was his initiation.
He didn't run away, so I think Bob was like:
Okay, I think I can work with this guy.
He had a lot to learn.
He did, I thought he did extremely well.
You know, it was hard work to prepare the fights and demanding physically at times.
But it was mostly fun and it was sort of like a boyhood dream come true.
You know, I got to really do it for real.
There were real enemies, it was a real sword.
It's important that the people you're working with trust you and you trust them and you effectively work out the sort of highly-detailed choreography weeks and weeks in advance of when you actually get to do it on the set.
And then really the tough thing becomes about stamina.
Especially when you are wearing armor and leather and weighed down by all that sort of stuff.
I thought it was some of the best choreography
I had seen in this type of movie.
A lot of the stuff the stunt men put together themselves.
And they did a very good job of it.
He is much more than a swordmaster, and I think that directors have been well pleased with his collaboration.
A son of a regal refined cultured kind of a gentlemen in the midst of all this chaos.
It was an honor to work for him and I learned a lot.
Not just about sword fighting but just about being a man, about being a gentleman, about how to deal with people and a respect for the weapon.
And a respect for the weapon.
The swords were very well done, very attractive.
John Howe's designs were superb.
I really enjoyed getting involved with
"The Lord of the Rings" swords because it was always a question of paring it down and making the blades slimmer and making it shorter, making it more real, even though we are not talking about real swords.
The actor may turn up a year, a year and half after you first started designing that weapon.
It's therefore a great thing when you finally present the weapon to the actor.
I really enjoyed working with Richard Taylor and all the people at the Weta Workshop because they, like Bob Anderson, were sticklers for detail.
The attention to detail that these guys devoted to items that may not necessarily be visible to the camera, at least not on first viewing, but they're there.
As an actor it was wonderful to have those kind of props to you know, really help transport you to that time and place.
I liken our effects workshop as are all other effects workshops around the world, to be similar to an artisan's studio of the years past.
This is a gathering of an eclectic group of craftspeople working across an amazing array of different artistic skills coming together.
It's a really exciting thing to be part of that.
As a designer you can draw your heart out.
You can draw hundreds, hundreds of designs that you love but if the man making them doesn't understand then there's, you know, it's-- Everyone's disappointed.
We're incredibly fortunate to have a fellow named Peter Lyon, who was the metal worker, the swordsmith on the movie.
And he's someone who understands what weapons and armor are and he did these amazing blades.
The forging techniques I use are some ways they're similar and some ways they're different from the old techniques.
With sword blades I'll start with a bar of spring steel.
Usually, I'll cut and grind that and then if necessary, forge it.
We use bronze, wood, leather, and various other materials that were used in period.
The main difference really, is that today with mass production and steel foundries and so on, that we can get things to a much more consistent standard.
And essentially they're a lot easier to get and work with.
The style of the sword, the level of decoration, the aging on it, they all tell you a bit about whether this character is a new person, whether they're an old warrior.
It's a really lovely experience when the actors begin to take ownership of them.
Bob very much encouraged you to be familiar with this weapon, which in some cases is your livelihood.
Yes, it's only a movie, but, the more you can feel like it's not a movie, the better the movie.
Actors on the stage also demonstrate swordplay through real-time fight choreography.
[BLADES CLASHING]
[BLADES CLASHING]
[GRUNTING]
Doing it on the stage is so very difficult.
They have to remember every blow.
On the films you can take a part of the fight, film it, do it once, twice, 15 times if necessary.
You get one chance on stage.
But you've got to be really good to be a good stage swordfighter.
When you've gone to the out, and it comes in with a thrust, you turn, and your hand is stopped here and as you do it, you transfer that all in one fast move.
You try to hit him on the head with the cross part of your sword.
Now if he hangs on to his sword you pull him down and you hit him under the chin with the pommel.
But he knows that, what he does is he lets go.
Then I go to hit him, he has the advantage now and that's why you see them in the manuals.
The thing that we call a glissar, which means to glide, is which leads you straight at his belly.
In the 18th century the move still comes into swordplay.
We attack each other's chest, he comes back,
I stretch him on the lunge, and the glissar could disarm him.
So there is the same movement over a period of 200 years with different weapons it still has the same intention.
All those moves, you're trying to find out what the other one's doing.
Now you can do the glissar and then they all join together.
It's eye contact, it's distance, it's balance, it's timing and it's intent.
I was looking at Andy's eyes, I can see everything that his body's doing but I can also see Dad standing there and I can see 180 degrees in front of me.
Again the arm goes first, the reality obviously the arm plunge down or through the throat.
See, there won't be a second performance so we keep the arm, shoulder, the body looking as though it's going towards the throat but at the last moment we turn the point.
And to make it real, he then defends and turns away.
'Cause I don't trust him.
I feel that I might get hit so I then use the dagger to make sure that the sword has actually missed me.
You cut, and you hit him, and you take his intestines out.
You hope.
The reason I don't hit him is because as I cut him, my elbow is pulling the sword back into me.
The skill that that needs is just as great as the skill of killing him is, of course, sometimes the difference of about 2 inches.
[SWORDS CLASHING]
The point of choreography in a play or a movie is to forward the story.
If it does that it is successful.
It's not designed to actually show a real fight, it's designed to show something exciting with swords.
There's an undeniable romanticism attached to it all.
And there's even the grittier films, I think, tend to steer clear of much of the mechanics of what a sword does to a human body.
And it has to look good on the screen.
I think, you know, I honestly believe that a real fight would be very short, sharp.
It's not just a piece of an, though it can be appreciated that way.
It's not just a piece of history because they were used for a purpose.
It is an ancient weapon that was used to gain or lose kingdoms.
There's always been fighting.
There's never been a time when there hasn't been personal combat.
People are interested in combat and cared about combat from the highest to the lowest in the land;
Kings, and princes, emperors.
A sword as a weapon is something that pretty much everyone would have owned it in the Anglian Period, anyone being an adult male.
So, from top to bottom of society personal combat was important.
Few subjects have received such unfortunate neglect by historians than the martial arts of western Europe although ancient kings and nobles gave the blade great credence during their time, often modern academics fail to clearly write about the reality of the blade, defining its practice
as something apart from its actual use.
It's quite a popular subject, the history of dueling.
And you look at these books and one thing they never mentioned is the fighting.
You know, you'd think that this was the raison d'etre of a duel.
But the one thing they never mentioned was techniques of combat.
It's a subject that has been ignored for the most pan for centuries.
Probably the world's foremost scholar on historical fencing,
Dr. Sidney Anglo, broke open the subject.
He said, "Hey historians, you've missed the boat."
I'm sure that a lot of historians still find it kind of not a proper subject.
That it isn't something that historians should be writing about.
Which, of course is foolish.
Think it's perhaps not a very nice thing, you know, these people cutting each other to pieces and running each other through and so forth, and often killing each other, and if they didn't kill each other they often maimed each other.
Originally fencing meant simply the art of defense;
The noble science of defense.
We have lots of records of there being fencing schools all over the place and we also have records of people complaining about fencing schools and the noise and the violence that they engendered.
This changed bit by bit into the late 16th and 17th century when they became more fashionable for nobles to go to these schools and to learn how to fence.
Yet today, there are too few historians that fully understand
Yet today, there are too few historians that fully understand the significant role of medieval masters.
And so to a large extent much of their history is lost to us.
The sobering death toll of the First World War spoke plainly the truth that the romance of war was officially lost in time.
The one-on-one dueling spirit of the sword could not prevail under the shadow of automatic machine gunfire with its gruesome wake of millions who were all too soon forgotten.
With the increased use of firearms during the turn of the century the slow erasure of classical sword fighting from public consciousness seemed almost inevitable.
Fortunately the romance of swordplay remained in the hearts of early filmmakers who kept it alive through imagination and fantasy.
But would the lost an of sword defense every truly be reborn?
It was a change from battlefield techniques and fighting skills for judicial combat and for private duel and for street level self-defense to essentially gentlemen having private affairs of honor, identical swords;
Single sword against single sword.
Most duels back in the day were not to the death;
Most duels back in the day were not to the death;
They were just to first blood.
During the 1700s you had guns beginning to supplant the sword as the choice weapon for dueling and in the mid-1800s fencing became more and more a sport.
People started, you know, playing the game instead of training to actually duel.
The term fencing today is primarily synonymous with the collegiate and Olympic sport of epee, foil, and saber.
Now it's based on hooking yourself up into an electric circuit and depressing tips.
You can just slip it in anywhere, as long as you slip it in on target, then it's a good touch for you.
Fencing became more and more a sport and there's a lot of aspects of fencing that are fun.
Anybody who wants to learn how to use a sword should go into fencing because it teaches you the handling of the weapon.
I like the honor aspect and the dueling history that goes along with it.
Modern fencing has retained a lot of the values of Renaissance fencing in the way we always salute before and after our bouts.
The thing that I like about fencing is that it allows me to do a physical but also a mental sport.
It's much more a thinking game than it is a physical game despite the fact that it's a tremendously athletic endeavor.
Tips of fencing blades go as fast as 135 miles an hour.
Fencers have very quick reflexes, a lot of leg strength.
You have to deal with someone attacking you before you can go.
And fencing is straight forward and back.
They're used to people reacting to their moves in a particular sort of ways.
There's a whole language of this very highly refined sport.
It's not real, though.
And it's been 200 or 300 years of evolution away from people nicking one another or cutting one another or killing one another with swords.
There are very specific penalties for brutality and hitting a little bit too hard and if the referee in control of the bout, if they thought it was with malicious intent or too hard or anything like that you can get penalized,
docked points, thrown out of the tournament.
You will see coupes, flicks, where the electric connection on the end will score but if you had a point you're making a little bitty nick where as the classical fencer will stick you.
I can get my rapier and leverage him there and come in here and put it into him.
I was sparring with some friends who were fencers and as he lunged I slapped the blade aside with my left hand and extended my right and stabbed him.
And he said, "You can't do that."
And I said, "But I just did."
I can engage it and take it out this way.
Then he said, "But that's illegal."
And I said, "I'm not interested in legalities,
I'm trying to kill you."
They have no problem grabbing you by the waist and knocking you to the ground and beating you over the head with their sword.
He does a lunge at me, I would kick that leg out from him and I'm gonna half sword my rapier.
This wouldn't occur to a fencer.
Fencing masters, my fencing coaches would say,
"Well yeah, you can't do that;
"You can't grab his leg, you can't kick him, you can't trip him, you can't push him."
People weren't dumb in the 1100s.
They had their own styles or whatever but they were much more all encompassing in terms of combat than this kind of fencing is.
We don't think of this as fighting.
There's a lot of aspects of fencing that are fun, but you can't take their rules and things too seriously because they just don't work in a straight fight.
The evolution of fencing is rather simple.
Historical swordplay transitioned to classical fencing upon the advent of the gun.
Over the past century, sport, or Olympic fencing was developed from classical fencing.
Modern sport fencing is not necessarily an advancement of historical European martial ans but rather a pruning down from older more inclusive fighting systems.
In time, proper decorum and stylized posture came to replace combat utility.
By the 19th century, fighting men no longer needed to learn and use diverse arms and armor and had fewer occasions to employ such skills.
Not surprisingly, what was not modified and adapted from the wider craft consequently withered and died.
As they pursued a far more specialized form of gentlemanly fencing, directed towards duels of honor with single identical swords, they came to dismiss and sometimes even ridicule older fencing skills.
At the same time, fencing became more sport-focused and in the 19th century it increasingly lost its military or self-defense value.
Those who continued to duel did so under less and less lethal terms.
The popular myth of crude and clumsy medieval swords slowly evolving into more superior thrusting swords began to surface at this time.
Ancient European martial arts were now officially lost in time.
[SINGING]
If you look at our society there are a large number of subcultures from reenactment, from Revolutionary War to even reenactment of World War ll.
It's interesting in that it puts the human being back in to where he should be;
Into the middle of it.
It's an interesting way to study history and it's a lot more fun than sitting there with a book.
This is an epee blade.
This is what we originally started using for fencing in the SCA.
It's the same type of blade that's used in strip fencing that you would see at the colleges.
The strip fencing is more of a sport.
It's not really dedicated to the medieval martial arts of the sword.
What I have here looks more like a real sword.
It's heavier but it is still designed to be safe, to bend without breaking.
It has more of the weight of a real medieval sword, so we can start to use the techniques as they would have been used in the Middle Ages with a proper weighted weapon.
Well, it's a wide spectrum of things;
It goes from people dressed as Orchs to very serious people who weave their own cloth.
There is an individual fulfillment that the individual becomes somebody more than just a small cog in a large plastic machine.
Historical reenactment folks have got their own culture and it's an amazing thing.
It's a great to be in but it's a whole gestalt for them.
It's a whole lifestyle for them.
What we do is to create a persona, each of us who joins.
My name is Greg Prevost in the real world.
In the SCA, I'm known as Janos of Kitmendown, which is Welsh and it's hard to spell.
You create the clothing, the equipment for that person and you become that person at the events.
I take the name Achbar lvanalli.
That name actually derives from Andalusian Spain so it's Moorish.
And my title in the SCA is King currently.
But I'm also a knight in the SCA.
Once you get knighted you are knighted for life so it's like a lifetime achievement award.
This is a very family-oriented society.
Everyone's welcome.
I have four children and all of them have been to their first event when they were weeks or months old.
My oldest son is 11 now and I'm starting to teach him how to fence.
We don't chop each other in this sport.
There's a thrust and there's a draw cut.
Every kingdom is ruled by a king and queen.
They are chosen by combat.
When all the fighters come forward and they have a best two-out-of-three elimination tournament.
You call the wound as accurately as you can what it would have done to you if it had been a real sword.
For instance, if you get hit a legal blow to your leg, you then have to drop your knees and fight from the ground which compromises your mobility quite a bit.
Your opponent has the option of being chivalrous and also taking the same handicap so that the match continues to be equal but he doesn't have to.
It's on his honor.
If he does agree, takes up that handicap, then he is lauded by the audience for his chivalry.
If I get hit with a solid blow that would have been killing with a real sword, I will act out that death.
We don't say that we are dead, we say we are disinclined to continue.
People see us fight from a distance at first they think of Medieval Times, strictly for the entertainment of people watching.
The SCA's completely different.
It's an actual sport.
We're competing.
Every blow thrown out there is thrown with real force.
We don't know who, when we step on the field, will win and we don't know who will be the next king until the last blow is thrown in the tournament.
It's just a different spin off of the same basic history.
The creative part is we take the best pans of the Middle Ages and we try to recreate them;
The beauty, the pageantry.
We leave behind the plague and the death.
I think that reenactment is an interesting and valid,
I feel like, approach to-- Approach to history, it can be a very rich, rich, rich source of information.
It's also a little bit dangerous, because reenactment is now becoming a part of history itself which troubles me quite a bit.
When you take a pipe and you wrap it with some padding and you whack on one another that's no different from reality than we who fence with electronic gear that lets us know whether or not a touch would have happened.
If the swords were actually sharp, most of these guys really wouldn't be doing this.
And I wouldn't be either.
There are many martial arts within the Asian culture.
Out of China you have manta style, tiger style, eagle style, wing tsun.
From Korea, you have taekwondo, kongsoodo, soobahkdo, kwonbup, taekyun, hapkido, yudo, gumdo, gumsool.
Out of Japan you have the very familiar karate, judo, kendo.
Out of the Philippines you have escrima or amis.
Out of Thailand you have muy thai.
Out of Burma you have bando and I'm sure there are many, many others.
When you hit a target area, you have to say where you're hitting;
So, "head," "wrist," "side."
Hua-mo-ah!
Just coming in and hitting is not considered a point.
I have to have proper etiquette.
I have to make a pronounced step.
I have to hit the proper part of my sword which is in between this leather piece and this leather piece.
Ah-oo!
I have to either go forward or backward.
Hua!
My body, my mind, and my sword have to be all in unison.
The idea is you're becoming one with your weapon.
In the '70s and the '80s, movies increased our interest in Asian martial arts.
Hey, wouldn't a fly-swatter be easier.
Man who catch fly with chopstick, accomplish anything.
Today when people hear the term martial ans they immediately bring to mind fighting ans from the East such as karate and taekwondo.
There's a more esoteric concept to kill someone efficiently that is more than just killing someone and that, in my opinion, is absent within the Western swording styles as opposed to Eastern.
In many respects you can say the West had the same attitude that the Japanese had but we handled it differently.
So there's nothing really different in these things.
We have a tendency to forget that the West had their own tradition of martial arts as well.
European fighting skills tend to sort of get relegated to something that was very son of crude and basic, which it wasn't.
What's funny is they don't seem to remember that the human body's the same the world over.
And it depends on how your body moves and that's governed by body mechanics.
It's 'somewhat amusing to have a Débute of the oriental martial arts glancing through a European manual on, say wrestling, or hand-to-hand combat and say,
"Oh wow, this is done almost like the Japanese."
Things from Asia and Japan are viewed as being son of pinnacle of fighting skills and as skillful as they were, we were just as skillful here.
But what we did was we forgot about them.
As you're comparing the two, look how quickly the West seized on the firearm and made great use of it.
Whereas in Japan it was used for a brief period of time until once the Tokugawa Shogunate was established, they were banned because this would destroy the social culture.
When a peasant could blast a samurai from 50 yards away, it was unthinkable.
Martial arts from the East of very hierarchical being orally transmitted from one person to the next.
Pretty much, it was a heredity thing because you had to be born a samurai.
So it was essentially father to son, master to disciple.
When of course the big difference is the schools and some of the oriental schools continued to flourish.
How far they're teaching exactly the same sorts of things they taught in the past, is only anybody's guess.
You remember the game where you whisper and then you whisper to the next, by the time it gets to the end this thought is all different.
Eastern martial arts have a long and continuous history where in the West martial arts, with the sword in particular, died down a lot after the Renaissance.
As the gun improved the sword was relegated and became less and less important.
People stopped training and teaching in the old arts.
There was no necessity, no need to learn those things anymore.
So we have essentially a break in the history of the sword in the Western world.
What was the sword, and how was it used?
Before practical swordplay developed into a gentlemen's ritual of single dueling, masters of defense flourished across Europe.
Many of the surviving manuscripts detailing their combative systems remained largely obscure for centuries, until now.
Today historical fencing studies are on the rise and an unprecedented revival of these extinct combative systems is now underway.
[MUSIC]
The West had its own martial arts tradition exactly as the Orient did, exactly the same.
There's been a renaissance, so to speak, in the study of the sword offering us a lot of insight that had been lost in the several hundred years since the sword was truly relevant to combat.
The work of people in making very accurate recreations of the sword in terms of form as well as the manner in which they would handle, and then those martial artists who are taking these accurate recreations, moving them in space, and working out
what was possible and what isn't possible.
All across Europe, the Americas and around the world historical European fight clubs have emerged with the desire to study the original combative systems of both Europe and the ancient world.
They have set out to practice with a different kind of energy and intensity separate from the reenactment and sport fencing groups.
We're trying to discover something that's always been there and has been forgotten and it's a lot of work to obviously, to try to understand what was lost.
It's a part of our history in Europe and I think that's very important.
This is actually our history.
This is actually how we fought.
Historical European martial arts is the study of Europe's traditional fighting systems.
I'm doing this because I had previously studied
Asian martial arts and I wanted to study martial arts related to my own culture and the place that I'm from.
Martial arts from Japan or China or southeast Asia, as valid as they are, I wanted something that was from my culture and for me.
I came from a long background of doing martial arts so I wanted to see how modern arts compared to the old arts and it seems that their standard was every bit as complicated as ours, and possibly more so.
If you look at modern sport fencing and kendo, and the like, they've actually become simplified versions of these great complex systems, which are actually brutal.
It's our past, it's part of our culture actually.
Today historical European martial arts groups are reclaiming the ancient fighting techniques and studying the diversity of arms and armor.
For me I think the sword is like what it was in the medieval time.
What matters is the man on the other side.
The difference between the medieval sword and the Japanese sword is that the Japanese put their soul into the sword.
In medieval time, what matters was to put the other man into the sword.
There's no such thing as just a sword.
It's a weapon for killing people and I'm learning how to do it efficiently.
To me the sword is... cool.
For centuries these ancient fighting skills
For centuries these ancient fighting skills have not been practiced.
Historical fencing students are now learning to reconstruct martial arts that have been until now, extinct.
We're having to try and rediscover what the fight masters of the time were thinking and how they formulated their techniques and how they evolved.
So there's quite a strong academic side to it in the western martial arts.
We're essentially resurrecting this from books.
Just as European scholars wrote down every other art and science, the science of defense was also documented and recorded.
Many of the old fighting manuals and treaties that were written during the 15th and 16th centuries have recently been rediscovered and are now being studied worldwide.
We focus on mainly German manuals but also Italian manuals, 15th century and 16th century.
My personal favorite is Talhoffer.
For the most part the Italian books, the German books and the Spanish books on the fighting arts have been forgotten, hidden in old libraries and monasteries in old archives and universities.
Unfortunately, very little research had been done on them.
For the most part, they had not been looked at for hundreds of years.
Today these old texts are once again being systematically studied and the ancient fighting skills are being reborn.
In the text the old masters actually request that the students study the source literature and in one instance they ask that they add to the text, bringing their own ideas to it and expanding upon it.
These arts existed in various forms because they evolved together hand in hand with the societies that created them.
There's nothing equivalent to that in any of the other world's traditional martial arts.
They don't have the volumes of technical literature that we have.
This is our western tradition.
A lot of people learn martial arts from people who learned it from somebody else so often times it's many generations removed from someone with real combat experience.
These books, they're written by the source.
There's a play in Wallerstein, specifically, where the caption says something like:
The swordsman have captured each others' swords.
I thought how that would never happen in a fight and I that following week I was in a bind with a guy who spun out and we were standing just like the play showed, and so that, all of a sudden,
becomes like a direct link back to that time.
How did they communicate their systems to absent third party?
This is combination of words and images where you have a kind of notation where you can almost read the movements like we'd read in music.
It combines a ground plan, where your feet go, a representation of how you hold the weapon.
You can see the relationship between the swords, horizontally as well as vertically because it casts a shadow and, of course, scores of postures, the overall attempt to convey what the author wants his student to understand.
This is the source literature.
This is what's going to tell us how they did it back then and this is how we should be doing it again today.
When one looks at books on arms and armor, the incredible detail and diversity of design in such weaponry is apparent.
Therefore, it stands to reason that there should be an equally sophisticated manner of using such weapons.
I was inspired by the works of a gentleman named
Ewan Oakeshott".
Oakeshott was considered the world's leading authority on European swords, on medieval swords in particular.
Most academics look on them as quaint curiosities, but they have no real concept of what that sword was used for or even how it was used.
Ewart made it into what it was.
These were weapons made for young men to kill other young men;
A real weapon used by real people.
The typology of the sword that Ewart Oakeshott devised included a classification for all historical blades.
Oakeshott's classifications unlocked the mythical doors that had obscured the true history of European martial combat.
I think if you look at any Anglo Saxon blades, for example, or Viking blades, ordinary warriors might have a long knife and a spear and a shield, but they don't have the sword.
There are very few swords in comparison to the number of axes or spears.
Spearheads and axes a blacksmith can make.
You have to be a swordsmith to get the technology to be able to make a sword.
I feel a real connection to the ancient smiths because I like doing it with the tools that they had, with the fuel that they had, with just clay and water and a hand hammer and charcoal.
I have a modern shop, too.
I've got air hammers and gas forgers and electric kilns which I used for experimentation and making sure that what I think is happening the ancient way is actually happening with some modern tests.
What really affects me is the chemistry.
Say, "Well how do they make stuff from iron sand, from dirt, basically?"
It's kind of magic.
The more I learned about it the more I realized there's different ways that different cultures did it so I had to try that.
I don't like just reading about it and putting a book on the shelf.
I want to do it until I get it right which causes a whole lot of sleepless nights and a lot of work and a lot of trial and error.
I feel that a collector like myself does at least have some utility to those attempting to rediscover the sword.
I can provide a swordsmith such as Paul the opportunity to make very careful measurements so that some of the original swords which have survived--
Rediscovering the way in which they were put together to give great performance even with materials and techniques that are primitive by today's technological standards.
Well, sometimes there is a debate going:
Ls the Japanese sword better?
Or the Chinese sword?
Or the Chinese taught the Japanese their techniques, so basically it's just a refined Chinese sword.
Well, no the European swords are better--
No whoots, Indian-type blades are better.
I've been working a lot of these traditions and I'm finding more similarities of how they solved their problems than I am finding differences.
But they have different ways of doing them, different ways to stack them.
Some of them using twists some of them didn't use twisted steel.
But they solved the problems in a very similar fashion.
And that really intrigued me.
I figured out some things that were wrong in books, things that weren't written in books, and other things that I feel are right by actually doing them and trying them and testing the swords and breaking swords,
analyzing things.
I enjoyed getting primary knowledge.
Definitely people who smelt their own steel and test their own blades and make all things--
Where I feel the connection is sitting back there with the fire going and pumping the bellows with everything quiet and just me and forging that blade.
In 2006 a suitcase in the attic of a well-loved and deceased archaeologist was literally saved from history's dust bin.
THE TREASURE INSIDE:
A sword, 13 centuries old.
Since then the sword has been tested extensively by the Royal Armories and the Bamburgh Research Project in a effort to unlock the secrets of this rare object's hidden past.
This is one of the most significant swords found by Brian Hope-Taylor in his 1960s excavation.
It remained in his possession up until his death in 2001 at which point it came back to the castle.
When you hold it today it has an almost mystical quality to it.
It looks like a corroded lump of metal but in its glory this would have been an awe inspiring sight.
The x-rays revealed it to be an extraordinarily sophisticated piece of technology.
It proved to be an incredibly important weapon.
One of the most important weapons,
I think it's fair to say, ever found in Britain.
It's actually composed at its central core of six strands of iron which are worked and twisted and welded together.
On the edge of that is added a steel seventh element, if you like, in a technique called Patton welding.
An iron core with a forge-welded steel edge, so you get the flex and strength of the iron with the extreme cutting power of the steel.
Which is incredibly tough and quite springy and flexible, so it won't break very easily.
You'd rather have a sword softer, take a set, take a bend, than break.
Because a broken sword in your hand during a battle, you're done.
I wouldn't want to be the smith that the customer came back to with his brother's broken sword in his hand going,
"Hey, why did you make this so brittle?"
If a warrior would go into battle with a sword that was excessively hard and brittle the battle for him could be very short indeed.
There's only a handful like this in the world, probably four or five in the entire world.
Experts we've talked to in the British Museum of the Royal Armories don't know of a single example of a six stranded sword prior to this one being identified which does suggest that they are- something of this
technological sophistication is staggeringly rare.
If you were actually have looked in the home of a medieval warrior or a warrior in another culture of a century or 2 ago, often the sword would've really, you know, represented the most technologically advanced item in the house.
It represents the epitome of technology of weapons technology of its age.
It is, I suppose in a modern analogy, something like a stealth fighter.
The one thing I can say with certainty is that it's very, very difficult to make one of these.
You wouldn't let a smith who knew the secrets of making a sword like this wander about.
They would have been kept closely guarded by the king.
The information would have been an incredibly jealously guarded secret.
The process is very long and very arduous and requires an incredible level of skill.
He would have had a mastery of metals.
He would have known exactly when to take it from the fire, which bits to forge, how hard to hit it, when to hit it, more importantly when not to hit it.
One single blow can shatter a blade like this easily if it's at the wrong temperature.
Literally tens of thousands of hammer blows have to be fight.
When you manufacture a blade like this you don't just make it, you live it, and you dream about it and you think about it every single moment.
It would often reflect the very best craftsmanship and some of the best applied art of that culture.
I generally try to see how all the pieces were put together because Patton welding is quite a complicated process.
That would have been translated into a 3-D reconstruction in the computer of how it was put together.
There is a cleanliness of line and an economy of weight to make it efficient, durable, as light as possible.
I'm continually impressed to no end of how beautiful all these objects are.
High-end warriors and kings who can do what they want with precious metals and precious stones.
The idea that they don't need to because the sword itself is so precious, I think, speaks volumes.
There must have been quite a lot of thought on the pan of the regular soldier to actually preserve the blade from damage.
Simply to employ a person of the caliber of the individual who made this would have cost a fortune, would have cost an absolute fortune.
If you look at old swords you can tell which ones have had to be used to parry or bone break.
You can tell bone breaks, too.
It's actually notched and chipped along both sides which does suggest that it has been used repeatedly in battle.
A sword of this quality would have been owned by someone who was incredibly important.
It was probably owned by one of the kings of Northumbria, possibly by several of them which does suggest
200 or 300 years of use.
So it may of well been an heirloom of the Northumbrian Royal House, passed down from generations basically from one king to another.
A sword like this, I think, would have inspired absolute terror.
When you're in battle and you see a sword of this quality coming towards you, you would know immediately that the person who wielded a sword like this was someone who had spent their entire life training to be a warrior,
who lived their life by the sword.

Contrary to popular notions, the medieval long sword
Contrary to popular notions, the medieval long sword is surprisingly light, weighing an average of only 3 pounds and capable of blindingly fast attacks.
Sword combatants use both footwork and the ability to manipulate timing and distance to enhance the swords cutting and thrusting capabilities.
One of the primary principles of swordplay is to attack and defend at the same time where every attack contains and defense and every defense contains a counter attack.
Picking up a sharp implement and cutting someone, you know you can teach that very quickly, however the strategy behind it-when to attack, when not attack-that is a very mental pursuit.
The subtle movements, the deceptions, the trickery, where I look over here, move and strike someplace else.
When you start fencing with medieval swords, then you discover that there is more to it than actually using just the blade.
There's different angles and lots of things that it's not obvious for the normal person in using the sword.
Levering with the sword to try to disarm the other guy, bashing with the cross, pommel.
Historically European martial artists believe that it is important to study and practice the techniques with great energy and intensity.
From the manuals we can see the diversity of the ancient masters' skills.
They studied two weapon combinations:
Sword with shields, swords with buckler, and swords with daggers.
Often they considered unarmored and well as armored fighting, mounted as well as on foot.
Generally the ancient masters always integrated armed and unarmed skills, never practicing fencing without also including grappling and wrestling techniques.
Most of these combats probably ended on the ground.
When he's down on the ground and I'm using all my weight to shove my sword through him, then I can penetrate.
In order to comprehend the sword, you need to comprehend all the techniques surrounding the actual use of swords.
Contrary to what you see at Ren fairs and what you see in Hollywood movies, armored fighting is not about using the edge of the sword.
It's not gonna penetrate that breast plate or that plate leg armor so they have to come up with another way of defeating a man in armor and that method is primarily half swording.
The manuals are full of this technique.
I grab my own blade and I use it as a thrusting weapon.
I can shorten the blade by doing this and make it much stiffer so I have accuracy and enough strike to penetrate his armor.
I have to thrust it in, and put some weight behind it and really drive it.
Fencing does not allow you to use the left hand and I have heard people tell you or say that the left hand is for balance.
It has nothing to do with balance.
We're constantly using this hand, so if he makes an attack- if I have to I'll use elbow, forearm, anything I need to.
Now in classical fencing or dueling manuals you see slapping the blade as a constant thing.
In fact, you will see that most of the time with the left hand up here in a position to slap.
He makes a thrust and I have to get to here,
I'm gonna disarm him.
You have to do freeplay, you have to do an intense amount of mock combat.
You have to do it with as realistic a way as possible.
[MUSIC]
Today we do a lot of sitting.
You know we sit in front of our computers.
We sit in front of our televisions.
We sit on the way to work, then we get to work and we sit.
Then we go home and we sit again and then we're laying down.
In the medieval renaissance eras people didn't.
They did a lot of walking and a lot of riding and a lot of running.
I think we have no idea how much like rawhide these people must have been back in, you know, 5 or 6 centuries ago.
I think we're very soft nowadays despite our efforts to remain, you know, fit.
[MUSIC]
I was a sword nut at 12, so me and one of my friends went out.
I was a sword nut at 12, so me and one of my friends went out.
We immediately went "bang, bang, bang,"
started fencing with them.
And after it was over with, I had two hacksaws because you know it just ruins the edge.
Well I was shocked and upset because this wasn't what happened in the movies.
Movie combat is really a curious undertaking because it's not very realistic, generally.
It doesn't portray how the historical weaponry actually performs and handles.
It's one of my favorite themes actually that that metallic noise that a sword makes coming out of a scabbard which makes no sense.
Swords don't make a noise when they come out, you know.
It's, life as a fantasy.
It doesn't reflect the way human beings actually behave in violent, personal armed combat.
Mainly when you see movies nowadays, they always focus on techniques even in moves displaying medieval Europe.
They always focus on Asian techniques and et cetera, and that's not our way, so to speak.
Western martial arts, you know, that's, you know, whether it be English, Italian, French, Spanish, there are specifics to those styles and those weapons that are ignored in most of the movies these days.
It's like a huge pot of soup with many, many ingredients.
You know they're hybrids, really.
They're not true to western martial arts, I wouldn't say, for the most pan because they're mixing in elements of Asian martial arts that have no place there, really if you want to be realistic.
So you have a little bit kung fu, and a little bit of, you know, a little bit of everything.
Most of the time a lot of these movies are very good.
The problem that I have with it is that a lot of people in the audience think this is the way you use a sword.
It's purely for entertainment;
This is true.
But it certainly makes my job harder.
WE TEACH PEOPLE:
No, your sword's not going to cut through a guy with plate armor;
No you can't out through--
Cut a Z in somebody's chest.
But you can do other things and they're even more interesting because they're real.
Many who study classical fencing and European martial ans believe that if you give the audience more realism combined with credible performances then they will enjoy and embrace it.
I think that now there's a generation of moviegoers and readers who are ready for that, and they're asking for that.
Classical fences and historical European martial artists and scholars have now shown that there is a wonderful craft out there that has been lost but that can now be made to exist again.
There have, recently there are some movies that have been focusing a little bit on European martial arts.
Good examples of films that feature combat based on specific historical swordsmanship include "Rob Roy," "Gladiator,"
"Troy," "Kingdom of Heaven" and "Alatriste."
In some few oases people are more in tune and do a better job of researching and being true to the style of the period.
As I said, Bob does this very well.
For example, in "Alatriste,"
they're not what Bob would call sword-slapping scenes, you know.
His goal is always credibility, naturalism, fights the way they would be and the reason that people are careful going in and they're, once they commit they commit fully is because even a small wound in those times-
infection and you could die just from that.
You're going in to kill and it's over with very quickly.
They were violent, you know, shockingly violent at times and there were very real, dangerous consequences to mixing it up with swords.
In many regards it is to the high fantasy of film that we are indebted for today's resurgence of western martial ans.
Movies have inspired many talented individuals to take up the sword in an effort to rediscover its true martial significance.
The resurgence of authentic European martial arts has been growing exponentially over time.
Over the years it has actually become influential in cinema.
Historical European martial arts are neither reenactment nor sport fencing.
They're in a category all of their own.
This fresh approach to training takes history into account striving to improve both its practice and authenticity.
Our lives don't depend on this craft.
Our lives don't depend on this craft.
Nobody's going to challenge us to a duel at the mall with a rapier.
Nobody's going to ambush us in the parking lot with a bastard sword, so we have to have alternative reasons for why we're doing this.
We do this, I think, because it needs to be done.
And hopefully it will increase everyone's understanding and awareness of how European warfare was conducted.
They will be appreciated for as effective and as elegant and as useful as anything the rest of the world has to offer.
All these things that have been forgotten needs to be found again.
In an age where truth seems so far from us, symbol of the sword shines bright.
The journey it takes to become good with your blade, to become good with your sword, that takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, and that changes a person, matures a person.
Obviously in the process it is going to teach you to become a better man.
We hope to be-who knows-- Someday a better swordsman, maybe even mildly average swordsman.
It would be more than I would ever expect.
What story can an ancient sword tell us?
I can't say I really understand the sword as of yet, but hopefully one day I will be there.
Eventually, I would like my studies to take me to the great heights of beating my instructor- the first woman to ever do so.
Sword fighting is kind of different and looked like good fun and I've been a couple of times and it is good fun.
While those who train today have only begun to scratch the surface, they are slowly beginning to lift the shadow.
You know, it's all those dreams that you really can't have any more 'cause you've grown up.
People are often looking backwards in time to see whereabouts we've come from.
Even in the '50s, progress was happening.
People were looking forward and now we've reached a point,
I think, where we're looking all around, trying to find meaning to what's happening.
People need to feel that sense of identity with their past and their history.
There's nothing richer than history.
History is, you know, history is, all of us over thousands of years.
I've been doing martial arts for over 20 years now.
I've noticed my body changing and I'm getting older and things are a little bit more difficult.
However, I don't give up on that.
I train myself harder so it becomes very, very mental.
Your body goes away, but your mind should stay sharp.
So I get a bit more gray and a little more stooped.
As long as I can swing a hammer,
I'm just going to keep doing this.
Within the sword lies the power both to protect and to rule.
It can be used for great evil or for great good;
To control a people or stop the hordes of a tyrant;
To break the rightful will of a nation or to set the truth free and every man a king over his own fate.
A good swordsman does not take lightly unsheathing his sword.
If your sword is out, it means that you intend to use it.
It's a pity, really, that we couldn't fight with rapiers today rather than guns.
It's a pity that gunpowder was invented, in my mind, because we would probably still be fighting with rapiers.
And I'd be good at it.

People do a whole lot of things in the name of love, more than I ever thought possible.
When we first made this deal, you and me,
I remember thinking about that, about love.
I never really felt it even when it was offered to me, because I knew I didn't deserve it, so I could never understand it.
A pastor I know, one of the better ones, he pointed me toward a verse in the Old Testament, went something like this:
There are three things that amaze me.
No, four things that I don't understand.
The way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship at sea, and a way a man loves a woman.
And once I got clean, I understood them all:
The eagle, the ship and even the man and the woman.
But what I knew best, what I knew from my gut, was the way of that serpent and how he can destroy even the most beautiful love of all.
Anna.
Pick up.
Wait for me.
Wait for me, okay?
Wait, okay?
Hello?
William, it's me, John.
Can you hear me?
William, I need your help again.
It's not for me.
I swear I'm clean, but it's the girl.
She might...
Hello?
William?
William?
Damn it.
Anna.
Hello?
Hello?
- John?
- William.
William, she OD'd on cocaine and heroin.
- What?
- Cocaine and heroin.
- How long?
How long?
- L...
- Get her to a hospital.
- No hospitals.
No one can know.
- How long?
- Just stopped breathing.
You took a risk by not taking her.
Anybody knows she's alive, the odds get much, much worse.
Come on.
Breathe for her now.
Just keep breathing.
Don't you jam it into her chest?
Her heart is beating.
Just do exactly as I tell you.
There.
Okay.
No.
Nobody can know.
You came to me.
My rules.
Swenton, get Akani.
Get down to the shop now.
- Let me take over.
Move.
- I love her.
I can't let her die.
You're not gonna be any help if you're sucking air yourself.
Okay.
Come on, Anna.
Anna, we gotta get out of here.
Come on, we gotta make it to Spain, baby.
- Okay, she's breathing.
- Yeah, that's it.
- Anna, good girl.
Good girl.
- Keep talking to her.
It's okay.
I told you I would come for you.
I promised.
Why didn't you believe?
Anna.
Anna, can you hear me?
- Anna.
- It's me.
It's John.
You're okay, you're alive.
It's okay.
You're doing great.
There you are.
- Hey.
Hey.
- You're gonna be okay.
Just keep breathing.
I promise you're gonna be fine.
Just a little pit stop and then we'll be on our way.
Okay.
All right, John, go outside.
Wait for me outside.
Come on.
You're in the way.
Go outside.
It will be all right.
Anna?
Hey, hey.
- Papa?
- Anna, welcome back.
- Papa?
- No, I'm just a friend.
Tell me everything you see.
What do you see?
- Anna, what do you see?
- My father.
All right.
Okay.
- Don't call my father.
- All right.
Okay.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's all right.
Don't be sorry.
You're all right.
You're okay.
So, what have you got yourself into, John?
She gonna make it?
Look, let me talk to you outside.
You're gonna make it.
So why do you think she tried to kill herself?
Supposed to meet her on the pier where we always meet, you know, and we were gonna get out of town.
Make a run for it, start over.
And?
And I was late.
I wasn't gonna leave her, William.
I'd never leave Anna.
Yeah.
Look, there's bad people out there that wanna hurt her, but I'm the one they're looking for.
As long as nobody knows she's here, she's okay.
What about me and my crew?
Nobody knows she's here, everyone's safe.
It's that simple.
You're using again, man.
You can do everything right, just like you preach, but the shit that was there when you started using,
it's waiting for you when you step back out.
Look.
Look, just stay here, all right?
Just give yourself another chance, okay?
Don't worry about me.
Just take care of Anna.
Here's my number.
Let me know when she's safe.
You're all we've got.
Don't let anyone know she's here.
Boss.
Detective Baker is outside.
John Neville here?
I sent him to you once before, William, courtesy of the taxpayers of this fine city.
I think we have a right to know whether he slipped up again.
He was here this morning, but he's not around anymore.
Get in.
You didn't keep him?
He didn't want my help.
I'm sorry.
Was Anna with him?
I don't know who you're talking about.
Anna Gonzales, daughter of Felix Gonzales.
The Querétaro Cartel that John had infiltrated before he blew his cover.
- Was she with him?
- Taxpayers asking?
I'm asking, William.
This is serious.
I need an answer.
You know what I do is confidential, right?
Would you let me talk to her?
I'm not saying that she's here, but like with any other client, unless you're family, you've gotta get a court order.
Eighteen weeks under deep cover and I could tell he was using again.
How did John look?
Same as he did when you brought him in to me the first time.
High, paranoid, delusional.
Thought everyone was after him.
Well, the only difference is this time they really are.
And I told him not to go back undercover.
Yeah, I remember.
We asked him to take a desk job, but John wanted to go right back in.
I begged him not to, but there's only so much I could do.
Only so much anyone can do.
Look, if he comes back, will you help him out again?
Look, it's not about the money, all right?
Not anymore.
You've helped out more than a few of my guys, William.
I trust you.
I know you'll keep this confidential.
If he comes back, would you let me know?
Stay dry.
Maybe your undercover cop really did snag a drug lord's daughter.
Toxicity levels are sky high.
She's definitely getting the pure shit.
Akani, you know how serious this is, right?
I mean, no one in, no one out, until she's gone.
Yeah, of course.
Do you think John's gonna come back for her, or maybe her father?
Her father is no joke.
If you want out, now's the time.
I don't have anywhere better to be.
You change your mind, anytime, I won't hold it against you.
Okay.
Come on, John.
Where are you?
Who are you?
My name is William Banks.
John hired me to help you.
Where is he?
He left.
When is he coming back?
Don't know.
Listen, you...
You OD'd on heroin and cocaine.
- Are you a doctor?
- No, I'm not.
Police?
I'm just someone who wants to get you sober.
- I am in rehab?
- Yeah, it was pretty funny when you stopped breathing for a minute.
William saved your life.
I just measured wrong.
- Oh, is that it?
- I just measured wrong.
Hey, William, we got the welcome wagon from the Medellin Cartel out front.
Don't talk to them.
They work for my father.
Can I help you?
You called a cell phone earlier that belonged to a dead man.
That cell phone belongs to us now, along with something else he stole.
I represent Felix Gonzales.
I'm sure you know who he is.
So, then, you wouldn't mind if we came in and took a look around?
Look, man, I don't know what angle you're working here, but you're not coming in today, all right?
Tell Anna her father would like to see her back home.
Tell her father I'd like to see the same thing.
That's right, William, you know what it's like to be a father.
You have a little girl too, right?
And a very beautiful home.
They might have killed John.
Now they're threatening my family.
I'll get two detectives.
Keep them out of uniform.
Tell them to keep a distance.
She'll never know.
Well, what's really going on here, Lawrence?
After he picked up his 90-day chip, John went undercover again.
After a few weeks in, he stopped being reliable.
He started using.
He fell in love with Anna and they had plans to escape.
- And that's it?
- Yep.
Two kids, they got high, they fell in love.
It's just a love story, William.
Well, a love story better not get my family hurt.
It won't.
Not with my protection.
I'll call the station and get detectives here and to your shop right away.
- Outside my house?
- You won't even know they're here.
- You just told me that they're here.
- It's just a precaution, Melissa.
Against what?
My old client has himself mixed up in some heavy shit and he walked back in my door.
So you're gonna let him walk into my door?
- I'm not letting it.
- Good.
I don't want the cops out front scaring the kids.
- I made a commitment here.
- Then unmake that commitment.
This is what I do.
This is what I am.
There's no alternative here.
There's always an alternative.
Look, I need you and the kids away from the house for a couple of days.
- That's all I'm saying.
- I can't go out of town.
I have...
I need to know that you and the kids are gonna be safe.
If helping someone puts your family at risk, then maybe you need to...
- It is not that simple.
- Make it that simple.
Put your family first, William.
I'm sorry.
Look, we are not shaping our lives around your work anymore, okay?
We're not doing it.
I don't want cops out front and we're not leaving.
Listen, Anna, I need your help.
Generally, I contact the families of addicts, see if there's any...
Does my father know I'm here?
Yeah.
I need to go.
I need to go now.
- Where are you gonna go?
- Anywhere but here.
Under normal circumstances, I'd put you in a psych ward on a 72-hour suicide watch.
- I didn't try to kill myself.
- Right, you just measured wrong?
If I stay here, you don't understand.
Everyone here is gonna die.
There are cops watching the shop and my house.
Everyone is gonna die.
That's the shop.
Anna?
- It's me.
It's me.
- John?
I thought you were dead.
- They saw me.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
- Get to the back.
Get to the back.
- Get Anna.
What is this place?
Where are we?
It's a safe house.
- I need answers.
- We just need to get out of here.
- She's not going anywhere.
- I'm fine.
See, she's fine.
She's fine.
Swenton, get him out of here.
Let's go.
Out.
- John, don't leave.
- Look, I'm not...
- William, I asked you to help her.
- No, you didn't, John.
You wouldn't try to take her out of here if you actually wanted me to help her.
I'll be right outside, okay?
I'll be right outside.
Come on.
I'll show you the gym and the spa.
Where are you going, Anna?
Where do you think you're gonna go?
I can't tell you that.
Well, wherever it is, it's never gonna work, Anna.
I mean, have you even thought about the consequences?
It's all I have thought about.
- And you still don't see.
- John is helping me.
Helping you to get high ain't helping you.
Before I met him nothing mattered.
- Now...
- Now you're both high and on the run.
I mean, have you two ever spent a sober moment together?
You don't even know each other.
I know I love him.
Well, something about him made you give up the other night, right?
I didn't give up.
You thought he left you.
You thought he abandoned you.
You had your doubts.
Maybe, but my father, I have no doubts about him.
Anything is better than staying with him.
If you're on the run, it doesn't matter where you are.
It's always gonna be in a room like this.
Nothing is gonna change.
I can...
I can talk to your father.
Let me speak to him.
He would not listen.
You don't know what he's capable of.
You have no idea.
Oh, I think I do.
I think I do.
You know why?
Because I'm a father.
I have a daughter too, just like you.
And there's nothing I wouldn't do.
There's...
There's no extreme I wouldn't take to keep my daughter safe.
So, yeah, you're right.
I don't know your father but I know what he's feeling right now.
He wants me to be a little girl forever.
He wants you to be safe.
And what's so wrong with that?
Why do you wanna save me so bad?
I thought you had someone watching the shop.
Where are you?
It's not important.
We're safe.
- Where are you?
- It doesn't matter.
But you have John?
Look, my family was threatened.
My wife won't take my phone calls.
Someone just raided the shop, and we're in hiding.
I'm gonna ask you one last time.
What did John do?
He stole drugs from Anna's father.
How much?
Enough to create a lot of problems for a lot of people.
Enough to put anyone near him at a lot of risk.
Street value: $ 12 million.
All right, 11138 Hoover.
Come pick him up.
You're living in a fantasy, man.
You don't know.
You sold her a fantasy.
That's the only thing she cares about now.
It's a different one than her father sold her, but it's just as fake.
You know what's sad, man?
Is that I actually thought that I helped you before.
You did for a while.
Well, it sure don't look like that now, does it?
I changed, William, I did.
I really did.
It's just, the world didn't change with me.
Why Anna?
I went back undercover.
I got scared.
I got hooked again.
But when I saw her, I had a reason, a real reason to get out once and for all.
All we needed was money to start a new life.
And you think stealing drugs is a good way to start a new life?
Whatever it took to get a head start.
Whatever it took for love.
Right.
- Love?
- Right.
Love.
True love.
John, just let her go.
Give her a chance.
No, we gotta get out of here, we'll get to a safe place.
We get ourselves well and then we got a chance.
- Sounds like you got another plan.
- I do.
Addicts with plans.
They never work.
This one has to.
You can't hold Anna against her will.
If she wants to come, there's nothing you can do about it.
John, as soon as you walk out of this building, you're dead.
You got that?
Anna too.
It maybe takes a minute, maybe it takes a year, but either way they will find you.
And if they don't, the drugs will do you in, all right?
Either way, you're done, man.
Either way, you're done.
Think about that.
It's okay, John, relax.
One second.
- Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?
- The department needs John back.
He's lying.
John blew his cover and that's not all.
I thought you told me everything.
I told you everything that you need to know.
- This is
- It's a setup.
Much bigger than Romeo and Juliet just getting sober.
- He's lying.
He wants Anna.
- John, no.
John.
Don't let her go back to her father, William.
William.
I mean, you want me to follow them?
He's a cop.
There's nothing we can do.
Something doesn't add up here.
Anna?
What were you gonna do with the drugs?
I don't know.
You want John to live, you better stop lying.
Lawrence promised us he would get us out.
Pay us for the drugs, get us passports, plane tickets.
Okay, I'm listening.
It was his idea, the robbery, everything.
We just wanted a chance to get out.
John was supposed to meet him and trade the drugs for money, but he thought it was a setup.
Got scared.
That's why he was late for me.
A drug-addicted undercover cop, that's a pretty good mark to pin it on.
Wait, if Lawrence is dirty?
Who's watching my house?
Let's go.
Melissa.
Ben.
Lula.
What are you doing?
Oh, God.
Okay.
- You're okay.
- Dad, what's wrong?
- What's going on?
- You scared us.
It's all right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Lula.
Come here, it's okay.
It's all right.
All right, look, go to your rooms and pack something for the night.
- You too, Ben, right now.
- William?
Everyone's spending the night at a hotel.
What is...?
Everyone is spending the night at a hotel.
Okay.
The main thing is get them situated and make sure no one's followed you.
- Of course.
- Okay.
We're ready to go.
All right, listen, Swenton is gonna take you to the hotel.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna call you guys later.
- You'll be all right.
- I'll be right there.
Thank you, Arnie.
How bad is this?
What about you, William?
Are you safe?
- Look, I'm gonna be fine.
- William, are you safe?
I gotta put things back where they belong.
Make sure my part in this is understood.
Then what?
Look, just take off, okay, please?
It's gonna be fine.
You and the kids are gonna be fine.
I'll call you, okay?
- I'll call you later.
- Yeah.
You risked your own family to help me?
This all just happened, Anna.
- No, take me back to my father.
- No.
I can tell him what happened.
I can tell him to leave you alone.
- Listen, if you go home...
- Take me back to my father.
- You deserve a chance.
- It's time for me to go home.
Welcome home.
Where's my father?
- You need to leave now.
- Leave him alone, Rodolfo.
Anna?
You stole from me.
You lied to me.
You ran away from me.
You broke my heart.
Papi, he saved my life.
Come here.
Your daughter needs help.
Please listen to him.
I'll be back.
So, what is it you want?
Let me help Anna.
Give her the same help you gave John Neville?
She has a chance to get better.
Anna deserves a chance to get better.
And if I let you help, what is it you're gonna do?
I'll encourage her to find a new life.
Without me?
Without her father.
- That's up to Anna.
- Yeah.
But you would encourage her to do that?
Yeah, I would.
You got a lot of balls, don't you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know about you.
I don't have a lot to hide.
I know all about your past too, about the people that you help.
Look, I'm not gonna lock my doors.
If you wanna come after me, I can't stop you.
You're just gonna have to take it on faith that all I wanna do here is help.
The only thing that makes sense to me is doing this for people like Anna.
So, please, let me...
Let me help your daughter.
Fine.
Anna begged for your life, otherwise you wouldn't be here,
so consider this your only warning.
Stay away from her.
Stay away from Felix.
If we ever see you again anywhere, it doesn't matter.
If we ever see you again, you are a dead man.
John?
Hey, hey, hey.
Where's Anna?
Is she still alive?
Yeah, John.
She's still alive.
Thank you, William.
All right, hang in there, pal.
Hang in there.
No, no police.
No, I gotta call an ambulance.
No, Lawrence will kill me.
He'll kill you, William.
I took him to the wrong car.
You did the right thing, okay?
Let's...
Let's get you some help, all right?
I need an ambulance.
Address is listed.
I got a young man with a gunshot wound to the gut.
No, I'm hanging up now.
Just hurry.
Now.
Okay.
I thought I could pick it all up and make it out of here with Anna.
Just hang on, okay?
The ambulance is on the way.
Okay?
Let me see.
Oh, it's not that bad.
You're gonna be all right.
Hang on.
Tell her...
Tell her I tried, William, okay?
Tell her I love her.
You'll be able to tell her yourself.
You're gonna be fine, just hang on.
You'll be all right.
I'm gonna die.
I tried to listen to you, William.
You know, I did.
- Promise me you'll help her, man.
- I'll do whatever I can.
- Here, take these keys, okay?
- Okay.
In the trunk, you can trade for Anna, okay?
That's the only way to save her.
Okay?
It's right out front.
I really messed up, didn't I, William?
No, you did fine.
Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.
Remember...
Remember...
John.
Look, he's dirty.
That's all I know.
All right, you find Lawrence, you'll get all the answers you need.
Okay, thanks.
Got it.
Lawrence.
All right.
You know what?
That car's been here for a couple of days.
It's been out in front of the shop the whole time.
That is not a small amount of cocaine.
Twelve million dollars worth.
You can't give that dope back to Felix.
William, stay out of it.
Come on, man, what are you doing?
Felix is a businessman, all right?
Everything has a price.
This goes against everything we do.
Puts all that shit back on the street.
Look, I'm gonna help the girl.
That's what I'm gonna do.
Let us help you for once.
Take your own advice.
Focus on what you can control.
Don't save Anna.
Save your family.
Save yourself.
You did it before.
Do it again.
Detox room.
You should take very good care of her.
Tell her her father said goodbye.
I got something you want.
I'm at Shoreline Pier.
I'm all alone.
Well, hand it over.
I got no beef with you, William.
The kids had it coming.
If I didn't shoot John, Felix would have.
It's all yours.
No!
That's a recorded alarm, okay?
There are four things that amaze me, even though now I finally think I've begun to understand them.
In fact, it's the very fact that I understand them that makes them so amazing.
The way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a ship at sea, the way of the serpent on a rock, and the way a man loves a woman.
And, for me, there's a fifth thing more amazing than the eagle, more inspiring than the ship, more potent than the serpent, and even more beautiful than a man and a woman.
It's the way of the family, because without them there's nothing worth loving.
People do many things in the name of love, more than I ever thought possible.
When we first made this deal, you and me, I remember thinking about that...
About love.
I never really felt it, even when it was offered to me.
Because I knew I didn't deserve it, so I could never understand it.
A pastor I know... one of the better ones... he pointed me toward a verse in the old testament.
Went something like this:
"There are three things that amaze me..."
"Four things that I don't understand:
"The way of an eagle in the sky...
The way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship at sea, and the way a man loves a woman."
And once I got clean, I understood them all:
The eagle, the ship, and even the man and the woman.
But what I knew best...
what I knew from my gut... was the way of that serpent.
And how he can destroy even the most beautiful love of all.

"Crossing the Threshold"
Anna?
Anna, it was a setup.
Wait for me.
Wait for me, okay?
Hello?
William, it's me, John.
Can you hear me?
William, I need your help again.
It's not for me;
I swear I'm clean.
But it's this... it's the girl.
She might...
Hello?
William?
Damn it!
Hey!
Anna!
Hello?
Hello?
- John?
- William,
William, she od'd on cocaine and heroin!
- What happened?
- Cocaine and heroin.
- How long, how long?
- I...
- We gotta get her to a hospital.
- No, no, no hospitals, no one can know.
- How long?
- She just stopped breathing.
- Look, you take a big risk by not getting...
- Anyone knows she's alive, the odds get much, much worse.
- Go.
- Breathe for her, now.
Just keep breathing.
Don't you jam it into her chest?
Her heart is beating.
Just do exactly as I tell you.
Okay.
- No, no!
No, nobody can know!
- You came to me, my rules.
Swenton, get Akani, get down to the shop, now.
Let me take over, move.
- I love her;
I can't let her die.
- You're not gonna be any help to her if you're sucking air yourself.
Okay...
Come on, Anna.
Come on, Anna.
We gotta get outta here.
Come on, we gotta make it to Spain, baby.
- Okay, she's breathing.
- Yeah, that's it.
- Anna, good girl.
- Keep talking to her, keep her alert.
Good girl.
It's okay;
I told you I would come for you.
I promised.
Why didn't you believe?
Hey, Anna, Anna, can you hear me?
Anna?
It's me.
It's John.
You're okay.
You're alive.
You're doing great.
You're doing great.
There you are.
Hey...
Hey.
Hey, you're gonna be okay.
Just keep breathing.
I promise you're gonna be fine.
Just a little pit stop and we'll be on our way, okay?
Okay.
All right, John, go outside.
Wait for me outside.
Come on.
You're in the way.
Go outside.
It'll be all right.
Anna, hey, hey.
Anna, welcome back.
- Papa?
- No, I'm just a friend.
Tell me everything you see.
What do you see?
Anna, what do you see?
- My father.
- All right.
- Okay.
- Don't call my father.
All right, okay.
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's all right.
Don't be sorry.
Okay, you're all right.
You're okay.
So, what have you got yourself into, John?
She gonna make it?
Look, let me talk to you outside.
I was supposed to meet her on the pier where we always meet, you know, and, uh,
we were going to get out of town.
Make a run for it, start over.
And?
And I was late.
I wasn't going to leave her, William.
I'd never leave Anna.
- Yeah.
- Look...
There's bad people out there who want to hurt her.
But I'm the one they're looking for.
As long as nobody knows she's here, she's okay.
- What about me and my crew?
- Nobody knows she's here.
Everyone's safe.
It's that simple.
You're using again, man.
You can do everything right, just like you preach.
But the shit that was there when you started using, it's waiting for you when you step back out.
Look, look, just, just stay here, all right?
Just give yourself another chance, okay?
Don't worry about me.
Just take care of Anna.
Here's my number.
Let me know when she's safe.
You're all we've got.
Don't let anyone know she's here.
Boss, uh...
Detective Baker is outside.
John Neville here?
I sent him to you once before, William, courtesy of the taxpayers of this fine city.
I think we have a right to know whether he's slipped up again.
He was here this morning, but he's not around anymore.
Get in.
You didn't keep him?
He didn't want my help.
I'm sorry.
Was Anna with him?
I don't, I don't know who you're talking about.
Anna Gonzales.
Daughter of Felix Gonzales.
Taro cartel that John had infiltrated before he blew his cover.
- Was she with him?
- Taxpayers asking?
I'm asking, William.
This is serious.
I need an answer.
Look, you know what I do is confidential, right?
Would you let me talk to her?
I'm not saying that she's here, but like with any other client, unless you're family, you gotta get a court order.
18 weeks under deep cover.
And I could tell he was using again.
How did John look?
Same as he did when you brought him in to me the first time.
High, paranoid, delusional.
Thought everyone was after him.
Yeah, the only difference is, this time, they really are.
I told him not to go back undercover.
I remember it.
We asked him to take a desk job, but John wanted to go right back in.
I begged him not to, but there's only so much I could do.
Only so much anyone can do.
Look, if he comes back, will you help him out again?
Look, it's... it's not about the money.
All right?
Not... not anymore.
You've helped out more than a few of my guys, William.
I trust you.
I know you'll keep this confidential.
If he comes back, would you let me know?
Stay dry.
Maybe our undercover cop really did snag a drug lord's daughter.
Toxicity levels are sky-high.
She's definitely getting the pure shit.
Akani, you, uh... you know how serious this is, right?
I mean, no one in, no one out, until she's gone.
Yeah, of course.
Do you think John's going to come back for her or maybe her father?
Her father's no joke.
If you want out, now is the time.
I don't have anywhere better to be.
Change your mind, anytime, I won't hold it against you.
Okay.
Come on, John, where are you?
Who are you?
My name is William Banks.
John hired me to help you.
- Where is he?
- He left.
When is he coming back?
Don't know.
Listen, you, uh...
You od'd on heroin and cocaine.
- Are you a doctor?
- No, I'm not.
- Police?
- I'm just someone who wants to get you sober.
I am in rehab?
Yeah, it was pretty funny when you stopped breathing for a minute.
William saved your life.
- I just measured wrong.
- Oh, is that it?
I just measured wrong.
Hey, William.
We got the welcome wagon from the medell cartel out front.?
Don't talk to them.
They work for my father.
Can I help you?
You called a cell phone earlier that belonged to a dead man.
That cell phone belongs to us now, along with something else he stole.
I represent Felix Gonzales.
I'm sure you know who he is.
So, then, you wouldn't mind if we came in and took a look around?
Look, man, I don't know what angle you're working here, but you're not coming in today.
All right?
Tell Anna her father would like to see her back home.
Tell her father I'd like to see the same thing.
That's right, William.
You know what it's like to be a father.
You have a little girl, too, right?
And a very beautiful home.
Look, they might have killed John, and now they're threatening my family.
I'll get two detectives.
I'll keep them out of uniform.
I'll tell them to keep a distance.
- She'll never know.
- Well, what's really going on here, Lawrence?
After he picked up his 90-day chip, John went undercover again.
After a few weeks in, he stopped being reliable.
He started using.
He fell in love with Anna, and they had plans to escape.
- And that's it?
- Yep.
Two kids... they got high, they fell in love.
It's just a love story, William.
Well, love story better not get my family hurt.
It won't.
Not with my protection.
I'll call the station and get detectives here and to your shop right away.
- Outside my house?
- You won't even know they're here.
- You just told me that they're here.
- It's just a precaution, Melissa.
Against what?
My old client has himself mixed up in some heavy shit,
- and he just walked back in my door.
- So, you're going to let him walk intomydoor?
- I'm not letting it.
- Good.
I don't want the cops out front, William, scaring the kids.
- I made a commitment here.
- Then unmake that commitment.
This is what I do.
This is what I am.
There is no alternative here.
- There's always an alternative.
- Look, I need you and the kids away from the house for a couple of days.
That's all I'm saying.
- I can't go out of town...
I have...
I...
- I need to know that you and the kids are going to be safe.
Look, if helping someone puts your family
- at risk, then maybe you need...
- It's not that simple.
Make it that simple.
Put your family first, William.
I'm sorry.
Look, we are not shaping our lives around your work anymore.
Okay, we're not doing it.
I don't want cops out front, and we're not leaving.
Listen, Anna.
I need your help.
Generally, I contact the families of addicts,
- see if there's any...
- Does my father know I'm here?
Yeah.
I need to go.
- I need to go now.
- Where are you going to go?
Anywhere but here.
Under normal circumstances, I'd put you in a psych ward on a 72-hour suicide watch.
- I didn't try to kill myself.
- Right, you just measured wrong?
If I stay here... you don't understand...
everyone here is going to die.
There are cops watching the shop and my house.
Everyone is going to die.
Back to the shop.
- Anna!
John?
It's me.
- It's me, John.
I thought you were dead.
- They saw me.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
- Get to the back.
Get to the back.
- Get Anna.
What is this place?
Where are we?
It's a safe house.
- I need answers.
- We just need to get out of here, William.
She's not going anywhere.
- I'm fine.
- See, she's fine.
She's fine.
Swenton, get him out of here.
Let's go.
Out.
- John, don't leave.
- Look, I'm not...
William,
- I...
I asked you to help her.
- No, you didn't, John.
You wouldn't be trying to take her out of here right now if you actually wanted me to help her.
I'll be right outside, okay?
I'll be right outside.
Come on.
I'll show you the gym and the spa.
Where are you going, Anna?
Where do you think you're going to go?
I can't tell you that.
Well, wherever it is, it's...
It's never going to work, Anna.
I mean, have you even thought about the consequences?
It's all I have thought about.
And you still don't see it.
- John is helping me.
- Helping you to get high ain't helping you.
Before I met him, nothing mattered;
Now...
Now you're both high and on the run.
I mean, have you two ever spent a sober moment together?
You don't even know each other.
I know I love him.
Well, something about him made you give up the other night, right?
- I didn't give up.
- You thought he left you.
You thought he abandoned you.
You had your doubts.
Maybe.
But my father, I have no doubts about him.
Anything is better than staying with him.
Well, if you're on the run, it doesn't matter where you are.
It's always going to be in a room like this.
Nothing's going to change.
I can...
I can talk to your father.
Let me speak to him.
He would not listen.
- You don't know what he's capable of.
- You have no idea.
Oh, I think I do.
I think I do.
You know why?
Because I'm a father.
I have a daughter, too, just like you, and there's nothing I wouldn't do.
There's... there's no extreme I wouldn't take to keep my daughter safe.
So, yeah, you're right.
I don't...
I don't know your father,
- but I know what he's feeling right now.
- He wants me to be a little girl forever.
He wants you to be safe.
And what's so wrong with that?
Why do you want to save me so bad?
I thought you had someone watching the shop.
Where are you?
It's not important.
We're safe.
- Where are you?
- Doesn't matter.
- But you have John.
- Look, my family was threatened.
My wife won't even take my phone calls.
Somebody just raided the shop, and we're in hiding.
I'm going to ask you one last time.
What did John do?
He stole drugs.
From Anna's father.
How much?
Enough to create a lot of problems for a lot of people.
Enough to put anyone near him at a lot of risk.
The street value: $12 million.
All right, 11138 hoover.
Come pick him up.
You're living in a fantasy, man.
- You don't know.
- You sold her a fantasy.
And that's the only thing she cares about right now.
It's a different one than her father sold her, but it's-it's just as fake.
You know what's sad, man?
Is I actually thought that helped you before.
You did.
For a while.
Well, it sure don't look like that now, does it?
I changed, William.
I did.
I really did.
It's just the world didn't change with me.
Why Anna?
I went back undercover.
I got scared.
I got hooked again.
But when I saw her I had a reason, a real reason, to get out, once and for all.
All we needed was a little bit of money to start a new life.
And you think stealing drugs is a good way to start a new life?
Whatever it took to get a head start.
Whatever it took for love.
- Right.
Love.
- Right.
Love.
True love.
John, just let her go.
Give her a chance.
No, we gotta...
Get out of here, we get to a safe place.
We get ourselves well.
Then we got...
Then we got a chance.
Sounds like you got another plan.
- I do.
- Addicts with plans.
- They never work.
- This one has to.
You can't hold Anna against her will, so if she wants to come with me, there's nothing you can do about it.
Listen to me, John.
As soon as you walk out of this building, you're dead.
You got that?
Anna, too.
Maybe it takes a minute, maybe it takes a year, but either way they will find you.
And if they don't, the drugs will do you in, all right?
Either way, you're done, man.
Either way.
You're done.
Think about that.
It's okay, John.
Relax.
- One second...
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What are you're doing?
- The department needs John back.
He's lying.
John blew his cover, and that's not all.
- I thought you told me everything.
- I told you everything that you need to know.
- This is, uh...
- It was a setup!
Much bigger than Romeo and Juliet just getting sober.
- He's lying!
- John, no!
John!
Don't let her go back to her father.
William...
William!
- I mean, you want me to follow them?
- He's a cop.
There's nothing we can do.
Some-something doesn't add up here.
Anna.
What were you going to do with the drugs?
- I don't know.
- You want John to live, you better stop lying.
Lawrence promised us he would get us out, pay us for the drugs, get us passports, plane tickets.
Okay, I'm listening.
It was his idea:
The robbery, everything.
We just wanted a chance to get out.
John was supposed to meet him and trade the drugs for money, but he thought it was a setup, got scared.
That's why he was late for me.
A drug-addicted undercover cop is a pretty good mark to pin it on.
Wait, if Lawrence is dirty...
Who's watching my house?
Let's go.
Melissa!
Ben!
Lula!
What are you doing?
!
- Oh, God, okay.
You're okay.
- Dad, what's wrong?
- What's going on?
- You scared the hell out of us.
It's all right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, lula.
Come here.
It's okay.
It's all right.
All right, look, go to your rooms and pack something for the night.
- You, too, Ben.
Right now.
- William...
- Spending the night at a hotel.
- What is...
Everyone is spending the night at a hotel.
Okay.
The main thing is to get them situated, make sure no one's followed you, all right?
- Of course.
- Okay.
- We're ready to go.
- All right, listen, swenton's going to take you to the hotel, all right?
I'm going to...
Going to call you guys later.
- You'll be all right.
- I'll be right there.
Thank you, Arnie.
How bad is this?
What about you, William?
Are you safe?
- Look, I'm going to be fine.
- William...
- Are you safe?
- I've got to put some things back where they belong, make sure my part in this is understood.
- And then what?
- Look, just take off, okay, please.
It's going to be fine.
You and the kids are going to be fine.
- I'll call you, okay?
I'll call you later.
- Yeah.
You risked your own family to help me?
This all just happened, Anna.
- No, take me back to my father.
- No.
I can tell him what happened.
I can tell him to leave you alone.
- Listen, if you go home...
- Take me back to my father.
- You deserve a chance.
- It's time for me to go home.
Welcome home.
- Where's my father?
- You need to leave now.
Leave him alone, Rodolfo.
Anna.
You stole from me.
You lied to me.
You ran away from me.
You broke my heart.
Papi, he saved my life.
Come on.
Senor.
Your daughter needs help.
Please listen to him.
I'll be back.
So what is it you want?
Let me help Anna.
To give her the same help you gave John Neville?
Look, she has a chance to get better.
Anna deserves a chance to get better.
And if I let you help...
What is it you're going to do?
I'll encourage her to find a new life.
Without me.
Without her father.
- That's up to Anna.
- Yeah.
- But you would encourage her to do that.
- Yeah.
I would.
You got a lot of balls, don't you?
Yeah, yeah.
I know about you.
I don't have a lot to hide.
I know all about your past, too.
About the people that you help.
Look, I'm not going to lock my doors.
You want to come after me, I...
I can't stop you.
You're just gonna have to take it on faith that all I want to do here is help.
I mean, the only thing that makes sense to me is doing this for people like Anna.
So, please, let me...
Let me help your daughter.
Fine.
Anna begged for your life.
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.
So consider this your only warning.
Stay away from her.
Stay away from Felix.
If we ever see you again anywhere, it doesn't matter.
If we ever see you again, you are a dead man.
John.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Where's an?
- Is she still alive?
- Yeah, John, she's still alive.
Thank you, William.
All right, hang in there, pal, hang in there.
No, no police.
I got to call an ambulance.
No, Lawrence will kill me.
He'll kill you, William.
I took him to the wrong car.
You did the right thing, okay?
Let's get you some help, all right?
I need an ambulance.
Address as listed.
I got a young man with a gunshot wound to the gut.
N... no, I'm hanging up now.
Just hurry.
Now!
- Okay.
- I thought I could, uh...
Pick it all up and, and make it out of here with Anna.
All right, just hang on, okay?
The ambulance is on the way.
Okay?
Let me see.
Oh, it's not that bad.
You're going to be all right.
- Hang on.
- Tell her... tell her I tried.
William,
- okay?
Tell her I love her.
- No, you'll be able to tell her yourself, all right?
You're going to be fine.
Just hang on.
You're all right.
I'm going to die.
I tried to listen to you, William.
You know, I did.
- Promise me you'll help her, man.
- I'll do whatever I can.
- Here, take these keys.
- Okay.
Okay, in the trunk... you can, you can trade for Anna.
Okay?
It's the only way to save her.
Okay?
It's right out front.
I really messed up, didn't I, William?
Ah, you did fine.
Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
John.
Look, he's dirty, but that's all I know.
All right, you find Lawrence, you'll get all the answers you need.
Okay, thanks.
Appreciate it.
Got it...
Lawrence.
That car's been here for a couple of days.
It's been out in front of the shop the whole time.
Whoa.
That is not a small amount of cocaine.
$12 million worth.
You can't give that dope back to Felix.
William, stay out of it.
- Come on, man, what are you, what are you doing?
- Felix is a businessman, all right?
Everything has a price.
This goes against everything we do.
Puts all that shit back on the street.
I'm gonna help the girl.
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Let us help you for once.
Take your own advice.
Focus on what you can control.
Don't save Anna.
Save your family.
Save yourself.
You did it before.
Do it again.
Tell her her father said good-bye.
I got something you want.
I'm at shoreline pier.
I'm all alone.
Well, hand it over.
I got no beef with you, William.
The kids had it coming.
If I didn't shoot John,
Felix would have.
It's all yours.
No!
There are four things that amaze me, even though now I finally think I've begun to understand them.
In fact, it's the very fact that I understand them that makes them so amazing.
The way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a ship at sea, the way of the serpent on a rock, and the way a man loves a woman.
And for me there's a fifth thing more amazing than the eagle, more inspiring than the ship, more potent than the serpent, and even more beautiful than the man and the woman.
It's the way of the family because without them, there's nothing worth loving.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Shh-shh-shh.
Don't scare the erection.
It's up, Violet.
Full mast.
- I thought you just wanted to be friends.
- I did.
But a week of friendship...
Looks like I'm over my issue.
[LAUGHS]
Is this okay ?
Oh, God.
This is embarrassing.
I shouldn't have come.
L...
[ELEVATOR DOOR SLIDING]
COOPER:
Hold it.
What's your problem ?
You look like someone died.
Dying.
- Big Daddy.
- Big Daddy ?
Well, that is a screen name.
When you get back on the horse, you really get back on the horse.
- Cooper.
- What's killing him ?
The sex or the cold-fish attitude ?
Big Daddy's my father.
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
- Hey.
- Hey.
So Kevin's back at my place.
That's good.
It's good.
- Yeah.
- I don't know, it's just weird.
It's all negotiation and awkwardness, but it's fine, it's fine.
Sam has a girlfriend.
Maya hung out with her last night at Sam's.
- That's not good.
- Oh, no, no, it's good.
- Oh.
Oh.
- No, no, no.
It's good, yeah.
Why do you two look like that ?
- We're good.
Yeah.
- We're good.
[SCOFFS]
- What ?
- Your girlfriend is nice.
Oh, thanks.
You have a girlfriend ?
- Well, that's...
- Good.
- That's good.
naomi:
It is really good.
Good morning.
I mean, who calls their father Big Daddy ?
I mean, it's like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.
It's like...
Charlotte King does.
- She actually calls her father Big Daddy ?
- Yes.
And, you know, he's dying, and I made a jerk of myself in front of Charlotte, because I was laughing.
- Nice move.
- Should I do something ?
VIOLET:
Yeah, walk away, Cooper.
Big Daddy's not your problem.
[BOY CRIES]
- Have another kid we don't know about ?
- Funny.
- This is Julian.
- It's the CF family's, Sam.
Champ, come here.
It is just wrong.
A single father, two kids, and all of them have cystic fibrosis.
And Julian's father doesn't sound so good.
ADDISON:
Hey, you two.
Is this photography day ?
DARON:
Yeah.
I got Gracie a camera for her birthday.
She's been taking pictures of everything.
[ADDISON CHUCKLES]
- Oh, sure.
- I'm making a scrapbook.
It's really great.
When I don't feel good, it gives me something to do.
Let's see if we can make you feel better.
Wanna be first ?
I'll keep your dad entertained with percussion.
- Where you beat me healthy ?
- Let Addison do the bronchoscopy lavage.
Great, we'll get your labs done, get you out of here.
- Gonna be okay on your own, kiddo ?
- Dad, I'm 9.
[CHUCKLES]
[COUGHING]
- All right, any dizziness, slurred speech ?
- No.
- Yes.
- Seth.
Will you please tell my son that I'm fine ?
You still have weakness in your right side, and a persistent visual-field defect.
I'm concerned.
- Tell her she needs to move.
- I'm not moving to Florida.
- I can take care of you there.
- I can take care of myself here.
Right ?
Well, you're still at risk for another stroke.
- You should be with someone.
- You ganging up on me ?
You know, since Dad died, you barely wanna talk on the phone.
- That's not true.
It's not true.
- It is.
He thinks I'm depressed.
I'm not.
I have friends.
I'm not alone.
Not family.
You should be with family.
This is a big decision.
Deciding to move, uproot your life, it's huge, but losing a spouse is huge too.
Do me a favor, Cynthia.
Speak with our therapist.
It would make me feel a lot more comfortable.
[SIGHS]
I thought I was okay with it, but I'm not sure if I am okay with it.
I'm sleeping with two men.
- Do I get a lecture now ?
- Yes.
Yes, you do.
This is good.
- This is progress.
- Really ?
- That's my lecture ?
- It's fun, it's exciting, it's...
Congratulations, man.
You're okay with it ?
Because the weird thing is I'm okay with it.
Except for the part of me that thinks I shouldn't be, but I think I am.
Sex is good.
Relationships are bad.
Relationships are what cause people to be cold and lying and deceitful.
- You're a therapist.
- Okay, professionally, I'd dispute that, and suggest you need to see your therapist, but personally, yes.
As a red-blooded American, sex is your birthright.
- Go forth, enjoy, guilt-free.
- I will.
I will exercise my right.
[DOOR OPENS]
Sorry to interrupt.
The CF results are back.
How bad ?
If this is serious, if I'm gonna die, please, just tell me now.
- Ahem.
- Daron, your test came back fine.
It's Gracie.
She tested positive for Burkholderia cepacia.
- It's a bacteria that gets in...
- Yeah, I know what it is.
- I'm sorry.
DARON:
No.
Gotta be some kind of mistake.
She looks fine.
Look at her.
You're not gonna tell me that her lung function is going downhill.
From her test results, it appears that it already has.
I mean, you know how contagious this bacteria can be for CF patients.
It's a miracle that you and Julian haven't caught it.
What we need to do now is get Gracie to the hospital, get her into isolation while we figure out what to do.
Okay.
All right, I'll take her there now.
No, Daron, you can't take her.
You can't touch her, you can't be with her, or you'll die.
I'm not being stubborn.
I don't want to move.
Moving to a new city at any age is stressful, but just for a minute, let's look at the other side.
Could this move be good for you ?
I can't move, and I can't talk to him about why I can't move.
And he's not going to take no for an answer,
[CRYING] And now he has Sam on his side.
Well, you can talk to me.
No.
If Seth finds out the truth, he's gonna hate me.
Cynthia, anything you tell me stays with me.
Let me help you.
Talk to me.
I can't even tell Sam.
If I can't come near you, how are you gonna take care of me ?
We'll figure something out, honey, okay ?
I promise.
But for right now, you're gonna have to go to the hospital with Dr. Freedman, okay ?
She needs me.
You can't put yourself at risk, or Julian.
If either of you gets exposed, this will kill you.
So I just leave her alone ?
Isn't there a family member you could call ?
Someone who could help you, could be with Gracie ?
I've got a sister in Nashville, but she doesn't really know Gracie.
Gracie needs me, okay ?
I need her.
She's already lost her mother.
You know ?
I'm all she has.
Look, I could wear a mask, right ?
You know, we could take precautions.
Daron, if you live together, you will get this, and there is no way we can treat it.
Well, I need to be there for both of them.
Yeah, they both need me.
How am I supposed to choose ?
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
- I'll be back.
- Okay, take care.
Hey, how's Gracie ?
Oh, you know, not good.
Trying to be brave, but she doesn't like the hospital.
I don't think she understands it.
Not seeing her dad or her brother, not living with them, that's permanent.
What were you talking to Charlotte about ?
Oh, she asked me to do her rounds while she goes to Alabama to see her dad.
What, like you owe her a favor after what she did to us ?
Cooper, her father is dying.
I'm sorry about your dad.
- If there's anything you need...
- I'm fine.
I see death every day on the job.
It's a part of life and I'll deal with it.
I'm late for my flight.
Cynthia is fully capable of making decisions about her own care.
You're not at all concerned that a 70-year-old woman still recovering from a stroke is putting herself further at risk by living alone ?
- Sam, you asked me to evaluate her.
- Yeah.
She's not depressed.
She is not clinging irrationally to her independence.
She has legitimate reasons for what she's doing.
- Which are ?
- Privileged.
[GROANS]
- Hey.
Um...
- Hey.
I think it's confusing to Maya, meeting a woman that you've just started to date.
- What ?
- A new girlfriend could be scary for her.
You have a problem with Sonya ?
No, no.
You date whoever you want.
Just think about how this affects Maya.
WOMAN [OVER P.A.]:
Dr. Milton, 2631.
- Oh !
- Whoa.
That was almost the highlight of my day.
Not in the mood.
Cute kid.
What ?
I can't feel for a patient ?
Try me.
Nine-year-old with cystic fibrosis, patient.
Rare bacterial infection in her lungs.
Father can't be with her anymore because he has CF too.
Same thing with her 2-year-old brother, because if either of them get infected with the bacteria, they'll die.
So father has to choose:
Let his girl die alone or stay with her and leave a 2-year-old with CF behind.
Burkholderia cepacia ?
What ?
I've had cancer patients manifest the same bacterial complications as those with B. Cepacia.
I've had success eradicating the infection.
Okay, no one in the world has found a cure for cepacia syndrome, but you're gonna pitch me one ?
I know cancer's a lot different than cystic fibrosis, and bacteria is more drug-resistant, I just...
It's a tragic story.
- Worth a shot.
- Why would you help me ?
I'm a doctor.
So I've spoken to your mother, Seth, and she is not ready to move.
- Mom...
- If you won't listen to me, listen to her.
She understands.
She has agreed to come in for weekly checkups with Sam and counseling with me, and to put a MedicAlert system in her house.
And if her condition worsens, then we can always revisit this.
I promised...
I promised Dad I would take care of you.
Most of my friends, the idea of a parent moving in is terrifying.
We want you.
- Seth.
- Not like I wanna put you in a home.
- Please, Seth, stop pushing me.
- Then help me understand.
You hate this city, you hate the traffic, the crime.
- Talk to me.
- Easy, Seth.
- I think I need a...
- Uh...
- Mom ?
- I got her legs.
VIOLET:
Get an ambulance, please.
Is she having another stroke ?
Is she having another stroke ?
SAM:
It was a transient ischemic attack.
Press.
A warning sign for a stroke.
It happened because I got upset.
That's all.
I am fine.
You're not a doctor.
Your doctors are saying you're not fine.
[DOOR OPENS]
Hey, I came as soon as I could.
- I'm fine.
Everyone is making a fuss.
- You're not fine.
Hi, Annette.
- Hey, Seth.
SETH:
Thank you.
Can you just wait outside ?
We're discussing things with the doctors.
She can stay.
I want someone on my side.
It's not about sides.
I'm sorry, I can't...
I'm moving you out.
I'll get a lawyer if I have to.
Talk to him.
Talk to your son.
He'll understand.
Violet, what's going on ?
She's right.
It's gotta be better than this.
[INHALES DEEPLY]
I'm not alone.
I have someone here who loves me and who wants to take care of me, and I was afraid to tell you because I love you too, and I'm afraid you won't understand.
Understand what ?
I have someone.
Your mother's in love.
She has someone here that she doesn't wanna leave and she was afraid to tell you.
I get that you've been alone.
I get that since Dad's been gone, it's confusing and you need to have somebody here with you.
This is not who you are.
This isn't a reaction to your father dying.
- I'm not talking to you.
- Seth.
- This is some grief-stricken reaction.
No, no, we've been together for years.
When you were with Dad ?
Yeah.
- I am so sorry.
- You cheated on Dad with her ?
Seth.
SAM:
Seth.
You wanna catch a movie after, just get away from it all ?
I can't.
CF research to do.
Wow, begins the day, ends the day.
I've got a little girl who's about to die, Kevin.
It's hard to think about going out and relaxing.
You could have called.
You could have said, "Don't come over."
- You wanted me to cancel ?
- You're giving me attitude.
- I'm here.
- There are other things I could be doing.
I get a lot of invitations.
My friends, women...
So, what, you wanna date other women ?
Maybe I do, but I don't.
I'm not, because this is so much fun.
[SIGHS]
What happened to us ?
I mean, there was a time when you'd eat noodles off of my naked body.
What ?
What happened to us ?
Look, I'm sorry.
I thought...
I usually think that honesty is for the best.
Hmm.
Well, I knew at 15, but back then, that was not what you did.
You found a guy, got married, had kids.
And I loved him.
I did.
And then I met Annette, and our kids were the same age, and she was...
I couldn't stop myself.
Well, you were honest with yourself.
That's sometimes the hardest piece.
He's got to understand, right ?
I mean, once he gets over the shock.
He loves you.
He wanted to do what was best for you.
He'll come around.
Electrons that detach and move around are called ?
- Atoms ?
- Free electrons.
Why are you being so nice to me ?
When's the last time you gave me answers without torturing me ?
I just know you didn't have a chance to study last night.
Okay.
What do you wanna know about her ?
- Sonya.
- Ha-ha.
I wasn't...
- How was last night ?
- It was fun.
It wasn't uncomfortable ?
Because, you know, you do not have to hang out with your dad and his new girlfriend.
I like her, Mom, and Dad really likes her.
You'd like her too, if you got to know her.
Don't worry about me.
Dad's just having fun.
You should have fun too.
You need to get a life.
- Pete.
- I can't stop thinking about you.
She loves Sonya.
And why shouldn't she ?
She's smart, she is pretty and she is fun.
She brings over movies and popcorn.
And I just...
I do homework.
Nai, you're her mom.
You're supposed to do homework, and Sonya is being fun because she's trying to make a good impression.
That's what happens when things are new.
You go out of your way to be nice.
Look at me and Kevin, you know ?
Not so new, not so nice anymore.
- That sounds like marriage.
- Ha.
You gonna end it ?
Hey.
I've been through all of Wyatt's research.
It's pretty convincing.
- Wyatt ?
- Yeah.
He had an idea to help.
Let's go find Pete and Coop.
So I could get her back ?
It's a long shot, Daron, but we'd like to try.
It's not gonna hurt ?
I don't wanna hurt her.
Her lungs are already full, so we have to clear them.
It's the same procedure.
We take a sample of the bacteria.
We know that it worked on cancer.
We are hoping, really hoping, it can help Gracie.
[SIGHS]
You know, she loves horses.
Her whole room is horses.
And I thought if she had these here in her room, that she'd feel more...
[SIGHS]
I don't know.
I'll go call her.
I'll tell her maybe.
Delivery for Miss Gracie Rousakis.
He's worried about me.
I don't like it when he worries.
- Well, he's your dad.
It's his job to worry.
- Tell him I'm fine.
- Gracie...
- Make him stop worrying about me.
Since Mom died, he's done everything.
But when he starts worrying, he starts coughing, and then...
You need to tell him I'm fine.
It's okay if you miss him.
I want my dad.
[SNIFFLING]
[SOBBING]
- We got your page.
- You've gotta give her something.
Seth hasn't come back or called.
She can't stop crying.
We'll prescribe lorazepam.
What you need to do is call Seth and get him back.
Tell him she'll go with him to Florida.
- No.
- I love you more than anything.
But you need your son and you need your grandchildren more than you need me.
Please, talk to him.
Tell him she'll go.
Just get him back here.
[SOBBING]
DELL:
Hey, I just want you to know that your dad's outside, waiting.
He wanted to let you know.
- What about Dr. Cooper ?
- He's gone for the day.
You don't have to worry.
I'm gonna take good care of you.
Once you're asleep, I'm gonna use this to clean out your lungs.
You'll feel much better.
See, who's that ?
Then we're gonna give Dell what we took out to give to Dr. Montgomery and Dr. Lockhart to test the antibiotics on.
I know it's scary, but when you wake up, it'll all be over.
I just...
I hope it works.
Now, we just need one of these to stay clear, and then we'll know that the bacteria is sensitive to that combination of antibiotics.
By morning, we should know, one way or the other.
- Wanna grab a bite ?
- Actually, I am starved, but I am supposed to meet someone.
- Ah.
The cop.
- Yes, the cop.
So you really think a hot date and fine dining is better than a guy you can barely stand and cafeteria mac and cheese ?
Well, I do love the mac and cheese.
From a psycho-physiological standpoint, this is remarkable.
- What is ?
- You.
What you do to me.
All day, I couldn't stop thinking about you.
And ever since you called...
[CHUCKLES]
- I remember this tasting a lot better.
- I don't know.
It takes me back to residency, you know, when life was simple.
See, I have a hard time picturing you taking crap from your attending.
- By year two, they all hated me.
- It took them that long ?
- Sorry.
- No, it's just...
Yeah, they really hated me.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- So did my wife.
- You're married ?
- Was.
And the divorce took two years, four lawyers, hundreds of thousands of dollars.
We discussed assets, property, money, the dog, but not once in all that time did anyone ever ask me about love.
I'm still bitter.
About the dog.
I get what bitter does.
You know, you have all that love, and then where does it go ?
- You too ?
- Member of the club.
So I'm gonna ask this again, but this time, pretend you think I'm human.
You wanna maybe have dinner with me sometime ?
- A date ?
- I don't think that's a good idea.
Is it because it's me or because of the cop ?
Think about it.
[DOOR OPENS, INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
ADDISON:
Oh.
- Nai ?
NAOMI [WHISPERING]:
Oh, God.
I am not here.
This is not jealousy.
This is concern for my daughter.
Nai, remember when Maya told you...
Remember when Maya told you to get a life ?
I have a life.
I have a great life.
I'm just standing here on my patio, in the dark, spying on your ex, his girlfriend and your daughter.
[SIGHS]
- I'm being replaced.
- Oh.
Sonya is my replacement.
That's Maya's new mommy.
Shh.
Oh, I'm freaking.
Oh, God.
Ignore me, ignore me.
I'm just freaking out.
Thank you.
Why aren't you out with Kevin ?
[CHUCKLES]
It's not like we're married, Naomi.
I don't have to be with him every night.
I don't have to call or check in.
And if I wanna talk to another man, it's not like we have promise rings or anything.
Who is it ?
- This other man.
- Oh, no...
[SIGHS]
Wyatt asked me out on a date.
Oh.
He's different than I thought.
Okay, well, can I just say that you're in a relationship, so, you know, knees together.
No, I'm not a cheater.
Okay, I've done that.
I'm not gonna do that again.
You know, but I do wanna say yes to the date.
I just...
I don't know.
Should I ?
I shouldn't.
- Should I ?
- Oh, God, we are so screwed up.
[SIGHS] Oh.
This is a nice place.
Crazy humid.
Hi.
[AIR HISSING]
Lung cancer.
Doctors gave him six months.
Two years ago.
He went into respiratory failure last week.
How you holding up ?
Well, let's see.
Duke and Landry are downing bourbon.
Mama's taken to her room with the vapors.
And not a one of them wants any part of making a decision about Big Daddy.
The vapors ?
You have a medical degree.
You diagnosed your mother with the vapors.
She's a drug addict, Cooper.
Here in Dixie, we're more polite about it.
[SIGHS]
- What ?
- Why are you here, Cooper ?
In the middle of my Southern Gothic tragedy.
I came for you.
Landry was supposed to pull the plug this morning.
Couldn't do it.
Duke can't even come in the room.
So it's just you.
Just me.
Not even there anymore.
It's just the ethical, moral, medically correct thing to do.
Pull the plug, and it's done.
- Are you okay ?
- No.
Not really.
So I've been having sex.
- Lots and lots and lots of sex.
- Yes, with Pete.
And with Sheldon.
Many times.
Many, many, many times.
[WHISPERING] And I'm in pain.
And I can't stop peeing.
You need Addison.
You've got honeymoon cystitis from too much sex, so I will prescribe you an antibiotic and something for the pain.
Violet Turner, I am your friend and I know you.
Sleeping with Sheldon and Pete is not you.
Oh, come on.
When Cooper does it, he gets a slap on the back and an "attaboy."
But when I do it, when a woman takes control of her sexuality, she's a whore.
You are just not that person.
Something is going on here.
I mean, I don't know, you're avoiding something or in denial or something psychological.
I don't know.
You're the therapist, you know, and you know that this is not good.
Wouldn't it be better just to figure out which one you wanna be with ?
How can I choose ?
I mean, Pete is...
Pete's all heat.
I just see him, and I melt.
- And Sheldon is comfort.
- Like mac and cheese.
What ?
Do you think this is okay ?
What she's doing ?
I think that it's hard to figure out who the right person is.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I mean, Kevin's great.
But, you know, I mean, is he the one or is it someone else ?
I wanna be okay with Sonya, I do, but I don't think I care that Sam is dating.
But do I care ?
Am I in denial ?
No, no, this is about Maya, right ?
I'm not crazy, this is about Maya.
I'm not crazy.
Does this really look like the time for therapy ?
[GROANS]
[KNOCKS, OPENS DOOR]
Oh, hey, thanks for coming in.
Look, I just came to pick up my laptop.
I left it yesterday when I ran out.
Your mother needs you.
She is willing to move all the way to Florida if that's what you want.
Think about it, Seth.
Think about what's best for her.
Only thing I've been able to think about is how stupid I was not to figure this out.
Well, she wanted to tell you.
- She was afraid you wouldn't accept her.
- It's not about accepting her.
You think I can't accept that she's gay ?
I've known Annette my whole life.
Now it's like I'm replaying every moment, every Christmas, every Thanksgiving.
You know, I was in the backyard playing football, and they were, hah, fooling around.
- You don't know that.
- Think I wanna think about it ?
And my dad ?
She was everything to him.
She betrayed him.
She betrayed us.
SAM:
You're a father.
You've gotta know how difficult it is to be a parent.
You love your kids, so you wanna do everything you can to protect them.
So you try to figure out what's right to tell them and what's right to keep from them, and sometimes you don't get it right, but, you know, you do your best, because you love them.
Think it would have been better if your mother had left your father when you were a kid ?
She was just trying to keep the family together.
Trying to give you the mother that you wanted.
I don't know her.
I feel no connection to that woman, because I don't know her at all.
She is your mother, Seth.
She would give up everything for you.
Don't you think she has given up enough ?
I'm almost afraid to come in here.
We just need one dish without bacterial growth.
You make it sound so simple.
[ADDISON SIGHS]
[SIGHS]
So that's what it looks like inside of her lungs ?
It was a long shot.
You had to try.
We had to try.
- Addison...
- I don't think we should have dinner.
Why ?
Why, because of me or because the miracle didn't work ?
I don't know.
Hi.
Sam just left for Saint Ambrose if you're looking for him.
Oh, thank you.
- Heh.
- I guess patient trumps lunch.
Look, we didn't really get a chance to talk the other night.
- And I just wanted to...
- No.
Look, you don't have to.
It's me who should say something.
It must have been weird, seeing me hanging out with your daughter.
I remember what it was like when my mom dated.
Oh, no, no, no, it's fine.
Well, you know, I just want you to know that wherever this is heading with Sam,
I wanna be really careful about Maya's feelings.
I got burned a few times, so I get it.
Well, thank you.
That's very...
Thank you.
You're very nice.
Well, so are you.
[AIR HISSING, MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY]
Big Daddy always said cancer was just his chickens coming home to roost.
See, he didn't believe in tears.
If he ever cried, he did it in private.
Cancer was just his chickens.
[CHUCKLES]
Payback for being a son of a bitch.
And he was a son of a bitch to everybody.
Everybody but me.
He loved me being a doctor.
He loved that I didn't just marry some boy and have a bunch of babies.
He would've killed me for marrying a son of a bitch of my own, because he knew what that would have been like for me.
But if I'd have stayed, married some boy and had babies,
I would have been here when he got sick.
I would have been here to take care of him.
So these aren't his chickens.
These are my chickens.
Because now I'm the doctor in the family, and I know what has to be done.
- Charlotte.
- I can do this.
Shut up.
I can do this.
I can do this, damn it.
- I can do this.
- Okay.
Okay.
[MOANS SOFTLY]
[EKG FLATLINING]
That's that.
It's okay to cry.
No.
It's not.
[COUGHS]
Daron, I'm sorry.
Nothing ?
Well, we knew it was a long shot, but I'm sorry.
I can't even go in there to tell her.
I'll do it.
[DOOR OPENS]
[DOOR CLOSES]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
[GASPS]
I can't.
- Gracie.
- I want my dad.
Pete's gonna handle this.
He'll take care of her.
I can't do it.
I can't...
[CRYING]
Here.
Here are the keys to my house.
All Julian's clothes and his toys are in his room.
Okay, just...
[JULIAN CRYING]
Just make sure that he knows why I did this.
- No.
- And that they take care of him.
[SOBBING]
- No, Daron.
- You can't do this.
I will not let my daughter go through that alone.
Daron, if you go in there...
I love my son...
[SNIFFLES] ...but I love my daughter.
[CRYING]
Daron.
[JULIAN CRYING LOUDLY]
JULIAN:
Mommy.
He's not coming.
- I can try to talk to him again.
- Maybe he just needs more time.
It's my fault.
I tried to keep it separate.
Who I was, who I loved.
You are who you are, and you shouldn't have to hide that from anybody.
I love you.
[SNIFFLES]
I made it all the way out, but I couldn't get out of the car.
I just sat there for an hour in the rental-car return lane.
I'm still trying to understand this.
I know you took care of us.
Dad was happy.
I was happy.
I guess it's your turn to be happy.
So you should stay here with Annette.
I'll...
I'll visit.
Maybe sometime we'll visit.
I'd like that.
Daron gave up on his son.
He just walked away from him.
Well, it was an impossible choice to make.
It's hard to fault him.
The reality of Gracie dying was right in front of him.
The idea of Julian having to bury him or not be with him, it's just too abstract.
I just wanted to...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey, Pete.
- Sheldon.
- I didn't mean to interrupt a conference.
I just wanted to know if you wanted to come over later and...
You're going over to his house ?
- Pete.
- I'm sorry, is there a ?
Oh.
Oh.
Okay, look, Pete, Sheldon, I'm sleeping with both of you.
I thought it was okay, but it's not.
I realize that you just can't do that.
I can't do that, and...
And I'm sorry.
Who are you ?
He's right.
I'm a mess.
[SIGHS]
We're all a mess.
Don't you know that by now ?
[CHUCKLES]
All I know is, I don't mind finding out who you are.
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
Oh, hey.
I was just coming to see you.
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.
I just wanted to say that I feel I have a responsibility to our daughter.
For her to know who I am, good or bad.
Even if that means telling her who I'm dating.
I never want her to not know who I am.
Now, I'm gonna say this, and I know how it sounds.
- Maya likes her better than me.
- She's your daughter, Nai.
You are her mother.
She doesn't like Sonya better.
Sonya's just new.
[INAUDIBLE]
I don't know what I'm doing here.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Shh-shh-shh.
Don't scare the erection.
It's up, Violet.
Full mast.
- I thought you just wanted to be friends.
- I did.
But a week of friendship...
Looks like I'm over my issue.
[LAUGHS]
Is this okay?
Oh, God.
This is embarrassing.
I shouldn't have come.
L...
[ELEVATOR DOOR SLIDING]
COOPER:
Hold it.
What's your problem?
You look like someone died.
Dying.
- Big Daddy.
- Big Daddy?
Well, that is a screen name.
When you get back on the horse, you really get back on the horse.
- Cooper.
- What's killing him?
The sex or the cold-fish attitude?
Big Daddy's my father.
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
- Hey.
- Hey.
So Kevin's back at my place.
That's good.
It's good.
- Yeah.
- I don't know, it's just weird.
It's all negotiation and awkwardness, but it's fine, it's fine.
Sam has a girlfriend.
Maya hung out with her last night at Sam's.
- That's not good.
- Oh, no, no, it's good.
- Oh.
Oh.
- No, no, no.
It's good, yeah.
Why do you two look like that?
- We're good.
Yeah.
- We're good.
[SCOFFS]
- What?
- Your girlfriend is nice.
Oh, thanks.
You have a girlfriend?
- Well, that's...
- Good.
- That's good.
naomi:
It is really good.
Good morning.
I mean, who calls their father Big Daddy?
I mean, it's like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.
It's like...
Charlotte King does.
- She actually calls her father Big Daddy?
- Yes.
And, you know, he's dying, and I made a jerk of myself in front of Charlotte, because I was laughing.
- Nice move.
- Should I do something?
VIOLET:
Yeah, walk away, Cooper.
Big Daddy's not your problem.
[BOY CRIES]
- Have another kid we don't know about?
- Funny.
- This is Julian.
- It's the CF family's, Sam.
Champ, come here.
It is just wrong.
A single father, two kids, and all of them have cystic fibrosis.
And Julian's father doesn't sound so good.
ADDISON:
Hey, you two.
Is this photography day?
DARON:
Yeah.
I got Gracie a camera for her birthday.
She's been taking pictures of everything.
[ADDISON CHUCKLES]
- Oh, sure.
- I'm making a scrapbook.
It's really great.
When I don't feel good, it gives me something to do.
Let's see if we can make you feel better.
Wanna be first?
I'll keep your dad entertained with percussion.
- Where you beat me healthy?
- Let Addison do the bronchoscopy lavage.
Great, we'll get your labs done, get you out of here.
- Gonna be okay on your own, kiddo?
- Dad, I'm 9.
[CHUCKLES]
[COUGHING]
- All right, any dizziness, slurred speech?
- No.
- Yes.
- Seth.
Will you please tell my son that I'm fine?
You still have weakness in your right side, and a persistent visual-field defect.
I'm concerned.
- Tell her she needs to move.
- I'm not moving to Florida.
- I can take care of you there.
- I can take care of myself here.
Right?
Well, you're still at risk for another stroke.
- You should be with someone.
- You ganging up on me?
You know, since Dad died, you barely wanna talk on the phone.
- That's not true.
It's not true.
- It is.
He thinks I'm depressed.
I'm not.
I have friends.
I'm not alone.
Not family.
You should be with family.
This is a big decision.
Deciding to move, uproot your life, it's huge, but losing a spouse is huge too.
Do me a favor, Cynthia.
Speak with our therapist.
It would make me feel a lot more comfortable.
[SIGHS]
I thought I was okay with it, but I'm not sure if I am okay with it.
I'm sleeping with two men.
- Do I get a lecture now?
- Yes.
Yes, you do.
This is good.
- This is progress.
- Really?
- That's my lecture?
- It's fun, it's exciting, it's...
Congratulations, man.
You're okay with it?
Because the weird thing is I'm okay with it.
Except for the part of me that thinks I shouldn't be, but I think I am.
Sex is good.
Relationships are bad.
Relationships are what cause people to be cold and lying and deceitful.
- You're a therapist.
- Okay, professionally, I'd dispute that, and suggest you need to see your therapist, but personally, yes.
As a red-blooded American, sex is your birthright.
- Go forth, enjoy, guilt-free.
- I will.
I will exercise my right.
[DOOR OPENS]
Sorry to interrupt.
The CF results are back.
How bad?
If this is serious, if I'm gonna die, please, just tell me now.
- Ahem.
- Daron, your test came back fine.
It's Gracie.
She tested positive for Burkholderia cepacia.
- It's a bacteria that gets in...
- Yeah, I know what it is.
- I'm sorry.
DARON:
No.
Gotta be some kind of mistake.
She looks fine.
Look at her.
You're not gonna tell me that her lung function is going downhill.
From her test results, it appears that it already has.
I mean, you know how contagious this bacteria can be for CF patients.
It's a miracle that you and Julian haven't caught it.
What we need to do now is get Gracie to the hospital, get her into isolation while we figure out what to do.
Okay.
All right, I'll take her there now.
No, Daron, you can't take her.
You can't touch her, you can't be with her, or you'll die.
I'm not being stubborn.
I don't want to move.
Moving to a new city at any age is stressful, but just for a minute, let's look at the other side.
Could this move be good for you?
I can't move, and I can't talk to him about why I can't move.
And he's not going to take no for an answer,
[CRYING] And now he has Sam on his side.
Well, you can talk to me.
No.
If Seth finds out the truth, he's gonna hate me.
Cynthia, anything you tell me stays with me.
Let me help you.
Talk to me.
I can't even tell Sam.
If I can't come near you, how are you gonna take care of me?
We'll figure something out, honey, okay?
I promise.
But for right now, you're gonna have to go to the hospital with Dr. Freedman, okay?
She needs me.
You can't put yourself at risk, or Julian.
If either of you gets exposed, this will kill you.
So I just leave her alone?
Isn't there a family member you could call?
Someone who could help you, could be with Gracie?
I've got a sister in Nashville, but she doesn't really know Gracie.
Gracie needs me, okay?
I need her.
She's already lost her mother.
You know?
I'm all she has.
Look, I could wear a mask, right?
You know, we could take precautions.
Daron, if you live together, you will get this, and there is no way we can treat it.
Well, I need to be there for both of them.
Yeah, they both need me.
How am I supposed to choose?
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
- I'll be back.
- Okay, take care.
Hey, how's Gracie?
Oh, you know, not good.
Trying to be brave, but she doesn't like the hospital.
I don't think she understands it.
Not seeing her dad or her brother, not living with them, that's permanent.
What were you talking to Charlotte about?
Oh, she asked me to do her rounds while she goes to Alabama to see her dad.
What, like you owe her a favor after what she did to us?
Cooper, her father is dying.
I'm sorry about your dad.
- If there's anything you need...
- I'm fine.
I see death every day on the job.
It's a part of life and I'll deal with it.
I'm late for my flight.
Cynthia is fully capable of making decisions about her own care.
You're not at all concerned that a 70-year-old woman still recovering from a stroke is putting herself further at risk by living alone?
- Sam, you asked me to evaluate her.
- Yeah.
She's not depressed.
She is not clinging irrationally to her independence.
She has legitimate reasons for what she's doing.
- Which are?
- Privileged.
[GROANS]
- Hey.
Um...
- Hey.
I think it's confusing to Maya, meeting a woman that you've just started to date.
- What?
- A new girlfriend could be scary for her.
You have a problem with Sonya?
No, no.
You date whoever you want.
Just think about how this affects Maya.
WOMAN [OVER P.A.]:
Dr. Milton, 2631.
- Oh!
- Whoa.
That was almost the highlight of my day.
Not in the mood.
Cute kid.
What?
I can't feel for a patient?
Try me.
Nine-year-old with cystic fibrosis, patient.
Rare bacterial infection in her lungs.
Father can't be with her anymore because he has CF too.
Same thing with her 2-year-old brother, because if either of them get infected with the bacteria, they'll die.
So father has to choose:
Let his girl die alone or stay with her and leave a 2-year-old with CF behind.
Burkholderia cepacia?
What?
I've had cancer patients manifest the same bacterial complications as those with B. Cepacia.
I've had success eradicating the infection.
Okay, no one in the world has found a cure for cepacia syndrome, but you're gonna pitch me one?
I know cancer's a lot different than cystic fibrosis, and bacteria is more drug-resistant, I just...
It's a tragic story.
- Worth a shot.
- Why would you help me?
I'm a doctor.
So I've spoken to your mother, Seth, and she is not ready to move.
- Mom...
- If you won't listen to me, listen to her.
She understands.
She has agreed to come in for weekly checkups with Sam and counseling with me, and to put a MedicAlert system in her house.
And if her condition worsens, then we can always revisit this.
I promised...
I promised Dad I would take care of you.
Most of my friends, the idea of a parent moving in is terrifying.
We want you.
- Seth.
- Not like I wanna put you in a home.
- Please, Seth, stop pushing me.
- Then help me understand.
You hate this city, you hate the traffic, the crime.
- Talk to me.
- Easy, Seth.
- I think I need a...
- Uh...
- Mom?
- I got her legs.
VIOLET:
Get an ambulance, please.
Is she having another stroke?
Is she having another stroke?
SAM:
It was a transient ischemic attack.
Press.
A warning sign for a stroke.
It happened because I got upset.
That's all.
I am fine.
You're not a doctor.
Your doctors are saying you're not fine.
[DOOR OPENS]
Hey, I came as soon as I could.
- I'm fine.
Everyone is making a fuss.
- You're not fine.
Hi, Annette.
- Hey, Seth.
SETH:
Thank you.
Can you just wait outside?
We're discussing things with the doctors.
She can stay.
I want someone on my side.
It's not about sides.
I'm sorry, I can't...
I'm moving you out.
I'll get a lawyer if I have to.
Talk to him.
Talk to your son.
He'll understand.
Violet, what's going on?
She's right.
It's gotta be better than this.
[INHALES DEEPLY]
I'm not alone.
I have someone here who loves me and who wants to take care of me, and I was afraid to tell you because I love you too, and I'm afraid you won't understand.
Understand what?
I have someone.
Your mother's in love.
She has someone here that she doesn't wanna leave and she was afraid to tell you.
I get that you've been alone.
I get that since Dad's been gone, it's confusing and you need to have somebody here with you.
This is not who you are.
This isn't a reaction to your father dying.
- I'm not talking to you.
- Seth.
- This is some grief-stricken reaction.
No, no, we've been together for years.
When you were with Dad?
Yeah.
- I am so sorry.
- You cheated on Dad with her?
Seth.
SAM:
Seth.
You wanna catch a movie after, just get away from it all?
I can't.
CF research to do.
Wow, begins the day, ends the day.
I've got a little girl who's about to die, Kevin.
It's hard to think about going out and relaxing.
You could have called.
You could have said, "Don't come over."
- You wanted me to cancel?
- You're giving me attitude.
- I'm here.
- There are other things I could be doing.
I get a lot of invitations.
My friends, women...
So, what, you wanna date other women?
Maybe I do, but I don't.
I'm not, because this is so much fun.
[SIGHS]
What happened to us?
I mean, there was a time when you'd eat noodles off of my naked body.
What?
What happened to us?
Look, I'm sorry.
I thought...
I usually think that honesty is for the best.
Hmm.
Well, I knew at 15, but back then, that was not what you did.
You found a guy, got married, had kids.
And I loved him.
I did.
And then I met Annette, and our kids were the same age, and she was...
I couldn't stop myself.
Well, you were honest with yourself.
That's sometimes the hardest piece.
He's got to understand, right?
I mean, once he gets over the shock.
He loves you.
He wanted to do what was best for you.
He'll come around.
Electrons that detach and move around are called?
- Atoms?
- Free electrons.
Why are you being so nice to me?
When's the last time you gave me answers without torturing me?
I just know you didn't have a chance to study last night.
Okay.
What do you wanna know about her?
- Sonya.
- Ha-ha.
I wasn't...
- How was last night?
- It was fun.
It wasn't uncomfortable?
Because, you know, you do not have to hang out with your dad and his new girlfriend.
I like her, Mom, and Dad really likes her.
You'd like her too, if you got to know her.
Don't worry about me.
Dad's just having fun.
You should have fun too.
You need to get a life.
- Pete.
- I can't stop thinking about you.
She loves Sonya.
And why shouldn't she?
She's smart, she is pretty and she is fun.
She brings over movies and popcorn.
And I just...
I do homework.
Nai, you're her mom.
You're supposed to do homework, and Sonya is being fun because she's trying to make a good impression.
That's what happens when things are new.
You go out of your way to be nice.
Look at me and Kevin, you know?
Not so new, not so nice anymore.
- That sounds like marriage.
- Ha.
You gonna end it?
Hey.
I've been through all of Wyatt's research.
It's pretty convincing.
- Wyatt?
- Yeah.
He had an idea to help.
Let's go find Pete and Coop.
So I could get her back?
It's a long shot, Daron, but we'd like to try.
It's not gonna hurt?
I don't wanna hurt her.
Her lungs are already full, so we have to clear them.
It's the same procedure.
We take a sample of the bacteria.
We know that it worked on cancer.
We are hoping, really hoping, it can help Gracie.
[SIGHS]
You know, she loves horses.
Her whole room is horses.
And I thought if she had these here in her room, that she'd feel more...
[SIGHS]
I don't know.
I'll go call her.
I'll tell her maybe.
Delivery for Miss Gracie Rousakis.
He's worried about me.
I don't like it when he worries.
- Well, he's your dad.
It's his job to worry.
- Tell him I'm fine.
- Gracie...
- Make him stop worrying about me.
Since Mom died, he's done everything.
But when he starts worrying, he starts coughing, and then...
You need to tell him I'm fine.
It's okay if you miss him.
I want my dad.
[SNIFFLING]
[SOBBING]
- We got your page.
- You've gotta give her something.
Seth hasn't come back or called.
She can't stop crying.
We'll prescribe lorazepam.
What you need to do is call Seth and get him back.
Tell him she'll go with him to Florida.
- No.
- I love you more than anything.
But you need your son and you need your grandchildren more than you need me.
Please, talk to him.
Tell him she'll go.
Just get him back here.
[SOBBING]
DELL:
Hey, I just want you to know that your dad's outside, waiting.
He wanted to let you know.
- What about Dr. Cooper?
- He's gone for the day.
You don't have to worry.
I'm gonna take good care of you.
Once you're asleep, I'm gonna use this to clean out your lungs.
You'll feel much better.
See, who's that?
Then we're gonna give Dell what we took out to give to Dr. Montgomery and Dr. Lockhart to test the antibiotics on.
I know it's scary, but when you wake up, it'll all be over.
I just...
I hope it works.
Now, we just need one of these to stay clear, and then we'll know that the bacteria is sensitive to that combination of antibiotics.
By morning, we should know, one way or the other.
- Wanna grab a bite?
- Actually, I am starved, but I am supposed to meet someone.
- Ah.
The cop.
- Yes, the cop.
So you really think a hot date and fine dining is better than a guy you can barely stand and cafeteria mac and cheese?
Well, I do love the mac and cheese.
From a psycho-physiological standpoint, this is remarkable.
- What is?
- You.
What you do to me.
All day, I couldn't stop thinking about you.
And ever since you called...
[CHUCKLES]
- I remember this tasting a lot better.
- I don't know.
It takes me back to residency, you know, when life was simple.
See, I have a hard time picturing you taking crap from your attending.
- By year two, they all hated me.
- It took them that long?
- Sorry.
- No, it's just...
Yeah, they really hated me.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- So did my wife.
- You're married?
- Was.
And the divorce took two years, four lawyers, hundreds of thousands of dollars.
We discussed assets, property, money, the dog, but not once in all that time did anyone ever ask me about love.
I'm still bitter.
About the dog.
I get what bitter does.
You know, you have all that love, and then where does it go?
- You too?
- Member of the club.
So I'm gonna ask this again, but this time, pretend you think I'm human.
You wanna maybe have dinner with me sometime?
- A date?
- I don't think that's a good idea.
Is it because it's me or because of the cop?
Think about it.
[DOOR OPENS, INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
ADDISON:
Oh.
- Nai?
NAOMI [WHISPERING]:
Oh, God.
I am not here.
This is not jealousy.
This is concern for my daughter.
Nai, remember when Maya told you...
Remember when Maya told you to get a life?
I have a life.
I have a great life.
I'm just standing here on my patio, in the dark, spying on your ex, his girlfriend and your daughter.
[SIGHS]
- I'm being replaced.
- Oh.
Sonya is my replacement.
That's Maya's new mommy.
Shh.
Oh, I'm freaking.
Oh, God.
Ignore me, ignore me.
I'm just freaking out.
Thank you.
Why aren't you out with Kevin?
[CHUCKLES]
It's not like we're married, Naomi.
I don't have to be with him every night.
I don't have to call or check in.
And if I wanna talk to another man, it's not like we have promise rings or anything.
Who is it?
- This other man.
- Oh, no...
[SIGHS]
Wyatt asked me out on a date.
Oh.
He's different than I thought.
Okay, well, can I just say that you're in a relationship, so, you know, knees together.
No, I'm not a cheater.
Okay, I've done that.
I'm not gonna do that again.
You know, but I do wanna say yes to the date.
I just...
I don't know.
Should I?
I shouldn't.
- Should I?
- Oh, God, we are so screwed up.
[SIGHS] Oh.
This is a nice place.
Crazy humid.
Hi.
[AIR HISSING]
Lung cancer.
Doctors gave him six months.
Two years ago.
He went into respiratory failure last week.
How you holding up?
Well, let's see.
Duke and Landry are downing bourbon.
Mama's taken to her room with the vapors.
And not a one of them wants any part of making a decision about Big Daddy.
The vapors?
You have a medical degree.
You diagnosed your mother with the vapors.
She's a drug addict, Cooper.
Here in Dixie, we're more polite about it.
[SIGHS]
- What?
- Why are you here, Cooper?
In the middle of my Southern Gothic tragedy.
I came for you.
Landry was supposed to pull the plug this morning.
Couldn't do it.
Duke can't even come in the room.
So it's just you.
Just me.
Not even there anymore.
It's just the ethical, moral, medically correct thing to do.
Pull the plug, and it's done.
- Are you okay?
- No.
Not really.
So I've been having sex.
- Lots and lots and lots of sex.
- Yes, with Pete.
And with Sheldon.
Many times.
Many, many, many times.
[WHISPERING] And I'm in pain.
And I can't stop peeing.
You need Addison.
You've got honeymoon cystitis from too much sex, so I will prescribe you an antibiotic and something for the pain.
Violet Turner, I am your friend and I know you.
Sleeping with Sheldon and Pete is not you.
Oh, come on.
When Cooper does it, he gets a slap on the back and an "attaboy."
But when I do it, when a woman takes control of her sexuality, she's a whore.
You are just not that person.
Something is going on here.
I mean, I don't know, you're avoiding something or in denial or something psychological.
I don't know.
You're the therapist, you know, and you know that this is not good.
Wouldn't it be better just to figure out which one you wanna be with?
How can I choose?
I mean, Pete is...
Pete's all heat.
I just see him, and I melt.
- And Sheldon is comfort.
- Like mac and cheese.
What?
Do you think this is okay?
What she's doing?
I think that it's hard to figure out who the right person is.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I mean, Kevin's great.
But, you know, I mean, is he the one or is it someone else?
I wanna be okay with Sonya, I do, but I don't think I care that Sam is dating.
But do I care?
Am I in denial?
No, no, this is about Maya, right?
I'm not crazy, this is about Maya.
I'm not crazy.
Does this really look like the time for therapy?
[GROANS]
[KNOCKS, OPENS DOOR]
Oh, hey, thanks for coming in.
Look, I just came to pick up my laptop.
I left it yesterday when I ran out.
Your mother needs you.
She is willing to move all the way to Florida if that's what you want.
Think about it, Seth.
Think about what's best for her.
Only thing I've been able to think about is how stupid I was not to figure this out.
Well, she wanted to tell you.
- She was afraid you wouldn't accept her.
- It's not about accepting her.
You think I can't accept that she's gay?
I've known Annette my whole life.
Now it's like I'm replaying every moment, every Christmas, every Thanksgiving.
You know, I was in the backyard playing football, and they were, hah, fooling around.
- You don't know that.
- Think I wanna think about it?
And my dad?
She was everything to him.
She betrayed him.
She betrayed us.
SAM:
You're a father.
You've gotta know how difficult it is to be a parent.
You love your kids, so you wanna do everything you can to protect them.
So you try to figure out what's right to tell them and what's right to keep from them, and sometimes you don't get it right, but, you know, you do your best, because you love them.
Think it would have been better if your mother had left your father when you were a kid?
She was just trying to keep the family together.
Trying to give you the mother that you wanted.
I don't know her.
I feel no connection to that woman, because I don't know her at all.
She is your mother, Seth.
She would give up everything for you.
Don't you think she has given up enough?
I'm almost afraid to come in here.
We just need one dish without bacterial growth.
You make it sound so simple.
[ADDISON SIGHS]
[SIGHS]
So that's what it looks like inside of her lungs?
It was a long shot.
You had to try.
We had to try.
- Addison...
- I don't think we should have dinner.
Why?
Why, because of me or because the miracle didn't work?
I don't know.
Hi.
Sam just left for Saint Ambrose if you're looking for him.
Oh, thank you.
- Heh.
- I guess patient trumps lunch.
Look, we didn't really get a chance to talk the other night.
- And I just wanted to...
- No.
Look, you don't have to.
It's me who should say something.
It must have been weird, seeing me hanging out with your daughter.
I remember what it was like when my mom dated.
Oh, no, no, no, it's fine.
Well, you know, I just want you to know that wherever this is heading with Sam,
I wanna be really careful about Maya's feelings.
I got burned a few times, so I get it.
Well, thank you.
That's very...
Thank you.
You're very nice.
Well, so are you.
[AIR HISSING, MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY]
Big Daddy always said cancer was just his chickens coming home to roost.
See, he didn't believe in tears.
If he ever cried, he did it in private.
Cancer was just his chickens.
[CHUCKLES]
Payback for being a son of a bitch.
And he was a son of a bitch to everybody.
Everybody but me.
He loved me being a doctor.
He loved that I didn't just marry some boy and have a bunch of babies.
He would've killed me for marrying a son of a bitch of my own, because he knew what that would have been like for me.
But if I'd have stayed, married some boy and had babies,
I would have been here when he got sick.
I would have been here to take care of him.
So these aren't his chickens.
These are my chickens.
Because now I'm the doctor in the family, and I know what has to be done.
- Charlotte.
- I can do this.
Shut up.
I can do this.
I can do this, damn it.
- I can do this.
- Okay.
Okay.
[MOANS SOFTLY]
[EKG FLATLINING]
That's that.
It's okay to cry.
No.
It's not.
[COUGHS]
Daron, I'm sorry.
Nothing?
Well, we knew it was a long shot, but I'm sorry.
I can't even go in there to tell her.
I'll do it.
[DOOR OPENS]
[DOOR CLOSES]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
[GASPS]
I can't.
- Gracie.
- I want my dad.
Pete's gonna handle this.
He'll take care of her.
I can't do it.
I can't...
[CRYING]
Here.
Here are the keys to my house.
All Julian's clothes and his toys are in his room.
Okay, just...
[JULIAN CRYING]
Just make sure that he knows why I did this.
- No.
- And that they take care of him.
[SOBBING]
- No, Daron.
- You can't do this.
I will not let my daughter go through that alone.
Daron, if you go in there...
I love my son...
[SNIFFLES] ...but I love my daughter.
[CRYING]
Daron.
[JULIAN CRYING LOUDLY]
JULIAN:
Mommy.
He's not coming.
- I can try to talk to him again.
- Maybe he just needs more time.
It's my fault.
I tried to keep it separate.
Who I was, who I loved.
You are who you are, and you shouldn't have to hide that from anybody.
I love you.
[SNIFFLES]
I made it all the way out, but I couldn't get out of the car.
I just sat there for an hour in the rental-car return lane.
I'm still trying to understand this.
I know you took care of us.
Dad was happy.
I was happy.
I guess it's your turn to be happy.
So you should stay here with Annette.
I'll...
I'll visit.
Maybe sometime we'll visit.
I'd like that.
Daron gave up on his son.
He just walked away from him.
Well, it was an impossible choice to make.
It's hard to fault him.
The reality of Gracie dying was right in front of him.
The idea of Julian having to bury him or not be with him, it's just too abstract.
I just wanted to...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey, Pete.
- Sheldon.
- I didn't mean to interrupt a conference.
I just wanted to know if you wanted to come over later and...
You're going over to his house?
- Pete.
- I'm sorry, is there a?
Oh.
Oh.
Okay, look, Pete, Sheldon, I'm sleeping with both of you.
I thought it was okay, but it's not.
I realize that you just can't do that.
I can't do that, and...
And I'm sorry.
Who are you?
He's right.
I'm a mess.
[SIGHS]
We're all a mess.
Don't you know that by now?
[CHUCKLES]
All I know is, I don't mind finding out who you are.
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
Oh, hey.
I was just coming to see you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I just wanted to say that I feel I have a responsibility to our daughter.
For her to know who I am, good or bad.
Even if that means telling her who I'm dating.
I never want her to not know who I am.
Now, I'm gonna say this, and I know how it sounds.
- Maya likes her better than me.
- She's your daughter, Nai.
You are her mother.
She doesn't like Sonya better.
Sonya's just new.
[INAUDIBLE]
I don't know what I'm doing here.
sheldon.
Don't scare the erection.
It's up,violet.
Full mast.
I...
I thoughtyou just wanted to be friends.
I did,but a week of friendship... it looks like I'm overmy issue,so... is--is this okay?
Oh,god.
This is embarrassing.
I-I-I shouldn't have come.
hold it!
What's your problem?
You look like someone died.
Dying.
Big daddy.
Big daddy?
Well,that is a screen name.
When you get backon the horse,you really get backon the horse,huh?
-Cooper-- -what's killing him,the--the sexor the cold-fish attitude?
Big daddy's my father.
So,uh... kevin's backat my place.
That's good.
That's good.
-I don't know.
-It's just weird.
It's all negotiationand awkwardness,but it's fine,it's fine.
Uh,sam haa girlfriend.
Maya hung out last nightwith her at sam'S.
Oh,that's not good.
No,no,no,it's good.
No,no,no.
No,it's good.
Why do you twolook like that?
-We're good.
-We're good.
-what?
-Your girlfriend is nice.
Oh,thanks.
You have a girlfriend?
Well,that's--good.
-it's good.
-It's really good.
Good morning.
Who calls their fath"big daddy"?
I mean,that's like--it's like"cat on a hot tin roof.
"It's like... charlotte king does.
She actually calls her fherbig daddy?
yes.
And,you know,he's dying,and,
I made a jerkf myselfin front of charlottebecause I was laughing.
Nice move.
Should I do something?
yeah,walk away,cooper.
Big daddy is notyour problem.
you have another kid thatwe don't know about?
Funny.This is julian.
It's the C.F.Family,sam.
Champ,come here.
It is just wrong--a single father,two kids,and all of them havecystic fibrosis.
And,uh,julian's fatherdoesn't sound so good.
hey,you two.
Is it photography day?
Yeah,I got graciea camera for her birthday.
She's,uh,been taking picturesof everything.
I'm making a scrapbook.
It's really great.
When I don't feel good,it gives me something to do.
Well,let's see if we canmake you feel better.Do you want to be first?
I'll keep your dad entertainedwith some percussion therapy.
Where you beat me healthy?
Or we can let addison dothe bronchoscopy lavage.
All right,we'll getyour labs done,get you out of hereas soon as we can.
You gonna be okayon your own,kiddo?
Dad,I'm 9.
all right,any dizzinessor slurred speech?
-No.
-Yes.
Seth.Will you please tell my sonthat I'm fine?
You still have weaknesson your right sideand a persistentvisual field defect.
I'm concerned.
Yeah,tell hershe needs to move.
I'm not moving to florida.
I can take care of you there.
I can take careof myself here,right?
Well,you're still at riskfor another stroke.
You should be with someone.
Are you ganging up on me?
Since dad died,you barelywant to talk on the phone.
That's not true.
-It's not true.
-It is.
He thinks I'm depressed.
I'm not.
I have friends.I'm not alone.
They're not family.You should be with family.
This is a big decision.
Deciding to move,uproot your life--it's huge.
But losing a spouseis huge,too.
Do me a favor,cynthspeak with our therapist?
It would make me fla lot more comfortable.
I thought I was okay with it,but I'm not sureif I am okay with it.
I'm sleeping with two men.
Do I get a lecture now?
Yes.
Yes,you do.
This is good.
This is progress.
Really?
That's my lecture?
It's fun,it's exciting,it'S... congratulations,man.
So you're okay with it?
Because the weird thing is,I'm okay with it,e-except for the part of methat thinks I shouldn't be, but--but I-I think I am.
Sex is good.
Relationships are bad.
Relationshipsare what cause peopleto be cold and lyingand deceitful.
I mean,you know.You're a therapist.
O-okay,professionally,I would dispute thatand suggest that you needto see your own therapist.
But personally?
Yes.
As a red-blooded american,sex is your birthright.
Go forth,enjoy--guilt-free.
I will.
I will exercise my right.
sorry to interrupt.
-The C.F.Results are back.
-How bad?
If this--if this is,uh,if this is serious,if I'm gonna die,please just tell me now.
Daron,your testscame back fine.
It's,um,it's gracie.
She tested positivefor burkholderia cepacia.
-It's a bacteriathat gets in-- -yeah,I-I-I knowwhat it is.
I'm sorry.
No.
It's gotta besome kind of a mistake.
Mean,she looks fine.Look at her.
Y-you're not gonna tell methat her lung function'sgonna start going downhill.
From her test results,it appears that it already has.
You know how contagiousthis bacteria can befor C.F.Patients.
It's a miracle that youand julian haven't caught it.
What we need to do nowis get gracie to the hospital,get her into isolationwhile we figure out what to do.
Okay.All right.
I'll--I'll,um,I'll take her there now.
No,daron,you can't take her.
You can't touch her,you can't be with heror you'll die. private.practice Season 02 Episode 12
I'm not being stubborn.
I don't want to move.
Moving to a new cityat any age is stressful.
But just for a minute,let's look at the other side.
Could this movebe good for you?
I can't move.
And I can't taiko himabout why I can't move.
And... he's not going to take nofor an answer.
and now... now he has samon his side.
Well,you can talk to me.
No.
If sethfinds out the truth,he's going to hate me.
Cynthia,anything you tell mestays with me.
Let me help you.
Talk to me.
You can't even... you can't even tell sam.
If I can't come near you,how are yougonna take care of me?
Well,we'll fiomre sethingout,honey.Okay?
I promise.
But for right now,you're gonna have to goto the hospitalwith dr.Freedman,okay?
She needs me.
You can't put yourselfat risk,or julian.
If either of you gets exposed,this will kill you.
So I just leave her alone?
Isn't there a family memberyou could call,someone who could help you,who could be with gracie
I got a sister in nashville,but she doesn't reallyknow gracie.
Look,gracie needs me.
Okay?
I need her.
she's alreadylost her mother,you know?
I'm--I'm--I'm all she has.
Look,I-I-I could weara mask,right?
We,you know,we could take precautions.
Daron,if you live together,you will get this,and there is no waywe can treat it.
Well,I need to be therefor both of them.
You know,they both need me.
how am I supposed to choose?
-I'll be back.
-Okay,take care.
Hey,how's,uh,how's gracie oh,uh,you know,not good.
She's trying to be brave,but she doesn't likethe hospital...
And I don't think thatshe really understandsthat not seeing her dador her brother,not living with them,that's permanent.
What were you talkingto charlotte about?
Oh,she asked me to doher neonatal roundswhile she goes to alabamato see her dad.
What,like you owe her a favorafter what she did to us?
Cooper,her father is dying.
I'm sorry about your dad.
If there's anything you need...
I'm fine.
I see deathevery day on the job.
It's a part of life,and I'll deal with it.
I'm late for my flight.
Cynthia is fully capableof making decisionsabout her own care.
And you're not at all concernedthat a 70-year-old womanstill recoveringfrom a stroke is putting herself furtherat risk by living alone?
Sam,you asked meto evalue her.
So she's not depressed,she is not clinging irrationallyto her independence.
She has legitimateeasonsfor what she's doing.
Which are?
Privileged.
I think it's confusingto maya,meeting a woman that you'vejust started to date.
-What?
-I think meeting a new girlfriendcould be... scary for her.
Do you have a problemwith sonya?
No,no.
You date whomever you want.
Just,uh,think abouthow this affects maya.
That was almostthe highlight of my day.
Not in the mood.
Cute kid.
What,I can't feelfor a patient?
Try me.

Rare bacterial infectionin her lungs.
Father can't be with her anymorebecause he has C.F.,Too, same thingwith her 2-year-old brother,because ifither of them getinfected with the bacteria,they'll die.
So father has to choose-- let his girl die aloneor stay with her and leavea 2 year old with C.F.Behind.
Burkholderia cepacia?
What?
I--ie had cancer patientsmanifestthe same bacterial complicationsas those with B.Cepacia.
I've had successeradicating the infection.
Okay,no one in the worldhas found a curefor cepacia syndrome,but you're gonnapitch me one?
I know cancer's a lot differentthan cystic fibrosis, and the bacteriais more drug resistant.I just... it's a tragic story.
Worth a shot.
Why would you help me?
I'm a doctor.
So...
I've spokento your mother,seth,and,um,she is not ready to move.
-Mom-- -seth,please,you won'tlisten to me.
Listen to her.She understands your concerns.
She has agreed to come infor weekly checkups with sam and counseling with meand to put a medic alert systemin her house.
And if her condition worsens,then we can always revisit this.
I promised...
I promised dad...
I would take care of you.
Most of my friends,the idea of a parentmoving in is terrifying.
We want you.
-Seth-- -it's not like I wantto put you in a home.
Please,seth.Stop pushing me.
Then help me understand.
You hate the city.You hate the traffic,you hate the crime--
-I-- -talk to me.
easy,seth.
I think I need A... mom.
Get an ambulance,please.
Is she having another stroke?
Is she having another stroke?
It was a transientischemic attack--press--a warning sign for a stroke.
It happenedbecause I got upset.
That's all.
I am fine.
You're not a doctor.
Your doctors are sayingyou're not fine.
Hey,I cameas soon as I could.
I'm fine.Everyone is making a fuss.
You're not fE.
-Hi,annette.
-Hey,seth.
Thank you for coming.
Listen,can you just wait outside?
We're discussing thingswith the doctors.

It's not about sides.
I'm sorry.
I'm--I-I can'T...
I'm moving you out.
I--I'll get a lawyer if I have to.
Talk to him.
Talk to your son.
He'll understand.
Violet,what's--what's going on?
She's right.
It's gotta bebetter than this.
I'm,uh,I'm not alone.
I have someone here... who... who loves meand who wantsto take care of me.
And...
I was afraidto tell you because...
I love you,too,and I...
I'm afraidyou won't understand.
Understand what?
I,uh...
I have someone.
Your mother's in love.
She has someone herethat she doesn't want to leave,and she was afraidto tell you.
************
I get that since dad'sbeen gone,it'been confusing,and--and--and you need to havesomebody here with you.
This is not who you are.
Seth,this isn't a reactionto your father dying.
I'm not talking to you.
Seth--this is just some... grief-stricken,crazy reaction.
No,no.
We've beentogether for years.
When you were with dad?
I am so sorry.
You cheated on dadwith her?
Seth... seth.

Just... get away from it all?
I can'T.C.F.Research to do.
Begins the day,ends the day.
Okay,I've got a little girlwho's about to die,kevin.
It's hard to think aboutgoing out and relaxing.
Well,you coulda called.
You--you coulda saiddon't come over.
You wanted me to cancel?
You're giving me attitude.
-I'm here.
-There are other thingsI could be doing.
I get a lot of invitations--my friends,women-- so what,you wantto date other women?
Maybe I do,but I don'T.
I'm not.
Because this is so much fun.
what hpened to us?
I mean... there was a timewhen you'd eatnoodles off my naked body.
What... what happened to us?
Look,I'm sorry.I thought...
I... usually think thathonesty is for the best.
Well,I knew at 15.
But,uh,back then... that was not what you did.
You... found a guy,got married,had kids.
And I loved him.
I did.
And then I met annette.
You know,our kidswere the same age,and she was...
I...
I couldn't stop myself.
Well,you were honestwith yourself.
That'S... that's sometimesthe hardest piece.
He's got to understand,right?
I mean... once he gets over the shock?
He loves you.
He--he wanted to dowhat was best for you.
He'll come around.
Electrons that detachand move around are called... atoms?
Free electrons.
Why are you beingso nice to me?
Ten'she last timeyou gave me answerswithout torturing me first?
I just know you... didn't havea chance to study last night.
Okay.
What do you wantto know about her?
Sonya?
I wasn'T... how was last night?
It was fun.
It wasn'T...uncomfortable?
Because,you know,you do nothave to hang out with your dadand his new girlfriendif you don't want to.
I like her mom,and dad really likes her.
You'd like her,too,if you got to know her.
Dot worry about me.
Dad's just having fun.
You should have fun,too.
You need to get a life.
Pete.
I can't stop thinkingabout you.
She loved sonya.
And why shouldn't she?
She's smart,she is pretty,and she is fun.
I mean,she--she brings overmoes and popcorn,and I,I just--I do homework.
Nai,you're her mom.
You're supposed to do homework.
And sonya is being funbecause she's tryingto make a good impression.
That's what happenswhen things are new.
You go out of your wayto be nice.
Look at me and kevin,you know?
Not so new,not so nice anymore.
That sounds like marriage.
you gonna end it?
Hey,um,I've been throughall of wyatt's research.
It's pretty convincing.
Wyatt?
He had an idea...to help.
Let's go find pete and coop.
So...
I could get her back?
It's a long shot,daron,but we'd like to try.
It's not gonna hurt?
I mean,I don't wantanything to hurt her.
Her lungs are already full,so we have to clear them.
So it's the same procedure.We just take a sampleof the bacteria.
We know that it workedon cancer.
we are hoping--really hoping--it can help gracie.
you know,she loves horses.
Her whole room is horses.
You know,I thought if she hadthese here in her room,that she'd feel more,uh...
I don't know.I'll,um,I'll go call her.I'll tell her maybe.
deliveryfor ms.Gracie rousakis.
He's worried about me.
I don't like itwhen he worries.
Well,you know,he's your dad.
It's his job to worry.
Tell him I'm fine.
Gracie--make him stop worryingabout me.
Since mom died,he's done everything.
And when he starts worrying,he starts coughing,anthen... you need to tell himI'm fine.
It's okay if you miss him.
I want my dad.
we got your page.
You've got togive her something.
Seth hasn't come back or called.
She can't stop crying.
We'll prescribesome lorazepam.
What you need to dois call sethand get him back.
Tell him... tell him she'll gowith him to florida.
I love youmore than anything,but you need your sonand you need your grandchildrenmore than you need me.
Please.Talk to him.
Tell him she'll go.
Just get him back here.
hey,I justwant you to knowthat your dad'soutside waiting.
He wanted to let you knowthat he's here.
What about dr.Cooper?
He's gone for the day,but you don't have to worry.
I am gonna takegood care of you.
Once you're asleep,I'm gonna use thisto clean out your lungs.
You'll feel much better.
See?
Who's that?
Then we're gonna give dellsome of what we took outto give to dr.Montgomeryand dr.Lockhartto test the antibiotics on.
I know it's scary,but when you wake,it'll all be over.
I just...
I hope it works.
Now we just need one of theseto stay clear, and then we'll know thatthe bacteria is sensitiveto that combinationof antibiotics.
By morning we should know,one way or the other.
Want to grab a bite?
Actually,I am starved,but I am supposed to,um... meet someone.
The cop.
Yes,the cop.
So you really thinka hot date and fine diningis better than a guyyou can barely standand cafeteria mac and cheese?
well...
I do love the mac and cheese.
From a psychophysiolicalstandpoint,this is remarkable.
-What is?
-You.
What you do to me.All day I couldn't stopthinking about you.
And--and ever sinceyou called,I...
I remember this tastinga lot better.
I don't know.
It takes me back.
To residency,you know,when life was simple.
See,I have a hard timepicturing you as an intern,taking crapfrom your attending.
By year two,they all hated me.
Oh,it took them that long?
sorry.
It's just,uh,yeah,they really hated me.
so'd my wife.
-You're married?
-Was.
The divorce took two years,four lawyers,hundreds of thousandsof dollars.
We--we discussed assets,property,money,the dog.
But not once... in all that timedid anyone ever ask meabout love.
I'm still bitter... about the dog.
I get what bitter does.
You have all that love,and then... where does it go?
You,too?
Member of the club.
So I'm gonna ask this again,but this time,pretenyou think I'm human.
You want to maybehave dinner with me sometime?
A date?
I... don't thinkat's a good idea.
Is it 'cause it's meor because of the cop?
Think about it.
nai?
I am not here.
This is not jealousy.
This is concern for my daughter.
Nai,remember whenmaya told you--remember when maya told youto get a life?
I have a life.
I have a--I have a great life.
I'm just--standing here on my patioin the darkspying on your ex,hisgirlfriend and your daughter.
I'm being replaced.
Sonya is my replacement.
That's maya's new mommy.
Oh,I am freaking--oh,god.
Ignore me.Ignore me.
I'm just freaking thank you.
Why aren't--why aren't youout with kevin?
it's not likewe're married,naomi.
I don't have to be with himevery night.
I don't have to callor check in, and if I want to talkto another man,it's not like we havepromise rings or anything.
Who is it,this other man?
Oh,no... wyatt asked me outon a date.
He'S... different than I thought.
Okay,well,um,can I just say that,uh,you're in a relationship,so,you know... knees together.
No,I am not a cheater.
Okay,I've done that.
I'm not gonna do that again.I don't know.
But I do wantto say yes to the date.
I just--I don't know.Should I?
I shouldn'T.Should I?
We are so screwed up.
this is a nice place.
Crazy humid.
Hi.
lung cancer.
Doctors gave him six monthstwo years ago.
He went into respiratory failurelast week.
How you holdin' up?
Well,let's see... duke and landryare downing bourbon,om t vapors, and not a one of 'emwants any partof making a decisionabout big daddy.
The vapors?
You have a medical degreefrom johns hopkins.
You've diagnosed your motherwith the vapors.
She's a drug addict,cooper.
But here in dixie,we're more polite about it.
what?
Why are you here,cooper,in the middleof my southerngothic tragedy?
I came for you.
landry was supposedto pull the plug this morning,couldn't do it.
Duke can't evencome in the room.
Sot's just you.
Just me.
He's not even there anymore.
It's just... the ethical,moral,medically correctthing to do.
Pull the plugand... it's done.
Are you okay?
No,not really.
So I've been having sex,lots and lotsand lots of sex.
Yes,with pete.
And with sheldon,many times.
Many,many... many times.
and I'm in pain.
And I can't stop peeing.
You need addison.
You've got honeymoon cystitisfrom too much sex.
So I will prescribe youan antibioticand something for the pain.
Violet turner,I amyour friend,and I know you.
Sleeping with sheldon and pete is not you.
Oh,come on.
When cooper does it,he gets a slap on the backand an attaboy, but when I do it--when--when a woman takes controlof her sexuality,she's a whore.
You are just not that person.
Something is going on here.
Mean,I don't know,you'reavoiding something or in denial.
Something psychological.
I don't know.You're the therapist.You know.
And you know th this is not good.
Wouldn't it be betterjust to figure outwhich one you want to be with?
How can I choose?
I mean,pete is... pete's all heat.
I just see him,and I melt.
And sheldon is comfort.
Like mac and cheese.
What?
Do you think this is okay,what she's doing?
I think that it's hardto figure outwho the right person is.
Thank you.
Yeah,I mean,kevin's great,but,you know,I mean,is--is he the oneor is it someone else?
I want to be okay withthis sonya thing.I do,I do.
But I-I don't think I care thatsam is dating,but do I care?
Am I in denial?
No,no,this is about maya,right?
I'm not crazy.This isabout maya.I'm not crazy.
Does this really look likethe time for therapy?
Thanks for coming in.
I-I just cameto pk up my laptop.
I left it yesterdaywhen I ran out.
Your mother needs you.
She is willing to moveall the way to floridaif that's what you want.
Think about it,seth.
Think aboutwhat's best for her.
The only thing I've been ableto think aboutis how stupid I wasnot to have fired this out.
Well,she wanted to tell you.
She was just afraid thatyou wouldn't accept her.
You know,it's notabout accepting her.
You think I can't acceptthat she's gay?
I've known annettemy whole life.
Now it's like I'm--I'm replaying every moment,every christmaevery thanksgiving.
You know,I was inthe backyard playing footballand they were...
-fooling around.
-You don't know that.
You think I wantto think about it?
And my dad?
She was everything to him.
She betrayed him.
She betrayed us.
You're a father.
You've gotta know how difficultit is to be a parent.
You love your kids,so you want to do everythingyou n to protect them.
So you try to figure outwhat's right to tell themand what's rightto keep from them.
And sometimes you don'tget it right,but... you know,you do your bestbecause you love them.
You thinkit would've been betterif your mother had leftyour father when you were a kid?
She was just tryingto keep the family together,trying to give you the motherthat you wanted.
I don't know her.
I feel no connectionto that womanbecause I don't know herat all.
She is your mother,seth.
She would give up everythingfor you.
Don't you thinkshe has given up enough?
I'm almost afraidto come in here.
We just need one dishwithout bacterial growth.
You make it soundso simple.
so that's what it looks likeinside of her lungs.
It was a long shot.
You had to try.We had to try.
-Addison--
-I don't thinkwe should have dinner.
Why?
Why,because of meor because the miracledidn't work?
I don't know.
Sam just left for st.Ambroseif you're looking for him.
Ohthank you.
I guess patient trumps lunch.
look,um,we didn't really get a chanceto talk the othenight,and,um,
-I just wanted to-- -no,look,you don't have to.
It's mewho should say something.
I knowit must have been weird,seeing me hanging outwith your daughter.
I remember what it was likewhen my mom dated.
Oh,no.No,no,no,no.
It's--it's fine.
Well,you know,I justwant you to knowthat,um... wherever this isheading with sam,I want to be really carefulabout maya's feelings.
I got burned a few times,so...
I get it.
Well,thank you.
That's,uh,very... thank you.
You're very ce.
Well,so are you.
big daddy always saidcancer was just his chickenscoming home to roost 'cause he didn't believein tears.
If he ever cried,he did it in private.
Cancer was justhis chickens... payback for beinga son of a bitch.
And he wasa son of a bitchto everybody... everybody but me.
He loved me being a doctor.
He loved that I didn't just... marry some boyand have a bunch of babies.
He would've killed mefor marrying a son of a bitchof my own.
'Cause he knew... what that would've been likefor me.
But if I'd have stayed... married some boyand had babies,I would've been here.
When he got sick,I would've been hereto take care of him.
So... these aren'this chickens.
These are my chickens,'cause now I'm the doctoring the family, and I knowwhat has to be done.
-charlotte--
-I can do this.
Shut up.
I can do this.
I can do this,damn it.
I can...
I can do thi-- -okay.
that's that.
It's okay to cry.
No... it's not.
daron,I'm sorry.
Nothing?
Well,we knew it wasa long shot,but I'm sorry.
I can't even go in thereto tell her.
I'll do it.
I can'T.
Gracie.
I want my dad.
Pete's gonna handle this.He'll take care of her.
I can't--I can't do it.I c-- here.
Here arethe keys to my house.
All julian's clothes... and his toysare in his room,okay?
Just,um... just make sure that,um,he knows why I did this... don't d--and that they take careof him.
-no,d-daron-- -y-you can't do this.
I will not let my daughtergo through that alone.
-but,daron,if yougo in there--
-I love my son,okay?
but I love my daughter.
he's not coming.
I can tryto talk to him again.
Maybe he just needsmore time.
It's my fault.I triedto keep it separate--who I was,who I loved.
you are who you are,and you shouldn't have tohide that from anybody.
I love you.
I-I made itall the way out to the airport,but I couldn't get outof the car.
I just... sat therefor an hourin the rental car return lI'm still tryingto understand this.
I know you took care of us.
Dad was happy.I was happy.
I guess it's your turnto be happy.
You should... stay herewith annette.
I'll,um...
I'll,um,I'll visit.
maybe sometime,we'll visit.
I'd like that.
daron gave up on his son.
Just... walked away from him.
Well,it wasan impossible choice to make.
It's hard to fault him.
The reality of gracie dyingwas right in front of him.
The idea of julian having tobury him or not be with him, it's just too abstract.
I just wanted to--oh,I'm sorry.
I--hey,pete.
-Sheldon.
-I didn't meanto interrupt a conference.
I just wanted to know if youwanted to come over later.
You're going overto his house?
Pete...
I'm sorry.Is there a-A...
Okay,look,um,pete,sheldon,I am,um,I'm sleepingwith both of you.
Uh,I thought it was okay,but it's not.
I realize that,uh,y-you--you just can't do that.
I can't do that.
And,um... and I'm sorry.
Who are you?
he's right.
I'm a mess.
we're all a mess.
Don't you know thatby now?
all I know is,don't mind finding out... who you are.
oh,hey.
I was,uh,I wasjust coming to see you.
Yeah?
Yeah,I,uh,I just wanted to say that...
I feel I have a responsibilityto our daughter... for her to knowwho I am,good or bad,uh, even if that meanstelling her who I'm dating.
I never want herto not know who I am.
I'm gonna say this,and I know how it sounds.
Maya likes her betterthan me.
She's your daughter,nai.
You are her mother.
She doesn't likesonya beer.
Sonya's just new.
I don't knowwhat I'm doing here. private.practice Season 02 Episode 12
We've landed in the middle of a murder enquiry.
I'll pick up the trail.
Well, you'd better.
Can I have a loan of your phone?
Ta.
Hi, Nathan.
Do you think I done good?
You really got 50 grand?
One phone call and then you can go home and tell your mum the happy news.
Call Billy yourself.
I'm not trapping him for you.
Dean nearly got kicked to death and then he gets nicked.
And we just turn our back on him?
I don't give a toss about Dean!
There's four of us here and we've got bigger problems.
Look, it may be worth you checking a few things out.
Me?
You said you wanted to know anything, yeah?
Show me the number.
If we're stuffed trying to go legit, we'll have to go back on the con.
Get some more forged ones?
Get dead people's passports.
Ellie Williams is a total fraud.
Ah, I was just coming to see you.
Something wrong?
Well, you tell me, Ellie.
If that's your real name.
I looked up that pub you said your parents ran in Basildon.
There are three Royal Oaks but your name didn't come up on any.
You looked me up?
Yeah, in fact, I couldn't find a single accurate reference to any of you, or anything you've said to date.
I want to know what's going on.
I trusted you.
Obviously not.
Well, do you want to tell me why I should?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
Just promise not to tell the girls I said.
They think they're finally safe here.
Safe?
We changed our names.
We had to.
Four years ago in a refuge for battered women.
SHE SOBS What am I like?
Do you know someone in Hope Springs that's passed on?
No, no, I just wanted to get away from the throng.
I always find churchyards peaceful.
I wish I did.
Your niece Katie, she's buried with her mother?
Yeah, my twin.
Not identical.
She died of a haemorrhage.
That's why we took Katie to live with us.
37 today, Alison would've been.
That means it's your birthday.
I don't bother with all that these days.
Not since this.
I just take a day off from the shop, and like you said, I suppose, reflect.
This is the first place that we've really felt secure.
That's why all the lies.
I feel terrible, Ellie.
It just didn't seem right, like you never existed.
Well, we don't, officially.
There's no paper trail for my ex to follow.
There are things you can do, restraining orders.
Oh, please
If he finds me, he'll kill me.
Just let him try.
You going to guard us 24/7?
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything, Gil, please.
If the girls found out we were at risk here, we'd have to move on, and I don't think I can take that.
Don't worry, nobody is going to blow your cover.
Thank you.
You don't know how much this means to me.
Well?
There is nothing to report.
It looks like they've got something to hide to me.
For God's sake, Ann Marie!
If you're jealous of Ellie Williams, get over it because you are making fools of us both.
I swear, lately, I hardly recognise you.
I'm just stressed about the wedding.
Well, take up your mum's offer to have it at the hotel.
Oh, no, except that would mean Ellie catering, and we can't have that, can we?
Course we can!
I was just checking to see if they were up to it.
It's make your mind up time, right?
Where're you going?
I've actually got something real to investigate - a murder.
MOBILE RINGS
Well, that sounds promising.
Forget it.
I'm not grave-robbing from Ina.
She's still grieving.
What did my one die of?
Car crash.
Buried last week.
Nice.
No.
It's not.
But at least it's legit.
What, stealing dead people's identities?
Hardly!
OK.
It's as legit as we're gonna get.
Let's be grateful we got a plan.
I'll keep checking the obituaries for me and you.
I'm sure this place is teeming with chicks like me about to cark it.
I'll just help Dean set up for lunch.
I still don't like it.
A boyfriend's a security risk.
I could say the same about you, Ellie.
For a fugitive on the run, it's time you told that local cop to back off.
The more Gil trusts me, the less we have to worry about.
You needn't worry about Shoo.
She wouldn't dare put us at risk again.
PLATE SMASHES
Shoo, are you OK?
What's wrong?
SHE WAILS Dean, get a broom!
'..
Nathan Donovan was found dead last night.
Oh, my God.
Nathan!
'.. early stage but a drugs-related gang murder cannot be ruled out. '
It wasn't drugs killed him, it was me!
What are you on about?
It was me.
What's happened?
Air, that's what she needs.
It's just one of her turns, she'll be fine.
What's wrong with her?
A form of mild epilepsy.
What?
!
It's only mild, it happens from time to time.
No big deal.
Just carry on.
I'm coming with her.
There's a danger you'll make it worse if she sees that you're worried.
I called him when I thought I was on my own again.
I never said nothing about you lot, just that I come into some money.
Go on.
I was that chuffed when he said he'd come up to Glasgow for me.
I caught him nicking the money when I was asleep.
I just flipped.
Where did get the gun?
Gun?
What gun?
No, no, there was never no gun.
No, I smashed him over the head with a glass vase, didn't I?
"The victim was found in an alleyway with three gunshots to the back of his head. "
You've led Ellie's psycho husband straight to us!
Have an eppie if you want but it's you lot I came back to when I realised he was on the make.
We gotta get out of here today.
Well, where are we supposed to go?
Barbados, as planned.
We're not even close to getting our passports.
If we don't have time to get 'em off the dead, we'll have to nick 'em off the living.
But you told me you had something on them.
I thought I did, but Gil's checked it out, and I'll have to accept it.
He's fed up with me now and he's beginning to get suspicious.
So?
Just tell him you're looking out for your mum.
That's the truth, isn't it?
Who are you trying to kid, Euan?
This is about you getting that land and me getting my house.
Look, if those women weren't there, your mum would leave.
She was all ready to go.
All I'm trying to do is...
You think I don't know?
But we've tried, Euan, and it's over, and I'm not jeopardising what I've got with Gil because of that Ellie Williams.
Or one stupid mistake.
Big mistake.
You say anything and I'll deny it.
How about I lend you the money for your house in advance, eh?
I don't want your money.
I just want you to leave me alone.
Well, this way I would, eh?
You could secure your big, fancy house in Edinburgh, you wouldn't need to see me.
For the minute, just tell Gil you've had a windfall.
Lie again?
He'd see right though me.
I think that's a pleasure reserved for me, darling.
Please, Euan.
Find somewhere else to build your holiday homes and leave me, Mum and Gil out of it.
This is mad.
I can't pretend to be Ina, I look nothing like her!
You've got brown hair, you're the same age, and now you're chummy with her, you can invite yourself over.
She was crying!
Look, we're up against it, Hans.
You're the lucky one!
Yeah, it's hard enough to find a dead looky-likey, let alone a real life one.
Um, hello?
!
Please Good news!
Ann Marie said yes to us catering her wedding.
Excellent!
How you feeling?
It goes as quick as it comes.
Right, we're off.
Off where?
The cash and carry.
If we're doing a wedding, we'll have to start planning.
All of you?
We've got work to do here.
You need to rest.
I'm fine, honest.
See?
Told you it was mild.
Fresh air, that's what she needs.
Well, that Shoo might be able to fool the rest of you but my head doesn't button up the back.
Hmm?
Mild epilepsy, my foot.
Right.
Let's find some looky-likies.
What the hell are you doing, boozing your day away?
You think guzzling wine's going to bring back your daft sister?
I wish she would come back.
Might have the odd laugh now and again.
As opposed to what?
A miserable life with me?
Well, you said it, Euan.
At least when Alison and Katie were here, I had some company.
I bet you're glad they're dead!
HE SLAPS HER
I'm going for a round of golf with Cameron's boss.
Find out why that clown Gil's still in a job.
This is the thanks I get, eh?
For trying to help find your niece's killer?
DOOR SLAMS
CAR STARTS, DRIVES AWAY
Hannah!
Come in.
Are you all right, Ina?
Oh, don't mind me.
It's like I said, this day always hits me hard.
I've brought you a little birthday lunch.
I thought you deserved some pampering.
I hope you don't mind.
I don't know, Hannah, it's not a great time.
All the more reason to share it with a friend, eh?
Oh, what the hell!
You're right.
There's no point wallowing, eh?
Take a seat.
A bottle of champagne, and I've baked you a cake.
Oh, how lovely!
Ina?
Your face.
Eh?
Oh, it's all that daft blubbing I've been doing.
I'll put some make-up on.
Don't want to scare you away.
Not now I know you've got champagne with you.
Did Euan do it?
My husband used to hit me.
I put up with it for nine years.
It was the biggest mistake of my life.
Euan's always been a VERY good husband to me.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.
Oh, you didn't offend me, but you would, if you said it to him.
He'd be very upset.
Of course I won't.
So you've got the wrong end of the swizzle stick there.
I'm just upset about my sister, now that's the end of it.
I'd love to see a picture of her.
Would you?
In that case, you pour the fizz and I'll go upstairs and get my box.
She kinda looks like me, right height, right hair...
She's Japanese, Shoo.
Bingo.
What do you reckon?
Umm.
You take the Jeep, I'll see you back at the hotel.
Come on.
We got to keep on looking.
I've kept all her bits and bobs, and Katie's.
Stupid things, really.
Da, da!
Blotches gone.
I even put some lippy on for you.
Nice fabric.
You'll think it's daft, really, but it's the only photograph of her I've got.
What d'you reckon?
Yeah, it's not bad, for kiddie food.
Store detective.
Yeah, she was checkin' us out earlier.
We haven't even done nothing.
We have been here three hours, Shoo.
Excuse me, girls.
Could you come with me?
'Security to the office, please. '
That's another one of Katie.
Last summer.
Pretty girl.
Mmm.
She was a wee minx, to be honest with you.
But what can you expect, losing her mum so young?
I loved having her around, though.
Another girl in this house full of men.
Me and Euan.
You look amazing!
Look at those shoulder pads!
I had money to spend then.
Now it's all tied up.
But I suppose Euan can thank me for that, setting him up in his own firm.
I'm sure there's a lot of things he should thank you for, shouldn't he?
Mrs Munroe?
Yes?
You have been selected at random from Cosmos loyalty card customers to take part in our prizewinning quiz.
All you have to do is answer three simple questions, and provided you can prove you are Rhona Munroe, you could win £1,000!
Oh, aye.
Give all your details, win a pile of nothing and get junk mail for the rest of your life?
There's no catch,
I can assure you.
My most treasured possession.
Maybe that's why I warm to you, you're so like her.
More so than I am, and I'm her twin.
To Alison.
Cheers.
Ready?
First question.
Right.
What is the capital of England?
London!
Correct.
Number two.
What is the capital of Scotland?
Oh...
Oh, God.
The capital of Scotland.
Yeah...
Gads, what is the capital of Scotland?
Scotland, where you live.
Well, it's either Glasgow or Edinburgh.
Uh-huh, yes, Scotland.
You live here.
I know, I know!
Oh, how embarrassing.
No, take your time.
Scotland...
Capital is...
Oh, let me think.
Just take your time, it's OK, take your time.
Get me - half sozzled and boring you with all my bits and pieces.
We haven't even had any of your lovely cake yet.
You cut us a slice, eh?
And I'll hide this somewhere.
You're back.
Where's Ellie?
She needs to look at this estimate.
She had some other things to do.
She'll be back later.
I can see very little evidence of you lot wanting to make a go of this place.
Well, disappearing, the lot of you, leaving Dean and me here on our own.
Least we're back, eh?
Good, because that couple over there want the beef fillet in the red wine jus.
What, like, you mean we've got to cook?
Well, Hannah's upped sticks and left, hasn't she?
And I'm off to have my lunch.
Right, well, they'll get what they're given from the chippy.
Oh, ah, and Glasgow was the City of Culture a while back.
Take a guess.
Just pick anything that comes into your head.
Oh, God.
OK...
Glasgow!
Glasgow?
Correct!
I thought I was going to have a heart attack there.
Me too, Rhona, me too.
Well done, you've just won yourself £1,000!
If you can just get your passport so I can verify your identity.
I thought you said three questions.
Oh, what am I like?
I should let you win for being so honest.
Go on, just ask me, get it over with, go on.
Right.
Who stars as the main pirate in the movie Pirates Of The Caribbean?
I haven't seen it.
Yes, you have.
I mean, you must have.
Come on, think about it.
I've heard of it, right enough.
You've seen it.
The main pirate.
The main one, the dark one, the American.
Good looking.
He based the character on that Rolling Stoner, you know, Keith Richards?
Who?
Keith Richards!
OK, OK, OK.
"My name's Captain Jack.
"Where's the rum, me hearties?"
Who played him?
I don't know!
Yes, you do, you do!
Johnny Depp.
I watched it last night.
Correct!
Oh, Greg!
What's all this, then?
Thanks to you, your mum has just won £1,000!
I was picked for a prize quiz from the cash and carry.
Three questions capital of England, London, capital of Scotland, Glasgow...
The capital of Scotland is Edinburgh.
No, it's not.
Aye, it is.
I just done a report on it for my last school project.
There you go.
Simple, but dead good.
Mmm.
So you say.
"So you say. "
Hope they choke on it!
The fuss they made over their lager.
You'd think, being Irish, they'd be a bit more humble, but not a bit of it.
And we've got them for another two days.
They're booked in?
More's the pity.
Shoo.
Look, I know we've both got responsibilities at work an' that.
But I'm your boyfriend, right?
Well, yeah.
You don't sound that sure.
Yeah, sure I'm sure.
We said to Ellie, didn't we?
No, no.
I said to Ellie.
But I'm starting to wonder cos every time one of your mates says jump...
Sorry, Dean.
So I was thinking, you did that Irish accent well good.
Cheers.
So how's this?
IRISH ACCENT:
"Oi'll have a pint of Guinness, to be sure. "
Well, you'll have to pay for it.
No, don't you get it?
There's two passports sitting right there.
He's a bloke!
Yeah, well, we've got to try.
"Re-established in 1999, the Scottish Parliament, based in the capital city of Edinburgh. "
See?
I told you.
Head Office must've had an off day.
What do I know anyway, I'm from Essex.
Still, the good news is you're within the time limit.
Three correct answers.
So I just need to check your passport and the money's yours.
Oh, wait a minute.
I got two out of three right, I'm the one who should get the money.
Oh, well, right enough, son, to be fair...
You have to have left school.
I have.
You have to have your own passport.
I do.
You have to be over 16.
I'm 17.
It says so on my passport.
Aye, you go and fetch it, darling.
That's £1,000 towards your student loan.
Bright.
Mmm.
Do you mind if I use your loo?
LAUGHTER
TOILET FLUSHES
Look, I didn't want to have to tell you this, but your mum wasn't picked at random.
A friend put her name forward as a deserving mum.
What for?
They thought she deserved a treat because of her... her illness.
Illness?
I don't know about any illness.
It's curable, don't worry.
But why would she have never said, then?
It must be serious.
I don't wanna say too much, out of respect.
I'll give her it.
Every penny.
No, no, you can't.
Cosmos won't hand out the money if it's not in her name because of the deserving mum scheme.
It's complicated, I know, but trust me, it has got to be her.
Mum.
She'll be fine, love.
Just, er, just don't say anything, will you?
Cos her friend said she didn't want anyone to know.
GROANS OF PASSION
If that's what the rules are, you don't have to twist my arm!
I love you so much, Mum!
I should win a grand more often, eh?
There you go.
Oops!
I'll, er, leave you to it, shall I?
Mum.
What's wrong with you?
I played a round of golf with your Super this morning and your name came up in conversation.
Just thought you should know.
You must be dead chuffed about the SIM card?
From Billy's mobile, didn't he tell you?
I thought it got stolen?
No, we found it in the end.
Yeah, it's off for forensic analysis as we speak.
Couple of weeks, we'll have a result.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Regardless of what you think of me, it could hold all the answers.
Well, I am.
Of course I'm pleased.
I'm just... well, shocked I suppose.
I thought it was gone for good.
But that's great news, aye, great news.
I know how angry you were when it went missing.
And it's definitely Billy McKenzie's SIM card?
It's not certain, but...
Maybe I'll just not tell Ina right now, till you're sure, eh?
No, agreed, she's had enough false hope.
Sadie?
Oh, welcome back.
Where is everyone?
Playing hide and seek for all I know.
Just like you, all afternoon.
You know Ina Harries?
Do you ever get the impression...
I mean, I was wondering whether she and Euan...
Do you think Euan ever hits her?
What?
!
You think she's one of those battered wives?
What's that about battered wives?
I was just wondering about Ina.
I paid her a visit today.
Ina's got a bit of a gob on her when she's been drinking.
She's more likely to be battering him.
And I wouldn't blame her if she did.
And she will not hear a bad word about him, I can assure you.
Right.
And, anyway, what are you doing visiting Ina when you've got a hotel to run?
Sadie, why don't you take the rest of the evening off.
Grab yourself a coffee and a sit down.
Yeah.
Well?
Result.
You?
Well, not Ina's, her sister's.
Her most treasured possession.
I feel sick about it.
Where's Beavis and Butthead?
I haven't seen them.
Well, they better hurry up.
I stopped by the travel agents.
There's a 7:30 flight from Glasgow.
I booked us tickets.
Ellie, about Ina...
I'm sure Euan's beating her.
I know the signs.
Well, that's awful but, Hannah, you just can't get involved.
Where the hell have you two been?
Room four.
They're in the shower.
OK?
So how come Cameron's got that SIM card?
I don't know.
Christ's sake, Ronan, I'm trying to protect you here!
It's all a mess.
I never meant to...
BUT YOU DID!
Is everything OK?
Where have you been?
I'm sorry.
I wasn't feeling well, so I went upstairs for a lie down.
I'll get the supper on now, eh?
Don't worry about me, I'm going out.
Ronan?
You trying to make a point or something?
No, I didn't mean that.
I've just had a sore head, that's all.
Hannah from the hotel came round.
She brought a bottle of champagne.
You called Hannah?
No, she just turned up.
For my birthday.
Euan, I never said anything.
OK, OK, back up, love.
It's just I don't want anybody stealing my thunder.
I was going to take you out for your birthday.
You don't have to.
To be honest I'm not feeling...
Don't have to?
I want to.
Why don't you go and do your face and we'll show 'em a birthday, eh?
Thanks, darling, OK.
I'll be right down.
We're flying separately, right?
We've got to give it a go, we've got no choice.
She can wear sunnies, I can put me hair up.
Not far off.
Not in the brain department.
It's a stupid name, innit, Ra-hona?
Right, 20 minutes, we'll meet out in reception.
Just bring what you need.
Flip-flops and a thong!
Oh, wait, wait, so Dean's going to cover the suppers.
He's really coming on in the kitchen.
He's coming on in the caravan!
Who cares about suppers?
We're leaving.
I care!
We've left enough unfinished business in this village, so humour me.
You all right?
So you've got time for me now?
Aye, well, don't let me keep you.
Dean.
I've have had enough part-timers in my life.
My dad, my brother.
I really like you but if you're not interested...
I am!
I...
I really...
What?
I just wish that I'd met you before.
Do you know what I mean?
So we met now.
That's what I'm trying to say.
You keep pushing me away.
Whatever happens, babes, and whatever you think...
.. you're the best boyfriend that I've ever had.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Where the hell is Ellie?
Hello, ladies!
Hannah, I just wanted to thank you for making such a fuss of Ina today.
You really brought her out of herself, eh?
I'm sure she's told you how hard this anniversary is for her so...
Yes, thanks, Hannah.
It was really kind of you.
It's my pleasure.
You deserve it.
Well, it's my turn to treat you next.
We could go into town, have a day out.
I'm sure Hannah doesn't want to spend all of her precious free time with you.
I think Hannah can speak for herself.
And Ina has a shop to run.
Well, Saturday, then, when Ronan's in... if you can get away.
Yes.
That would be great.
Huh, ladies who lunch, eh?
Come on, let's sit you down.
Saturday?
Looks like you're going to be the one letting her down.
No, I do understand about procedures, Frank, but I want the results off the SIM card as soon as possible, so put a rush on it, will you?
Right, OK.
Keep me posted, eh?
Gil!
Hi, Ellie.
I came to wish you and Ann Marie a wonderful marriage together.
She's a very lucky woman to have you.
Are you...
OK?
Yeah.
I just wanted to tell you that, whatever happens,
I hope you'll be very happy.
Are you trying to tell me something?
No, no!
Just congratulations and... have a nice life together.
Oh, God, Ellie.
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm really sorry.
Y
- You can't just...
You got the bags?
In the Jeep.
Got everything cleared up?
Yeah, more or less, yeah.
Where are you going?
Hospital.
It's the epilepsy.
She's had two more fits already.
You said it was mild!
It was, until now.
It must be stress related.
She definitely needs urgent medical attention.
So we'd better go.
What, all four of you?
Yeah, one to drive, two to hold her down if she fits again.
She could choke on her own tongue.
Hannah, there's no time.
Can I have a word?
Um, we're in a bit of a rush, I'm afraid, Ina.
I just wanted some advice, about what you were saying at lunchtime?
I'm sorry, Ina.
Sorry, we'll catch you later.
No worries, it'll keep.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, eh?
I'm not really sure about this...
leaving her.
Good afternoon.
Detective Sergeant McTear.
You are Frances Mac-fear-son?
McPherson.
I'm investigating a drugs syndicate and your mobile phone number has come up in connection with one of the ring leaders.
You what?
I don't know anything about drug dealers.
Can you confirm that this is your phone number?
My old number.
I lost it a couple of weeks ago, so I upgraded.
Lost it, eh?
Well, let's just hope your memory's in working order.
Brandy, please, Sadie.
I heard you had a bit of a close shave with that Health and Safety spot check.
Oh, I thought he'd close us down for sure.
Still, forewarned is forewarned.
He'll be back, that's their tactic.
See if you've carried out everything you've promised.
Eh?
That looks expensive, eh?
Ah, don't worry, Sadie, it's not your debt any more, is it?
In fact, I bet if you'd have known this were to happen a few weeks ago, you'd have upped sticks.
Oh, when I was on my own, maybe.
But I'm not now, am I?
No, no, I'm just saying... these lasses might not want to shell out that much.
They might want to move on instead.
So where does that leave you?
Back at square one.
I'm just saying you might need a contingency plan, eh?
Thanks.
Sorry, I've thought about this.
I've got go back.
Don't be daft!
Either stop this vehicle or I'll jump out!
BRAKES SCREECH
She's gone mental!
Don't be stupid, Hannah.
We're late as it is.
So go without me.
I'll catch you up.
You'll miss the plane!
I can't.
I can't do this to Ina, she needs me.
And I need you to get in the car.
Don't you mess about here!
I'm not, I just can't do this to someone hanging on by a thread.
Look, you can post the passport back.
For Christ's sakes, Hannah, Roy's got a hit on us.
You saw what he did to Shoo's ex.
I know this guy.
So go!
I'll buy another ticket.
I'll follow you on.
Josie.
Look, I'm Sorry, Hans...
Aargh!
TELEPHONE RINGS
'This is Hope Springs constabulary.
Leave a message if you like. '
ANSWER PHONE BEEPS
Gil, it's me.
Look, I'm sorry about this morning, darling.
I don't want to fall out and you're right.
I've been nosy.
I'm going over to see Mum at the hotel later, see if I can't patch things up.
So if you fancy a drink...?
And I promise I'll be nice to Ellie.
OK?
Bye.
ANSWER PHONE BEEPS
This is abduction!
So press charges!
We're only trying to save your life, you stupid cow!
Please, think what you're doing.
We don't want to leave without you.
Aargh!
She's lost it.
Look, I understand how you feel.
It makes me sick for Ina, too.
But we've got ourselves to look after and we're no good to Ina dead, are we?
She just has to look after herself.
She's done all right so far.
So had I, until I took a carving knife out the drawer and stuck it in Jim's gut.
He'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
I reckon he deserved it.
You don't understand
- I wish I'd killed him!
I still do.
Do you think I'm going to let that happen to another woman before my very eyes?
I know what I've got to do.
You called this number on the 21st, midday.
We have proof.
Honest, I don't know any drug dealers.
You're looking at ten years in prison, minimum, for concealing evidence of this magnitude.
I'm not concealing anything!
I wasn't even here on the 21st.
I was visiting my pal in Glasgow.
Hold on a sec.
I did let a girl borrow my phone on the way there on the bus.
What did she look like?
Um, English girl, blonde.
Which bus was you on?
Like I said, Glasgow from Inverness.
She got on at the same stop as me, at Loch Brae.
It was an emergency, pet.
I know you're worried and I feel rotten about not believing her, but we must keep busy till we hear something.
Hannah, what's happened?
Um, I left them to it, got a cab back.
It didn't seem fair to leave you and Dean on your own.
Where is he?
Toilet.
Freshening up for round two with you as the punching bag?
You've got to get out, Ina.
It'll only get worse.
Shh.
I'll tell him if you're too scared.
If he touches you one more time...
You're the one going to make things worse.
So you admit it!
Hannah... something up?
I'm just embarrassed, really.
I accidentally took something of Ina's away with me today.
Alison's passport.
I must have picked it up.
I know how much it means to you.
Yeah.
Thanks, Hannah.
Very kind.
C'mon, Ina, we're away.
Yeah.
What, no dessert?
No, I better not.
Course you should, sit yourselves back down.
Well, it is your birthday, doll.
OK.
You see what I mean?
You've got that one wrong.
Is Shoo going to be OK?
Um, oh, I don't know, Dean.
They may have to transfer her to a hospital a bit further away.
I'll keep you posted.
Right.
We've got to go back.
Eh, for Ina?
!
For Hannah.
For all of us.
I've been thinking about it.
What d'you think she meant when she said, "I know what I've got to do"?
The last time she had that look in her eye we all know what happened.
That's how she ended up in the nick.
If she loses it over Euan, we could have a police van picking us up before we even see a plane.
Yeah, you're right.
The thing is with Hannah, you never know what she might do.
I mean, she really hates that Euan.
I'm not surprised.
Well, we're going to miss the plane.
I've searched the whole of Kent, man.
They're nowhere.
Don't you understand?
We're talking about three million quid here.
Yeah, I know there's three million at stake, Roy, but it's a dead end, what can I tell you?
What do you mean, dead end?
It's like they disappeared into thin air.
So what, Marius?
You been mucking around for how many weeks, and you still ain't got a Scooby where they are?
I hope you ain't messing me around.
You'd better start looking a bit harder.
I'll call you as soon as I've got a lead.
Right, boss, count on it.
I don't want to live in Edinburgh, I've told you.
I need to get away and this place is ours, if we can only pay the deposit.
I'm sorry, but you have to find somewhere that you can afford.
We've got fire doors to be replaced, curtains, mattresses.
Thousands it's going to cost us.
Well, you've got other commitments now.
Oh, yeah, your big house?
I don't want you taken advantage of.
The only person taking advantage of me is you.
How dare you say that?
!
Because it's true!
You value a bunch of strangers over your own daughter.
Well, to hell with you!
Can I have a glass of water for Ina, Sadie?
She's a wee bit pished.
And we all know what can happen when you're pished, eh?
You're evil, aren't you?
I don't know how I didn't see it before.
Are you OK, Sadie?
Oh, families!
Who'd have them?
Oh, my god!
Don't!
Don't what?
Don't... eat too much of that.
It's full of calories.
Yes, I know.
But it's my birthday.
Yes, of course.
Go ahead... then.
No.
I don't think I'll bother.
I want to go home, Euan.
Ina...
No, you heard my wife.
We're leaving.
You go on ahead, Doll.
I'll settle this.
Heard about that spot check you had the other day.
Yeah.
Sounds very, very expensive.
I was just telling Sadie, actually, they won't stop there.
My offer still stands, Ellie.
I can take this place off your hands.
For the same amount you paid for it, no bills, no sitting tenants, no hassles.
Will you at least think about it, eh?
I'd hate to see you struggle.
Yeah.
Call me.
Shoo.
Doctor says she'll be fine.
He gave me an injection, didn't he?
You had me worried there.
Yeah?
As long as you're back, safe.
See you later.
We're going to have an early night.
Gotta get going first thing.
Ina, I know it's hard, but if you keep taking it...
Listen, Hannah, I appreciate your concern but please just pretend I didn't say anything.
Please?
Where've you been?
I know...
I'm sorry,
I was just in the middle of things.
That Ellie's just taken my own mother away from me.
I know, I know, I'm a jealous cow, but I can't help it.
Please don't be mad with me.
I'm not mad, love.
I'm sure you'll make it up with your mum.
As long as I've got you, Gil.
And our baby.
Whatever's gone in the past, the rest of it will be OK.
Our plane'll be taking off just about now.
I'm so sorry.
All that for nothing.
Here, you'd better put those back before those sex maniacs notice.
I've already given mine back to Ina.
I should've known better.
She's not even speaking to me now.
You can't expect someone to change their entire life just like that.
I'm just glad you didn't... you know.
SHE MIMICS THEME FROM "PSYCHO"
I'm not completely stupid... any more.
Hey!
'.. been arrested in connection with the murder of London drug dealer Nathan Donovan.
'Damien McFarlane, a drug addict and petty criminal from the Black Hill estate in Glasgow, 'was found in possession of the firearm used to kill Mr Donovan. '
So Marius didn't kill your ex, Shoo.
We're in the clear?
Looks like it.
I need a drink.
In his statement, Mr McFarlane claims he found the gun in a bin nearby.
Police are holding him for further questioning.
Have you won the lottery?
Just glad to be home safe, like you said.
Ah!
I've been thinking, these improvements that need doing,
I think I should pay for them.
I've got the money and it's my fault anyway.
I should have had those things done ages ago.
Too right!
No!
No, you leave your cash safe and sound where it is.
We'll find a way, as long as we got each other.
You mean you don't blame me?
No, of course not.
These costs are our problems now.
Don't you dare go touching your nest egg for us.
I'm off, babe.
And just so you know, you're the best girlfriend I ever had 'n'all.
Oh, time, Donal, please!
You're going to hurt him one day.
I'm pooped.
Do you mind if you lock up tonight?
Yeah, yeah, you go on up, love.
I've still got to check the takings.
Good night!
Can we please not have another day like today?
I'll drink to that.
Problem is, Ina will have another day like today.
Maybe even worse now I've stuck my nose in.
I wish I could give Euan a taste of his own medicine.
Josie?
CAR ALARM WAILS
Only thing he saw was stars!
Thanks, Josie.
That was a one off, right?
We've got to keep our heads down now we're stuck here a bit longer.
Yeah, and we've got a wedding to cater for.
Just as well, if we're going to afford all those improvements.
Where's my money?
What money?
The money you stole from my mattress.
The 200 grand you pinched from me, while I was worrying myself sick about her!
I'll give you ten seconds and I'm calling the police.
Calm down, Sadie.
Nine, eight, seven...
Ellie?
We only borrowed it, Sadie.
I trusted you.
I wanted to help you out.
And all you wanted to do was rip me off!
That's not true.
Sadie, I swear...
Three, two, one.
There's an explanation.
You can "explanation" it to the police.
Oh!
Ellie!
You can't just...
You wanna go back to prison?
Ooh, Ellie, I don't think this is the right idea.
Someone help me!
We've got to stop her.
SHOUTING IN HOTEL
Don't worry about me.
Worry?
You come up and kiss me.
Hold on.
Me kiss you?
Well, yeah.
Er, you kissed me.
Now that Sadie's out of the picture, I'll work on Ellie Williams and that place is ours.
Look, it's not too late to call it off, you know.
No.
We're going ahead as planned.
Marry me, Shoo.
I can't.
Gil, Ellie was saying what a perfect threesome we make.
Eh?
What's up?
Dean, we need to talk.
He's a hitman.
He's not going to leave any witnesses.
Bye, bye.

We've landed in the middle of a murder enquiry.
I'll pick up the trail.
Well, you'd better.
Can I have a loan of your phone?
Ta.
Hi, Nathan.
Do you think I done good?
You really got 50 grand?
One phone call and then you can go home and tell your mum the happy news.
Call Billy yourself.
I'm not trapping him for you.
Dean nearly got kicked to death and then he gets nicked.
And we just turn our back on him?
I don't give a toss about Dean!
There's four of us here and we've got bigger problems.
Look, it may be worth you checking a few things out.
Me?
You said you wanted to know anything, yeah?
Show me the number.
If we're stuffed trying to go legit, we'll have to go back on the con.
Get some more forged ones?
Get dead people's passports.
Ellie Williams is a total fraud.
Ah, I was just coming to see you.
Something wrong?
Well, you tell me, Ellie.
If that's your real name.
I looked up that pub you said your parents ran in Basildon.
There are three Royal Oaks but your name didn't come up on any.
You looked me up?
Yeah, in fact, I couldn't find a single accurate reference to any of you, or anything you've said to date.
I want to know what's going on.
I trusted you.
Obviously not.
Well, do you want to tell me why I should?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
Just promise not to tell the girls I said.
They think they're finally safe here.
Safe?
We changed our names.
We had to.
Four years ago in a refuge for battered women.
SHE SOBS What am I like?
Do you know someone in Hope Springs that's passed on?
No, no, I just wanted to get away from the throng.
I always find churchyards peaceful.
I wish I did.
Your niece Katie, she's buried with her mother?
Yeah, my twin.
Not identical.
She died of a haemorrhage.
That's why we took Katie to live with us.
37 today, Alison would've been.
That means it's your birthday.
I don't bother with all that these days.
Not since this.
I just take a day off from the shop, and like you said, I suppose, reflect.
This is the first place that we've really felt secure.
That's why all the lies.
I feel terrible, Ellie.
It just didn't seem right, like you never existed.
Well, we don't, officially.
There's no paper trail for my ex to follow.
There are things you can do, restraining orders.
Oh, please(!
)
If he finds me, he'll kill me.
Just let him try.
You going to guard us 24/7?
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything, Gil, please.
If the girls found out we were at risk here, we'd have to move on, and I don't think I can take that.
Don't worry, nobody is going to blow your cover.
Thank you.
You don't know how much this means to me.
Well?
There is nothing to report.
It looks like they've got something to hide to me.
For God's sake, Ann Marie!
If you're jealous of Ellie Williams, get over it because you are making fools of us both.
I swear, lately, I hardly recognise you.
I'm just stressed about the wedding.
Well, take up your mum's offer to have it at the hotel.
Oh, no, except that would mean Ellie catering, and we can't have that, can we?
Course we can!
I was just checking to see if they were up to it.
It's make your mind up time, right?
Where're you going?
I've actually got something real to investigate - a murder.
MOBILE RINGS
Well, that sounds promising.
Forget it.
I'm not grave-robbing from Ina.
She's still grieving.
What did my one die of?
Car crash.
Buried last week.
Nice.
No.
It's not.
But at least it's legit.
What, stealing dead people's identities?
Hardly!
OK.
It's as legit as we're gonna get.
Let's be grateful we got a plan.
I'll keep checking the obituaries for me and you.
I'm sure this place is teeming with chicks like me about to cark it.
I'll just help Dean set up for lunch.
I still don't like it.
A boyfriend's a security risk.
I could say the same about you, Ellie.
For a fugitive on the run, it's time you told that local cop to back off.
The more Gil trusts me, the less we have to worry about.
You needn't worry about Shoo.
She wouldn't dare put us at risk again.
PLATE SMASHES
Shoo, are you OK?
What's wrong?
SHE WAILS Dean, get a broom!
'..
Nathan Donovan was found dead last night.
Oh, my God.
Nathan!
'..early stage but a drugs-related gang murder cannot be ruled out.'
It wasn't drugs killed him, it was me!
What are you on about?
It was me.
What's happened?
Air, that's what she needs.
It's just one of her turns, she'll be fine.
What's wrong with her?
A form of mild epilepsy.
What?
!
It's only mild, it happens from time to time.
No big deal.
Just carry on.
I'm coming with her.
There's a danger you'll make it worse if she sees that you're worried.
I called him when I thought I was on my own again.
I never said nothing about you lot, just that I come into some money.
Go on.
I was that chuffed when he said he'd come up to Glasgow for me.
I caught him nicking the money when I was asleep.
I just flipped.
Where did get the gun?
Gun?
What gun?
No, no, there was never no gun.
No, I smashed him over the head with a glass vase, didn't I?
"The victim was found in an alleyway with three gunshots to the back of his head."
You've led Ellie's psycho husband straight to us!
Have an eppie if you want but it's you lot I came back to when I realised he was on the make.
We gotta get out of here today.
Well, where are we supposed to go?
Barbados, as planned.
We're not even close to getting our passports.
If we don't have time to get 'em off the dead, we'll have to nick 'em off the living.
But you told me you had something on them.
I thought I did, but Gil's checked it out, and I'll have to accept it.
He's fed up with me now and he's beginning to get suspicious.
So?
Just tell him you're looking out for your mum.
That's the truth, isn't it?
Who are you trying to kid, Euan?
This is about you getting that land and me getting my house.
Look, if those women weren't there, your mum would leave.
She was all ready to go.
All I'm trying to do is...
You think I don't know?
But we've tried, Euan, and it's over, and I'm not jeopardising what I've got with Gil because of that Ellie Williams.
Or one stupid mistake.
Big mistake.
You say anything and I'll deny it.
How about I lend you the money for your house in advance, eh?
I don't want your money.
I just want you to leave me alone.
Well, this way I would, eh?
You could secure your big, fancy house in Edinburgh, you wouldn't need to see me.
For the minute, just tell Gil you've had a windfall.
Lie again?
He'd see right though me.
I think that's a pleasure reserved for me, darling.
Please, Euan.
Find somewhere else to build your holiday homes and leave me, Mum and Gil out of it.
This is mad.
I can't pretend to be Ina, I look nothing like her!
You've got brown hair, you're the same age, and now you're chummy with her, you can invite yourself over.
She was crying!
Look, we're up against it, Hans.
You're the lucky one!
Yeah, it's hard enough to find a dead looky-likey, let alone a real life one.
Um, hello?
!
Please(!
) Good news!
Ann Marie said yes to us catering her wedding.
Excellent!
How you feeling?
It goes as quick as it comes.
Right, we're off.
Off where?
The cash and carry.
If we're doing a wedding, we'll have to start planning.
All of you?
We've got work to do here.
You need to rest.
I'm fine, honest.
See?
Told you it was mild.
Fresh air, that's what she needs.
Well, that Shoo might be able to fool the rest of you but my head doesn't button up the back.
Hmm?
Mild epilepsy, my foot.
Right.
Let's find some looky-likies.
What the hell are you doing, boozing your day away?
You think guzzling wine's going to bring back your daft sister?
I wish she would come back.
Might have the odd laugh now and again.
As opposed to what?
A miserable life with me?
Well, you said it, Euan.
At least when Alison and Katie were here, I had some company.
I bet you're glad they're dead!
HE SLAPS HER
I'm going for a round of golf with Cameron's boss.
Find out why that clown Gil's still in a job.
This is the thanks I get, eh?
For trying to help find your niece's killer?
DOOR SLAMS
CAR STARTS, DRIVES AWAY
Hannah!
Come in.
Are you all right, Ina?
Oh, don't mind me.
It's like I said, this day always hits me hard.
I've brought you a little birthday lunch.
I thought you deserved some pampering.
I hope you don't mind.
I don't know, Hannah, it's not a great time.
All the more reason to share it with a friend, eh?
Oh, what the hell!
You're right.
There's no point wallowing, eh?
Take a seat.
A bottle of champagne, and I've baked you a cake.
Oh, how lovely!
Ina?
Your face.
Eh?
Oh, it's all that daft blubbing I've been doing.
I'll put some make-up on.
Don't want to scare you away.
Not now I know you've got champagne with you.
Did Euan do it?
My husband used to hit me.
I put up with it for nine years.
It was the biggest mistake of my life.
Euan's always been a VERY good husband to me.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.
Oh, you didn't offend me, but you would, if you said it to him.
He'd be very upset.
Of course I won't.
So you've got the wrong end of the swizzle stick there.
I'm just upset about my sister, now that's the end of it.
I'd love to see a picture of her.
Would you?
In that case, you pour the fizz and I'll go upstairs and get my box.
She kinda looks like me, right height, right hair...
She's Japanese, Shoo.
Bingo.
What do you reckon?
Umm.
You take the Jeep, I'll see you back at the hotel.
Come on.
We got to keep on looking.
I've kept all her bits and bobs, and Katie's.
Stupid things, really.
Da, da!
Blotches gone.
I even put some lippy on for you.
Nice fabric.
You'll think it's daft, really, but it's the only photograph of her I've got.
What d'you reckon?
Yeah, it's not bad, for kiddie food.
Store detective.
Yeah, she was checkin' us out earlier.
We haven't even done nothing.
We have been here three hours, Shoo.
Excuse me, girls.
Could you come with me?
TANNOY: 'Security to the office, please.'
That's another one of Katie.
Last summer.
Pretty girl.
Mmm.
She was a wee minx, to be honest with you.
But what can you expect, losing her mum so young?
I loved having her around, though.
Another girl in this house full of men.
Me and Euan.
You look amazing!
Look at those shoulder pads!
I had money to spend then.
Now it's all tied up.
But I suppose Euan can thank me for that, setting him up in his own firm.
I'm sure there's a lot of things he should thank you for, shouldn't he?
Mrs Munroe?
Yes?
You have been selected at random from Cosmos loyalty card customers to take part in our prizewinning quiz.
All you have to do is answer three simple questions, and provided you can prove you are Rhona Munroe, you could win £1,000!
Oh, aye.
Give all your details, win a pile of nothing and get junk mail for the rest of your life?
There's no catch,
I can assure you.
My most treasured possession.
Maybe that's why I warm to you, you're so like her.
More so than I am, and I'm her twin.
To Alison.
Cheers.
Ready?
First question.
Right.
What is the capital of England?
London!
Correct.
Number two.
What is the capital of Scotland?
Oh...
Oh, God.
The capital of Scotland.
Yeah...
Gads, what is the capital of Scotland?
Scotland, where you live.
Well, it's either Glasgow or Edinburgh.
Uh-huh, yes, Scotland.
You live here.
I know, I know!
Oh, how embarrassing.
No, take your time.
Scotland...
Capital is...
Oh, let me think.
Just take your time, it's OK, take your time.
Get me - half sozzled and boring you with all my bits and pieces.
We haven't even had any of your lovely cake yet.
You cut us a slice, eh?
And I'll hide this somewhere.
You're back.
Where's Ellie?
She needs to look at this estimate.
She had some other things to do.
She'll be back later.
I can see very little evidence of you lot wanting to make a go of this place.
Well, disappearing, the lot of you, leaving Dean and me here on our own.
Least we're back, eh?
Good, because that couple over there want the beef fillet in the red wine jus.
What, like, you mean we've got to cook?
Well, Hannah's upped sticks and left, hasn't she?
And I'm off to have my lunch.
Right, well, they'll get what they're given from the chippy.
Oh, ah, and Glasgow was the City of Culture a while back.
Take a guess.
Just pick anything that comes into your head.
Oh, God.
OK...
Glasgow!
Glasgow?
Correct!
I thought I was going to have a heart attack there.
Me too, Rhona, me too.
Well done, you've just won yourself £1,000!
If you can just get your passport so I can verify your identity.
I thought you said three questions.
Oh, what am I like?
I should let you win for being so honest.
Go on, just ask me, get it over with, go on.
Right.
Who stars as the main pirate in the movie Pirates Of The Caribbean?
I haven't seen it.
Yes, you have.
I mean, you must have.
Come on, think about it.
I've heard of it, right enough.
You've seen it.
The main pirate.
The main one, the dark one, the American.
Good looking.
He based the character on that Rolling Stoner, you know, Keith Richards?
Who?
Keith Richards!
OK, OK, OK.
"My name's Captain Jack.
"Where's the rum, me hearties?"
Who played him?
I don't know!
Yes, you do, you do!
Johnny Depp.
I watched it last night.
Correct!
Oh, Greg!
What's all this, then?
Thanks to you, your mum has just won £1,000!
I was picked for a prize quiz from the cash and carry.
Three questions capital of England, London, capital of Scotland, Glasgow...
The capital of Scotland is Edinburgh.
No, it's not.
Aye, it is.
I just done a report on it for my last school project.
There you go.
Simple, but dead good.
Mmm.
So you say.
"So you say."
Hope they choke on it!
The fuss they made over their lager.
You'd think, being Irish, they'd be a bit more humble, but not a bit of it.
And we've got them for another two days.
They're booked in?
More's the pity.
Shoo.
Look, I know we've both got responsibilities at work an' that.
But I'm your boyfriend, right?
Well, yeah.
You don't sound that sure.
Yeah, sure I'm sure.
We said to Ellie, didn't we?
No, no.
I said to Ellie.
But I'm starting to wonder cos every time one of your mates says jump...
Sorry, Dean.
So I was thinking, you did that Irish accent well good.
Cheers.
So how's this?
IRISH ACCENT: "Oi'll have a pint of Guinness, to be sure."
Well, you'll have to pay for it.
No, don't you get it?
There's two passports sitting right there.
He's a bloke!
Yeah, well, we've got to try.
"Re-established in 1999, the Scottish Parliament, based in the capital city of Edinburgh."
See?
I told you.
Head Office must've had an off day.
What do I know anyway, I'm from Essex.
Still, the good news is you're within the time limit.
Three correct answers.
So I just need to check your passport and the money's yours.
Oh, wait a minute.
I got two out of three right, I'm the one who should get the money.
Oh, well, right enough, son, to be fair...
You have to have left school.
I have.
You have to have your own passport.
I do.
You have to be over 16.
I'm 17.
It says so on my passport.
Aye, you go and fetch it, darling.
That's £1,000 towards your student loan.
Bright.
Mmm.
Do you mind if I use your loo?
LAUGHTER
TOILET FLUSHES
Look, I didn't want to have to tell you this, but your mum wasn't picked at random.
A friend put her name forward as a deserving mum.
What for?
They thought she deserved a treat because of her... her illness.
Illness?
I don't know about any illness.
It's curable, don't worry.
But why would she have never said, then?
It must be serious.
I don't wanna say too much, out of respect.
I'll give her it.
Every penny.
No, no, you can't.
Cosmos won't hand out the money if it's not in her name because of the deserving mum scheme.
It's complicated, I know, but trust me, it has got to be her.
Mum.
She'll be fine, love.
Just, er, just don't say anything, will you?
Cos her friend said she didn't want anyone to know.
GROANS OF PASSION
If that's what the rules are, you don't have to twist my arm!
I love you so much, Mum!
I should win a grand more often, eh?
There you go.
Oops!
I'll, er, leave you to it, shall I?
Mum.
What's wrong with you?
I played a round of golf with your Super this morning and your name came up in conversation.
Just thought you should know.
You must be dead chuffed about the SIM card?
From Billy's mobile, didn't he tell you?
I thought it got stolen?
No, we found it in the end.
Yeah, it's off for forensic analysis as we speak.
Couple of weeks, we'll have a result.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Regardless of what you think of me, it could hold all the answers.
Well, I am.
Of course I'm pleased.
I'm just... well, shocked I suppose.
I thought it was gone for good.
But that's great news, aye, great news.
I know how angry you were when it went missing.
And it's definitely Billy McKenzie's SIM card?
It's not certain, but...
Maybe I'll just not tell Ina right now, till you're sure, eh?
No, agreed, she's had enough false hope.
Sadie?
Oh, welcome back.
Where is everyone?
Playing hide and seek for all I know.
Just like you, all afternoon.
You know Ina Harries?
Do you ever get the impression...
I mean, I was wondering whether she and Euan...
Do you think Euan ever hits her?
What?
!
You think she's one of those battered wives?
What's that about battered wives?
I was just wondering about Ina.
I paid her a visit today.
Ina's got a bit of a gob on her when she's been drinking.
She's more likely to be battering him.
And I wouldn't blame her if she did.
And she will not hear a bad word about him, I can assure you.
Right.
And, anyway, what are you doing visiting Ina when you've got a hotel to run?
Sadie, why don't you take the rest of the evening off.
Grab yourself a coffee and a sit down.
Yeah.
(And how about a happy pill while you're at it?
) Well?
Result.
You?
Well, not Ina's, her sister's.
Her most treasured possession.
I feel sick about it.
Where's Beavis and Butthead?
I haven't seen them.
Well, they better hurry up.
I stopped by the travel agents.
There's a 7:30 flight from Glasgow.
I booked us tickets.
Ellie, about Ina...
I'm sure Euan's beating her.
I know the signs.
Well, that's awful but, Hannah, you just can't get involved.
Where the hell have you two been?
Room four.
They're in the shower.
OK?
So how come Cameron's got that SIM card?
I don't know.
Christ's sake, Ronan, I'm trying to protect you here!
It's all a mess.
I never meant to...
BUT YOU DID!
Is everything OK?
Where have you been?
I'm sorry.
I wasn't feeling well, so I went upstairs for a lie down.
I'll get the supper on now, eh?
Don't worry about me, I'm going out.
Ronan?
You trying to make a point or something?
No, I didn't mean that.
I've just had a sore head, that's all.
Hannah from the hotel came round.
She brought a bottle of champagne.
You called Hannah?
No, she just turned up.
For my birthday.
Euan, I never said anything.
OK, OK, back up, love.
It's just I don't want anybody stealing my thunder.
I was going to take you out for your birthday.
You don't have to.
To be honest I'm not feeling...
Don't have to?
I want to.
Why don't you go and do your face and we'll show 'em a birthday, eh?
Thanks, darling, OK.
I'll be right down.
We're flying separately, right?
We've got to give it a go, we've got no choice.
She can wear sunnies, I can put me hair up.
Not far off.
Not in the brain department.
It's a stupid name, innit, Ra-hona?
Right, 20 minutes, we'll meet out in reception.
Just bring what you need.
Flip-flops and a thong!
Oh, wait, wait, so Dean's going to cover the suppers.
He's really coming on in the kitchen.
He's coming on in the caravan!
Who cares about suppers?
We're leaving.
I care!
We've left enough unfinished business in this village, so humour me.
You all right?
So you've got time for me now?
Aye, well, don't let me keep you.
Dean.
I've have had enough part-timers in my life.
My dad, my brother.
I really like you but if you're not interested...
I am!
I...
I really...
What?
I just wish that I'd met you before.
Do you know what I mean?
So we met now.
That's what I'm trying to say.
You keep pushing me away.
Whatever happens, babes, and whatever you think...
..you're the best boyfriend that I've ever had.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Where the hell is Ellie?
Hello, ladies!
Hannah, I just wanted to thank you for making such a fuss of Ina today.
You really brought her out of herself, eh?
I'm sure she's told you how hard this anniversary is for her so...
Yes, thanks, Hannah.
It was really kind of you.
It's my pleasure.
You deserve it.
Well, it's my turn to treat you next.
We could go into town, have a day out.
I'm sure Hannah doesn't want to spend all of her precious free time with you.
I think Hannah can speak for herself.
And Ina has a shop to run.
Well, Saturday, then, when Ronan's in...if you can get away.
Yes.
That would be great.
Huh, ladies who lunch, eh?
Come on, let's sit you down.
Saturday?
Looks like you're going to be the one letting her down.
No, I do understand about procedures, Frank, but I want the results off the SIM card as soon as possible, so put a rush on it, will you?
Right, OK.
Keep me posted, eh?
Gil!
Hi, Ellie.
I came to wish you and Ann Marie a wonderful marriage together.
She's a very lucky woman to have you.
Are you...
OK?
Yeah.
I just wanted to tell you that, whatever happens,
I hope you'll be very happy.
Are you trying to tell me something?
No, no!
Just congratulations and...
have a nice life together.
Oh, God, Ellie.
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm really sorry.
Y-You can't just...
You got the bags?
In the Jeep.
Got everything cleared up?
Yeah, more or less, yeah.
Where are you going?
Hospital.
It's the epilepsy.
She's had two more fits already.
You said it was mild!
It was, until now.
It must be stress related.
She definitely needs urgent medical attention.
So we'd better go.
What, all four of you?
Yeah, one to drive, two to hold her down if she fits again.
She could choke on her own tongue.
Hannah, there's no time.
Can I have a word?
Um, we're in a bit of a rush, I'm afraid, Ina.
I just wanted some advice, about what you were saying at lunchtime?
I'm sorry, Ina.
Sorry, we'll catch you later.
No worries, it'll keep.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, eh?
I'm not really sure about this...
leaving her.
Good afternoon.
Detective Sergeant McTear.
You are Frances Mac-fear-son?
McPherson.
I'm investigating a drugs syndicate and your mobile phone number has come up in connection with one of the ring leaders.
You what?
I don't know anything about drug dealers.
Can you confirm that this is your phone number?
My old number.
I lost it a couple of weeks ago, so I upgraded.
Lost it, eh?
Well, let's just hope your memory's in working order.
Brandy, please, Sadie.
I heard you had a bit of a close shave with that Health and Safety spot check.
Oh, I thought he'd close us down for sure.
Still, forewarned is forewarned.
He'll be back, that's their tactic.
See if you've carried out everything you've promised.
Eh?
That looks expensive, eh?
Ah, don't worry, Sadie, it's not your debt any more, is it?
In fact, I bet if you'd have known this were to happen a few weeks ago, you'd have upped sticks.
Oh, when I was on my own, maybe.
But I'm not now, am I?
No, no, I'm just saying... these lasses might not want to shell out that much.
They might want to move on instead.
So where does that leave you?
Back at square one.
I'm just saying you might need a contingency plan, eh?
Thanks.
Sorry, I've thought about this.
I've got go back.
Don't be daft!
Either stop this vehicle or I'll jump out!
BRAKES SCREECH
She's gone mental!
Don't be stupid, Hannah.
We're late as it is.
So go without me.
I'll catch you up.
You'll miss the plane!
I can't.
I can't do this to Ina, she needs me.
And I need you to get in the car.
Don't you mess about here!
I'm not, I just can't do this to someone hanging on by a thread.
Look, you can post the passport back.
For Christ's sakes, Hannah, Roy's got a hit on us.
You saw what he did to Shoo's ex.
I know this guy.
So go!
I'll buy another ticket.
I'll follow you on.
Josie.
Look, I'm Sorry, Hans...
Aargh!
TELEPHONE RINGS
'This is Hope Springs constabulary.
Leave a message if you like.'
ANSWER PHONE BEEPS
Gil, it's me.
Look, I'm sorry about this morning, darling.
I don't want to fall out and you're right.
I've been nosy.
I'm going over to see Mum at the hotel later, see if I can't patch things up.
So if you fancy a drink...?
And I promise I'll be nice to Ellie.
OK?
Bye.
ANSWER PHONE BEEPS
This is abduction!
So press charges!
We're only trying to save your life, you stupid cow!
Please, think what you're doing.
We don't want to leave without you.
Aargh!
She's lost it.
Look, I understand how you feel.
It makes me sick for Ina, too.
But we've got ourselves to look after and we're no good to Ina dead, are we?
She just has to look after herself.
She's done all right so far.
So had I, until I took a carving knife out the drawer and stuck it in Jim's gut.
He'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
I reckon he deserved it.
You don't understand - I wish I'd killed him!
I still do.
Do you think I'm going to let that happen to another woman before my very eyes?
I know what I've got to do.
You called this number on the 21st, midday.
We have proof.
Honest, I don't know any drug dealers.
You're looking at ten years in prison, minimum, for concealing evidence of this magnitude.
I'm not concealing anything!
I wasn't even here on the 21st.
I was visiting my pal in Glasgow.
Hold on a sec.
I did let a girl borrow my phone on the way there on the bus.
What did she look like?
Um, English girl, blonde.
Which bus was you on?
Like I said, Glasgow from Inverness.
She got on at the same stop as me, at Loch Brae.
It was an emergency, pet.
I know you're worried and I feel rotten about not believing her, but we must keep busy till we hear something.
Hannah, what's happened?
Um, I left them to it, got a cab back.
It didn't seem fair to leave you and Dean on your own.
Where is he?
Toilet.
Freshening up for round two with you as the punching bag?
You've got to get out, Ina.
It'll only get worse.
Shh.
I'll tell him if you're too scared.
If he touches you one more time...
You're the one going to make things worse.
So you admit it!
Hannah...something up?
I'm just embarrassed, really.
I accidentally took something of Ina's away with me today.
Alison's passport.
I must have picked it up.
I know how much it means to you.
Yeah.
Thanks, Hannah.
Very kind.
C'mon, Ina, we're away.
Yeah.
What, no dessert?
No, I better not.
Course you should, sit yourselves back down.
Well, it is your birthday, doll.
OK.
You see what I mean?
You've got that one wrong.
Is Shoo going to be OK?
Um, oh, I don't know, Dean.
They may have to transfer her to a hospital a bit further away.
I'll keep you posted.
Right.
We've got to go back.
Eh, for Ina?
!
For Hannah.
For all of us.
I've been thinking about it.
What d'you think she meant when she said, "I know what I've got to do"?
The last time she had that look in her eye we all know what happened.
That's how she ended up in the nick.
If she loses it over Euan, we could have a police van picking us up before we even see a plane.
Yeah, you're right.
The thing is with Hannah, you never know what she might do.
I mean, she really hates that Euan.
I'm not surprised.
Well, we're going to miss the plane.
I've searched the whole of Kent, man.
They're nowhere.
Don't you understand?
We're talking about three million quid here.
Yeah, I know there's three million at stake, Roy, but it's a dead end, what can I tell you?
What do you mean, dead end?
It's like they disappeared into thin air.
So what, Marius?
You been mucking around for how many weeks, and you still ain't got a Scooby where they are?
I hope you ain't messing me around.
You'd better start looking a bit harder.
I'll call you as soon as I've got a lead.
Right, boss, count on it.
I don't want to live in Edinburgh, I've told you.
I need to get away and this place is ours, if we can only pay the deposit.
I'm sorry, but you have to find somewhere that you can afford.
We've got fire doors to be replaced, curtains, mattresses.
Thousands it's going to cost us.
Well, you've got other commitments now.
Oh, yeah, your big house?
I don't want you taken advantage of.
The only person taking advantage of me is you.
How dare you say that?
!
Because it's true!
You value a bunch of strangers over your own daughter.
Well, to hell with you!
Can I have a glass of water for Ina, Sadie?
She's a wee bit pished.
And we all know what can happen when you're pished, eh?
You're evil, aren't you?
I don't know how I didn't see it before.
Are you OK, Sadie?
Oh, families!
Who'd have them?
Oh, my god!
Don't!
Don't what?
Don't...eat too much of that.
It's full of calories.
Yes, I know.
But it's my birthday.
Yes, of course.
Go ahead...then.
No.
I don't think I'll bother.
I want to go home, Euan.
Ina...
No, you heard my wife.
We're leaving.
You go on ahead, Doll.
I'll settle this.
Heard about that spot check you had the other day.
Yeah.
Sounds very, very expensive.
I was just telling Sadie, actually, they won't stop there.
My offer still stands, Ellie.
I can take this place off your hands.
For the same amount you paid for it, no bills, no sitting tenants, no hassles.
Will you at least think about it, eh?
I'd hate to see you struggle.
Yeah.
Call me.
Shoo.
Doctor says she'll be fine.
He gave me an injection, didn't he?
You had me worried there.
Yeah?
As long as you're back, safe.
See you later.
We're going to have an early night.
Gotta get going first thing.
Ina, I know it's hard, but if you keep taking it...
Listen, Hannah, I appreciate your concern but please just pretend I didn't say anything.
Please?
Where've you been?
I know...
I'm sorry,
I was just in the middle of things.
That Ellie's just taken my own mother away from me.
I know, I know, I'm a jealous cow, but I can't help it.
Please don't be mad with me.
I'm not mad, love.
I'm sure you'll make it up with your mum.
As long as I've got you, Gil.
And our baby.
Whatever's gone in the past, the rest of it will be OK.
Our plane'll be taking off just about now.
I'm so sorry.
All that for nothing.
Here, you'd better put those back before those sex maniacs notice.
I've already given mine back to Ina.
I should've known better.
She's not even speaking to me now.
You can't expect someone to change their entire life just like that.
I'm just glad you didn't...you know.
SHE MIMICS THEME FROM "PSYCHO"
I'm not completely stupid...
any more.
Hey!
TV: '..been arrested in connection with the murder of London drug dealer Nathan Donovan.
'Damien McFarlane, a drug addict and petty criminal from the Black Hill estate in Glasgow, 'was found in possession of the firearm used to kill Mr Donovan.'
So Marius didn't kill your ex, Shoo.
We're in the clear?
Looks like it.
I need a drink.
In his statement, Mr McFarlane claims he found the gun in a bin nearby.
Police are holding him for further questioning.
Have you won the lottery?
Just glad to be home safe, like you said.
Ah!
I've been thinking, these improvements that need doing,
I think I should pay for them.
I've got the money and it's my fault anyway.
I should have had those things done ages ago.
Too right!
No!
No, you leave your cash safe and sound where it is.
We'll find a way, as long as we got each other.
You mean you don't blame me?
No, of course not.
These costs are our problems now.
Don't you dare go touching your nest egg for us.
I'm off, babe.
And just so you know, you're the best girlfriend I ever had 'n'all.
Oh, time, Donal, please!
You're going to hurt him one day.
I'm pooped.
Do you mind if you lock up tonight?
Yeah, yeah, you go on up, love.
I've still got to check the takings.
Good night!
Can we please not have another day like today?
I'll drink to that.
Problem is, Ina will have another day like today.
Maybe even worse now I've stuck my nose in.
I wish I could give Euan a taste of his own medicine.
Josie?
CAR ALARM WAILS
Only thing he saw was stars!
Thanks, Josie.
That was a one off, right?
We've got to keep our heads down now we're stuck here a bit longer.
Yeah, and we've got a wedding to cater for.
Just as well, if we're going to afford all those improvements.
Where's my money?
What money?
The money you stole from my mattress.
The 200 grand you pinched from me, while I was worrying myself sick about her!
I'll give you ten seconds and I'm calling the police.
Calm down, Sadie.
Nine, eight, seven...
Ellie?
We only borrowed it, Sadie.
I trusted you.
I wanted to help you out.
And all you wanted to do was rip me off!
That's not true.
Sadie, I swear...
Three, two, one.
There's an explanation.
You can "explanation" it to the police.
Oh!
Ellie!
You can't just...
You wanna go back to prison?
Ooh, Ellie, I don't think this is the right idea.
Someone help me!
We've got to stop her.
SHOUTING IN HOTEL
Don't worry about me.
Worry?
You come up and kiss me.
Hold on.
Me kiss you?
Well, yeah.
Er, you kissed me.
Now that Sadie's out of the picture, I'll work on Ellie Williams and that place is ours.
Look, it's not too late to call it off, you know.
No.
We're going ahead as planned.
Marry me, Shoo.
I can't.
Gil, Ellie was saying what a perfect threesome we make.
Eh?
What's up?
Dean, we need to talk.
He's a hitman.
He's not going to leave any witnesses.
Bye, bye.

Damn.
- They woke you too?
- Yep.
You know that Big Yoni guy uses my toilet?
- Yep.
- And he leaves floaters!
- I didn't know that.
- What are we gonna do?
Talk to Aaron.
I called him, he's on his way.
- You seen my Fruit Loops?
- Nope.
Big Yoni's eating them outside.
- This guy's pushing me.
- Bagel Broker.
- Nice!
- What is with your face?
They surprised me with a new scene when I got to the set last night - battery acid sprays out of my car engine.
Four hours of makeup for one line, compliments of Dan Coakley.
- Why didn't you take it off?
- I've got to shoot again tonight.
I can't bear another session in the makeup chair.
- Now you've got two bad sides.
- Don't start with me, Turtle.
- I'm exhausted.
- Oh, you are?
!
We've got the Israeli army waking us up all night and you can go home!
Baby bro was hungry and you can go to Jamie's.
I'm a friend who doesn't leave his boy in crisis.
Appreciate that, Turtle.
Since Jamie's too scared to sleep here,
I'm having a little crisis of my own.
You've gone years without pussy, a couple days won't kill you.
- Shut your mouth, acid face!
- You want to go?
- Yeah, I do!
- Don't fucking get in my face.
You're disgusting.
- You boys OK?
- Actually no, we're not.
- He started it.
- One of your goons ate my Fruit Loops.
The same goon keeps pummelling my toilet.
- I'm sorry.
I'll talk to him.
- And I thought your man outside was gonna shoot me when I pulled up this morning.
- It's makeup.
- Aaron, everyone's a little tense with all the people around the house constantly.
How much longer do you think we'll have this much security?
I can scale it back if that's what you want.
But you should hear what we found on this guy before you make that decision.
- Here's a report.
He has a few arrests.
- He tried to kill his father?
As a child, he had an affinity for setting fires.
At the age of 12, he burned down his house, badly injuring his father.
He was questioned and cleared.
- Jesus.
- Creepy.
- We'll keep the security.
- It shouldn't be for much longer.
We have this guy under 24-hour surveillance.
- So what should we do?
- What you normally do.
- Well, I have a fitting today.
- No worries.
Live your life as usual.
My guys will be there just in case of any surprises.
- I'll be there too, bro.
- Appreciate it, Johnny.
- But lose the makeup, huh?
- No can do.
OK.
Turtle, you want to come also?
- I got class.
- So much for you being a good friend.
- I have a perfect attendance record.
- It's OK, you go to class.
But do me a favour, call E, have him meet me there
- because it looks like I have a ride.
- You got it, boss.
Hello?
- Yo, wake up.
- What time is it?
I don't know, seven-something.
- Are you alone?
- No.
- Ashley?
- Who else?
- With you, who knows?
- She wake you up with a BJ, E?
- What's up?
- Tell her she should.
What's up?
Vince wanted me to tell you to meet him at the fitting.
- Sounds good.
- Not as good as a morning BJ.
OK, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.
- Who was that?
- It was Turtle.
Oh, what did he want?
Just to tell me that I have to meet Vince at the fitting.
I gotta get up.
Eric, was that... really Turtle?
Yeah, why?
Cos you were talking really weird on the phone.
- Weird?
- Cryptic, short answers, like you were hiding something.
I wasn't hiding anything.
You want to know the truth?
Yeah.
Well, he was saying some stupid things, that's why.
Like what?
- Drama wanted to know if you woke me...
- Wait, Drama?
- I thought it was Turtle.
- Drama got on the phone and he wanted to know if you woke me up with a... you know.
You know.
He's an idiot that's why I was being cryptic.
I hate when my friends do stuff like that.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be crazy.
Don't be sorry.
I gotta jump in the shower.
- I know it's annoying, Vinnie.
- Do you?
Two guys following behind me, my every move.
You usually have three.
The only difference is your idiots aren't armed.
- You're always a help, Ari.
- I'm sorry, Vinnie.
It'll be over soon.
- Enjoy Darabont.
- I will.
- Later.
- Later.
- Morning, Mr Gold.
- Morning, slave.
I trust you heard that Adam Davies was promoted
- to the head of his talent department.
- I did.
And I was preparing to send him faeces.
- No?
- No, but I like the proactive thought.
- Just get him on the phone and Zac too.
- Zac who?
Zac Who-you-don't-get-to-know-his-name- because-you-are-a-peasant.
Oh good God, abs alert.
Don't whack off to the sound of his voice.
Chop chop.
What could you possibly want, Ari?
I just wanted to congratulate you on making it to the top of the Gestapo.
You really want anything?
- No, but your ex-client does.
- What ex-client?
- Connect him, Lloyd!
- Mr Efron, you're on with Mr Gold and Mr Davies.
- Hello.
- Zac!
Buddy, what's up?
You think you can leverage me, Adam?
What are you talking about?
You promised Disney I'd do a shirtless lunchbox if they gave The Rock
- an extra five mil for Witch 2.
- A shirtless lunchbox?
- No, it's not happening.
- Zac,
- that was a joke.
- You're a joke.
- Hold on, Adam.
- My girl here is a really big fan.
- Right?
- Hi, can I please have your autograph?
- Of course.
- Make it out to Lori.
- Zac, are you there?
- I'm sorry, are you in a rush, Adam?
- It's very nice to meet you, Lori.
- I'm Daryn.
I'm Lori.
It's nice to meet you.
Oh God.
- Are you still there, Adam?
- Yep.
Good.
You're fired.
- I'm with Ari now.
- Gut Yontif!
Beautiful work, Zac, beautiful.
You are now my new favourite client.
I cannot wait to get you a producer credit on College Musical.
That's hilarious, Ari.
How about a signing present?
Something with four wheels and leather seats.
Consider it done, my friend.
Later.
- Later.
- I'd buy that lunchbox, by the way.
I'm really sorry.
Ashley doesn't trust me.
I never had a girl that trusted me.
It sucks.
Yeah, but E's as trustworthy as they get.
- He's like a Toyota.
- I did lie to her about Sloan calling.
- Look, E, do you really like this girl?
- Yeah, I do.
Then you're gonna have to earn back her trust.
Never happen.
Girls have memories like elephants.
You get caught lying once, you're done, no matter what they tell you.
- What do you know about relationships?
- Everything.
I agree with Vince.
I think if you're a good guy you can prove it.
- Thank you.
- Please.
- Vincent!
- Hey.
You're looking good.
I like this look on you.
It's excellent.
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Frank.
Hey, Frank, how are you?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's makeup.
So are you getting ready, huh?
21 days.
I'm so excited.
I really want to get back to work.
You and me both.
The sets are almost completely rebuilt.
They're real...
Who are these guys?
We're having a bit of a security issue.
Don't worry, it won't affect the movie.
- Mr Chase?
- Yeah?
That was Aaron.
We momentarily lost track of our target.
- He would like you to come back home.
- How do you lose a tail?
It's OK.
I'll finish up the fitting.
Nothing's going to happen.
- Vince, what's going on?
- I think I might have a stalker.
- We don't know that yet.
- A stalker?
Not good, man, listen, after Shawshank came out, I got all these letters from convicts, most very complimentary, but there was this one guy, sent me like 50 letters saying that when he got out
he was going to Shawshank me in the ass.
Who couldn't love that movie?
- So what happened?
- The guy got paroled.
Sure enough, one day he shows up on my doorstep.
- Jesus.
- What'd you do?
- I shot him.
- Oh, Frank.
No, no, I'm serious.
I shot him in the ass.
Here.
- It's OK, he's a director.
- Relax, fellas, I know what I'm doing.
Safety's on, take this one.
I got a whole bunch more at home.
Oh no, we've already had a bit of a gun issue.
- Really?
- It was Turtle's fault.
- You sure?
- Yes, thank you.
All right, but I'm telling you something:
Shit like this is not to be trifled with, my friend.
My advice to you, listen to your Israelis.
Go home.
We can always do this fitting some other time, yeah?
- I could finish this up at the house.
- Vince?
- At the house will be fine.
- Wonderful.
At the house is fine.
Good, thank you, fellas.
Thank you, everybody.
Vince, seriously, paranoia.
That's all I'm saying.
Yeah.
Ari Gold's office.
- Lloyd, it's Adam Davies.
- Oh, hi.
- Let me see if I can get Mr Gold.
- I'm not calling for Ari, Lloyd.
I'm calling for you.
- Are you happy there?
- Happy?
How would you like to come work for me?
How would you like to finally be an agent?
- Is this so you can get back at Ari?
- No, Lloyd.
Getting back at Ari is the bonus.
- That's not great motivation for me.
- Three-year contract.
Triple what you're making, I'm sure.
Come in, we'll discuss.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
If that's a personal call you're on, Lloyd, I'm going to waterboard you.
- I have to go.
- Who was that?
- My mother.
- Ari!
Aaron Sorkin is signed, sealed and delivered.
Beautiful!
You hear that, Lloyd?
- Yes, congratulations.
- Now take a good look at this man.
All right, now what do you see in him that you don't see in yourself?
- I don't know.
- A purpose.
Now call your mother and tell her that you don't have one.
- All right?
Lunch?
- Great.
Slave, call the Grill and tell them we're on our way.
Ari Gold's office.
- Have you reconsidered yet, Lloyd?
- I'm happy here, really.
This offer won't last forever.
Tick tock.
How can I be calm when baby bro's safety is in the hands of inept gorillas?
- Please control your man, Eric.
- Would you calm down, please?
No, I can't calm down when we're locked up in here like wild animals.
You're not locked up.
You're free to leave whenever you want.
I don't get why you just didn't have this guy arrested in the first place.
Cos we have no actual proof it was him who broke in.
Then you should have had your goons stick him in the trunk
- and give him an Israeli-type warning.
- You watch too much TV!
Drama, would you let the professionals do their jobs, please?
Fine.
Do your job.
Thank you.
So what does this guy do anyway?
- He works in a retail shop.
- Which one?
Maybe we've crossed paths with him before.
Do you spend a lot of time in a place called the Pleasure Chest?
- Great mother of God.
- He does.
Do you have any idea how sick this guy is if he works at the Pleasure Chest?
Why?
You used to spend more time there than the employees.
Yeah, so what?
He's a stalker, I'm not.
He has an unlimited access to dildoes and restraints and this guy lost him!
But we have Vince which is most important.
I'm not feeling like you have anything.
You want me to make you feel something?
- Guys.
- Fine, fine.
I'll let the professionals do their job.
I'm gonna go take a nap.
That one is a loose cannon.
Pleasure Chest, this is Sadie.
Hey, Sadie, I don't know if you remember me?
I don't remember you, I won't have phone sex with you and I'm a lesbian.
- No, this is Johnny Chase.
We...
- Drama?
- Yeah!
- Holy shit, man.
How are you?
Good, good.
Haven't seen you since you made it big on the network.
Yeah, well, I can't really be rolling in there now that I'm a public figure.
Jeez, Drama, turn down the porn, will ya?
No, that's not porn.
- It's Vince.
- Oh, guess he's good.
- Yeah, he's great.
- Sweet.
So what's up?
Look, I wanted to ask you about an employee
- Curtis Tucker.
- What about him?
- What do you know about him?
Not much.
Quiet, keeps to himself.
Why?
I think he's got a hard-on for my baby bro.
Who doesn't?
No, not that kind of a hard-on.
More of a stalkerish nature.
Yeah, it wouldn't shock me.
Kid is creepy.
- Have you seen him?
- Not since yesterday, no.
But I think he switched shifts so he should be around at, like, 4:00.
Great.
Maybe I'll be there too.
You're not going to cause trouble now, are you, Drama?
- Would you like it if I did?
- You know it.
Although I am still recovering from you dislocating my pinkie at that SM seminar.
Maybe I'll make it up to you.
Ciao.
Hey.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Everything fit OK?
- Yeah.
- I gotta run to the set.
- OK.
- I thought you were taking a nap?
- Later!
- Later.
Tom, I don't know if it's a real offer or not.
- I'm just telling you what was said.
- Lloyd!
- I gotta go.
- Lloyd!
Coming, Mr Gold.
- Yes, sir.
- I spilled water all over my keyboard.
- Why?
- Because you were so busy,
- you accidentally knocked it over.
- No, because the only water that is available is in these stupid little cups.
No bottles.
Where are the bottles?
In the landfill.
You said you wanted to be more green.
That's because Leo was in earshot.
- I'll switch your keyboard right away.
- Good.
Wait till I'm out of the office before you get on your knees.
- Ari...
Mr Gold.
- What?
- You know it's been 50 days.
- 50 days.
You said 100 days of hell and then I'd be an agent.
It's been 50.
So I just want to make sure we're still on track.
- Still on track?
- That nothing's changed?
Are you seriously questioning me?
I'm just asking.
Because today I was offered a job.
- You were offered a job?
- A real job, Ari.
To be an agent, which of course is what I've always wanted, but to be an agent for you!
So I just want to make sure that I'm still going to be in 50 days.
- I just added 10 days.
- Ari, no!
- 10 more!
Want to keep questioning me?
- I just...
Or keep telling me about your other job opportunities?
- Ari!
- It's "Mr. Gold" for 70.
Now 80!
Or you can go ahead and represent dancing Chihuahuas or whatever your offer is.
Go ahead, keep questioning me.
I dare you.
- Please.
- 90 days.
This is not The Breakfast Club, Mr Gold, this is my life.
100 days.
You want 10 more?
- You just got 'em.
- For what?
For what you were thinking.
Now I've got chores for you when you're done cleaning up my keyboard.
Get my car, have it washed.
Go get my dry-cleaning, bring it to my house, clean up all the dogshit and my neighbour's.
Don't you ever question my word again!
- Go.
- Yes, sir.
- What do you mean they lost him?
- Just what I said.
Now they're following me around as if I'm the problem.
- Am I supposed to go home?
- No, no, no.
I got the situation under control.
I'm sure you do.
Did I look weird today?
Like I memorise you every morning.
What do you need, Drama?
I need you to call the house, tell Cohn that you need a man with you.
- Why?
- So I can give this perv a good old-fashioned New York warning.
- I...
- Hey.
- I'm Brooke.
- Hi.
- Turtle, are you listening to me?
- Yes.
- I have a homework question.
- Are you in my class?
No.
I'll ask you later.
- Ask me what?
- Stop socialising and call Aaron.
Do you really want to sit around and wait for this guy to come to us?
- What the hell?
- Is that what we are - passive pussies?
My break's over.
I've got to get to class.
- Come on, Turtle!
- Fine!
Later.
I'm coming as soon as your car is washed.
- You haven't done that yet?
- It's only been 30 minutes,
I'm moving as fast as I can.
If you had dropped the weight like I told you to, you'd be a little more aerodynamic.
I wanted to do it last so it was as fresh as possible.
Jesus Christ, 10 more days.
- Ari, why?
- Because you're weak, Lloyd.
- I am not.
- Don't cry.
I am not crying!
Because I will add a whole new lifetime if you start crying.
- I am not crying, Ari.
- It's "Mr Gold."
I'm not fucking crying, Mr Gold!
Oh my God!
- What happened?
- I've been hit.
- What?
- You've been hit, rear-ended.
- Oh God.
- Jesus Christ!
- Are you kidding me?
!
- Ari, it wasn't my fault.
Everything is your fault.
It's your fault because you accused me of crying when I wasn't and accused me of being weak when I'm not!
You're blaming me for you crashing my car?
I'm blaming you for ruining my life!
Get your ass back here before you say something you're going to regret.
I regret ever having met you, Ari Gold.
Your car is on Wilshire and Crescent waiting for you.
- You're abandoning it?
!
- Yes, and I'm abandoning you!
Lloyd?
Lloyd!
Lloyd!
Johnny Drama.
Hey, Sadie, good to see you.
You too.
What's up with your face?
- It's makeup.
- Sexy.
- Is he here yet?
- No, not yet.
- Why don't you browse?
- Cool.
I'll be in bondage.
I'll sneak away when I can.
- You want to double tonight?
- With who?
You and the clothing girl?
- She's cool.
- You've known her minutes.
- How do you know?
- Good instincts.
I think I gotta go alone.
I've got some work to do with Ashley.
Speaking of which.
Are your ears burning?
We were talking about you.
- Where are you?
- I'm at Vince's.
I thought you were gonna be at the office all day.
I thought so too, but something came up.
Where are you?
At your office.
- I wanted to surprise you.
- I'm sorry.
I met your assistant.
Vince, we've got a problem.
There's a problem here.
Can I call you back?
Yeah, sure!
- Bye.
- What happened?
Your crazy brother is inside the Pleasure Chest.
We've got sight of our main suspect.
He's pulling up there right now.
- I'm gonna call him.
- No, no, I'll call him.
Hey, Curtis.
How you doing?
All right.
What's going on?
Hello, Curtis, how are you?
I'm OK.
Do I know you?
- I don't know, do you?
- You look kind of familiar.
Walk with me, Curtis.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- All right, thanks.
I'll email you.
- All right.
Hey!
Sorry.
What's up?
I don't really have a homework question.
No, you just like to laugh at me?
I haven't been laughing at you.
They have.
I think you're really cute.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- So why are they laughing at me?
- They know things.
- Like what?
- Like that you live in quite the house.
- How do they know that?
- 1250 North Crossroads Drive.
What's that about?
- I have a roommate.
- And a dog.
And you prefer boxers to briefs.
What the hell is going on?
They're all wearing your underwear.
See?
Our rush chairman told us we had to steal
Jamie-Lynn Sigler's boyfriend's underwear.
Sorry.
- You broke in and stole my underwear?
- No, not me.
I only wear thongs.
- Vincent Chase!
- Vincent Chase.
- What about him?
- Admit it, you were at his house.
- I wasn't.
- You were.
And I found your licence to prove it.
I lost this licence years ago.
Where did you find it?
- In the couch!
- Where did you get the couch?
- What does it matter?
- HD Buttercup?
Yeah, maybe.
- How did you know?
- I used to sell furniture there.
- Maybe it fell in.
- Bullshit!
How long have you been stalking Vince?
Johnny, Vince is on the phone.
He says to tell you it was all a sorority prank on Turtle.
Here's my current licence.
It's not lost, see?
Who would have thought that a girl would want to get my underwear before Vince's?
Who would have thought anyone would want to get anywhere near your underwear?
Don't be bitter because I have more fans than you.
- You gonna tell Jamie?
- No.
Drama stopped the real stalker in my story.
- Good move.
- If he was the real one,
I would have stopped him.
Trust me.
Guys, what do you want to do tonight?
- Celebrate our freedom.
- E, you got Ashley?
- I called her, haven't heard back yet.
- I gotta work.
I don't think that face would do great in clubs anyway.
I think that makeup's bringing on some adult acne.
Right?
- I'm gonna kill you, Drama.
- You and what sorority sister?
So, listen, Vinnie, I'm glad it all worked out.
- So are you gonna join us out tonight?
- No can do.
Got a mess I'm dealing with here at the office.
- Everything OK?
- It will be.
- OK, talk later.
- All right, later.
Hi, Mr Gold.
I'm Craig.
HR sent me down to fill in for Lloyd.
Great.
I really look forward to helping you out.
- Do you know when he'll be back?
- You want the truth?
- Sure.
- He won't.
I killed him.
I shot him and I buried him underneath my desk.
- Any more questions?
- No.
Good.
Now get out of here before I kill you too.
(theme music playing)
(men laughing)
(speaking Hebrew)
(loud laughter)
Damn.
(loud chatter)
(woofs)
- (thumps)
- Oi!
- They woke you too?
- Yep.
You know that Big Yoni guy uses my toilet?
- Yep.
- And he leaves floaters!
- I didn't know that.
- What are we gonna do?
Talk to Aaron.
I called him, he's on his way.
- You seen my Fruit Loops?
- Nope.
Big Yoni's eating them outside.
- Turtle:
This guy's pushing me.
- Bagel Broker.
- Nice!
- What is with your face?
They surprised me with a new scene when I got to the set last night... battery acid sprays out of my car engine.
Four hours of makeup for one line, compliments of Dan Coakley.
- Why didn't you take it off?
- I've got to shoot again tonight.
I can't bear another session in the makeup chair.
- Now you've got two bad sides.
- Don't start with me, Turtle.
- I'm exhausted.
- Oh, you are?
!
We've got the Israeli army waking us up all night and you can go home!
Baby bro was hungry and you can go to Jamie's.
I'm a friend who doesn't leave his boy in crisis.
Appreciate that, Turtle.
Since Jamie's a little too scared to sleep here,
I'm having a little crisis of my own.
You've gone years without pussy, a couple days won't kill you.
- Shut your mouth, acid face!
- You want to go?
- Yeah, I do!
- Don't fucking get in my face.
- Whoa whoa whoa!
- You're disgusting.
- You boys okay?
- Actually no, we're not.
- He started it.
- One of your goons ate my Fruit Loops.
The same goon keeps pummeling my toilet.
- I'm sorry.
I'll talk to him.
- And I thought your man outside was gonna shoot me when I pulled up this morning.
- It's makeup.
- Aaron, I think everyone's a little tense with all the people around the house constantly.
How much longer do you think we're gonna have this much security?
I can scale it back if that's what you want.
But I think you should hear what we found on this guy before you make that decision.
- Here's a report.
He has a few arrests.
- He tried to kill his father?
As a child, he had an affinity for setting fires.
At the age of 12, he burned down his house, badly injuring his father.
He was questioned and cleared.
- Jesus.
- Creepy.
- We'll keep the security.
- It shouldn't be for much longer.
We have this guy under 24-hour surveillance.
- So what should we do?
- What you normally do.
- Well, I have a fitting today.
- No worries.
Live your life as usual.
My guys will be there just in case of any surprises.
- I'll be there too, bro.
- Appreciate it, Johnny.
- But lose the makeup, huh?
- No can do.
Okay.
Turtle, you want to come also?
- I got class.
- So much for you being a good friend.
- I have a perfect attendance record.
- It's okay, you go to class.
But do me a favor, call E, have him to meet me there
- because it looks like I have a ride.
- You got it, boss.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
- Yo, wake up.
- What time is it?
I don't know, 7-something.
- Are you alone?
- No.
- Ashley?
- Who else?
- With you, who knows?
- She wake you up with a morning BJ, E?
- Eric:
What's up?
- Drama:
Tell her she should.
What's up?
Vince wanted me to tell you to meet him at the fitting.
- Sounds good.
- Not as good as a morning BJ.
Okay, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.
- Who was that?
- It was Turtle.
Oh, what did he want?
Just to tell me that I have to meet Vince at the fitting.
I gotta get up.
Eric, was that... really Turtle?
Yeah, why?
'Cause you were talking really weird on the phone.
- Weird?
- Cryptic, short answers, like you were hiding something.
I wasn't hiding anything.
You want to know the truth?
Yeah.
Well, he was saying some stupid things, that's why.
Like what?
Like Drama wanted to know if you woke me up...
Wait.
Drama?
I thought it was Turtle.
Drama got on the phone and he wanted to know if you woke me up with a... you know.
- You know.
- Ahh.
He's an idiot that's why I was being cryptic.
I hate when my friends do stuff like that.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be crazy.
Don't be sorry.
I gotta jump in the shower.
(groans)
- I know it's annoying, Vinnie.
- Do you?
Two guys following behind me, my every move.
You usually have three.
The only difference is your idiots aren't armed.
- You're always a help, Ari.
- I'm sorry, Vinnie.
It'll be over soon.
- Enjoy Darabont.
- I will.
- Later.
- Later.
- Lloyd:
Morning, Mr. Gold.
- Morning, slave.
I trust you heard that Adam Davies was promoted
- to the head of his talent department.
- I did.
And I was preparing to send him feces.
- No?
- No, but I like the proactive thought.
- Just get him on the phone and Zac too.
- Zac who?
Zac Who-you-don't-get-to-know-his-name- because-you-are-a-peasant.
Oh good God, abs alert.
Don't whack off to the sound of his voice.
Chop chop.
What could you possibly want, Ari?
I just wanted to congratulate you on making it to the top of the Gestapo.
You really want anything?
- No, but your ex-client does.
- What ex-client?
- Connect him, Lloyd!
- Mr. Efron, you're on with Mr. Gold and Mr. Davies.
- Hello.
- Zac!
Buddy, what's up?
You think you can leverage me, Adam?
- What are you talking about?
- You promised Disney
I'd do a shirtless lunchbox if they gave The Rock
- an extra five mil for "Witch 2."
- A shirtless lunchbox?
- No, it's not happening.
- Davies:
Zac,
- that was a joke.
- You're a joke.
- Hold on, Adam.
- My girl here is a really big fan.
- Right?
- Hi, can I please have your autograph?
- Of course.
- Make it out to Lori.
- Zac, are you there?
- I'm sorry, are you in a rush, Adam?
- It's very nice to meet you, Lori.
- I'm Daryn.
I'm Lori.
It's nice to meet you.
Daryn:
Oh God.
- Are you still there, Adam?
- Yep.
Good.
You're fired.
- I'm with Ari now.
- Gut Yontif!
(phone beeps, disconnects)
Beautiful work, Zac, beautiful.
You are now my new favorite client.
I cannot wait to get you a producer credit on "College Musical."
That's hilarious, Ari.
How about a signing present?
Something with four wheels and leather seats.
Consider it done, my friend.
Later.
- Later.
- I'd buy that lunchbox, by the way.
I'm really sorry.
Ashley doesn't trust me.
I never had a girl that trusted me.
It sucks.
Yeah, but E's as trustworthy as they get.
- He's like a Toyota.
- I did lie to her about Sloan calling me.
- Look, E, do you really like this girl?
- Yeah, I do.
Then you're gonna have to earn back her trust.
Never happen.
Girls have memories like elephants.
You get caught lying once, you're done, no matter what they tell you.
- What do you know about relationships?
- Everything.
I agree with Vince.
I think if you're a good guy you can prove it.
- Thank you.
- Please.
- Vincent!
- Hey, Frank.
You're looking good.
I like this look on you.
It's excellent.
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Frank.
Hey, Frank, how are you?
- Yeah... yeah, it's makeup.
- Eew.
So are you getting ready, huh?
21 days.
I'm so excited.
I really want to get back to work.
You and me both.
The sets are almost completely rebuilt.
- (phone rings)
- They're real... who are these guys?
Eric:
Oh, we're having a bit of a security issue.
Don't worry, it won't affect the movie.
- Mr. Chase?
- Yeah?
That was Aaron.
We momentarily lost track of our target.
He would like you to come back home for the time being.
- How do you lose a tail?
- It's okay.
I'll finish up the fitting.
- Nothing's going to happen.
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- Vince, what's going on?
- I think I might have a stalker.
- Eric:
We don't know that yet.
- A stalker?
Not good, man, listen, after "Shawshank" came out, I got all these letters from convicts... most very complimentary, but there was this one guy, sent me like 50 letters saying that when he got out
he was going to Shawshank me in the ass.
Who couldn't love that movie?
- So what happened?
- The guy got paroled.
Sure enough, one day he shows up on my doorstep.
- Jesus.
- What'd you do?
- I shot him.
- (laughs) Oh, Frank.
No no, I'm serious.
I shot him in the ass.
- Here.
- Hey hey hey.
- It's okay, he's a director.
- Relax, fellas, I know what I'm doing.
Safety's on, take this one.
I got a whole bunch more at home.
Oh no, we've already had a bit of a gun issue.
- Really?
- It was Turtle's fault.
- You sure?
- Yes, thank you.
All right, but I'm telling you something:
Shit like this is not to be trifled with, my friend.
My advice to you, listen to your Israelis.
Go home.
We can always do this fitting some other time, yeah?
- I could finish this up at the house.
- Vince?
- At the house will be fine.
- Wonderful.
At the house is fine.
Good, thank you, fellas.
Thank you, everybody.
Vince, seriously, paranoia.
That's all I'm saying.
Yeah.
- (phone rings)
- Ari Gold's office.
- Lloyd, it's Adam Davies.
- Oh... hi.
Uh, let me see if I can get Mr. Gold.
I'm not calling for Ari, Lloyd.
- I'm calling for you.
- Oh.
- Are you happy there?
- Happy?
How would you like to come work for me?
How would you like to finally be an agent?
Would this be just so you could get back at Ari?
No, Lloyd.
Getting back at Ari is the bonus.
- That's not great motivation for me.
- Three-year contract.
Triple what you're making, I'm sure.
Come in, we'll discuss.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
If that's a personal call you're on, Lloyd, I'm going to waterboard you.
- I have to go.
- Who was that?
- My mother.
- Andrew:
Ari!
Aaron Sorkin is signed, sealed and delivered.
Beautiful!
You hear that, Lloyd?
- Yes, congratulations.
- Now take a good look at this man.
All right, now what do you see in him that you don't see in yourself?
I don't know.
- A purpose.
- (Andrew laughs)
Now call your mother and tell her that you don't have one.
- All right?
Lunch?
- Great.
Slave, call the Grill and tell them we're on our way.
- (phone rings)
- Ari Gold's office.
- Have you reconsidered yet, Lloyd?
- I'm happy here, really.
This offer won't last forever.
Tick tock.
How can I be calm when baby bro's safety is in the hands of inept gorillas?
- Please control your man, Eric.
- Would you calm down, please?
No, I can't calm down when we're locked up in here like wild animals.
You're not locked up.
You're free to leave whenever you want.
I don't get why you just didn't have this guy arrested in the first place.
'Cause we have no actual proof it was him who broke in.
Then you should have had your goons stick him in the trunk
- and give him an Israeli-type warning.
- You watch too much TV!
Drama, would you let the professionals do theirjobs, please?
Fine.
Do yourjob.
Thank you.
So what does this guy do anyway?
- He works in a retail shop.
- Which one?
Maybe we've crossed paths with him before.
Do you spend a lot of time in a place called the Pleasure Chest?
- Great mother of God.
- He does.
Do you have any idea how sick this guy must be if he works at the Pleasure Chest?
Why?
You used to spend more time there than the employees.
Yeah, so what?
He's a stalker, I'm not.
And he has an unlimited access to dildoes and restraints and this guy lost him!
But we have Vince which is most important.
I'm not feeling like you have anything.
You want me to make you feel something?
- Guys.
- Fine fine.
I'll let the professionals do theirjob.
I'm gonna go take a nap.
That one is a loose cannon.
(rings)
Pleasure Chest, this is Sadie.
Hey, Sadie, I don't know if you remember me?
I don't remember you, I won't have phone sex with you and I'm a lesbian.
- No no no, this is Johnny Chase.
We...
- Drama?
- Yeah!
- Holy shit, man.
How are you?
- Good good.
- Haven't seen you
- since you made it big on the network.
- Yeah, well, I can't really be rolling in there
- now that I'm a public figure.
- (moaning)
(scoffs) Jeez, Drama, turn down the porn, will ya?
- (moaning)
- No, that's not porn.
- It's Vince.
- Oh, guess he's good.
- Yeah, he's great.
- Sweet.
So what's up?
Look, I wanted to ask you about an employee...
Curtis Tucker.
- What about him?
- What do you know about him?
Not much.
Quiet, keeps to himself.
- Why?
- I think he's got a hard-on for my baby bro.
(snickers) Who doesn't?
No, not that kind of a hard-on.
More of a stalkerish nature.
Yeah, it wouldn't shock me.
Kid is creepy.
- Have you seen him?
- Not since yesterday, no.
But I think he switched shifts so he should be around at, like, 4:00.
Great.
Maybe I'll be there too.
You're not going to cause trouble, now are you, Drama?
- Would you like it if I did?
- You know it.
Although I am still recovering from you dislocating my pinkie at that SM seminar.
(laughs) Maybe I'll make it up to you.
Ciao.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Everything fit okay?
- Yeah.
- I gotta run to the set.
- Okay.
- I thought you were taking a nap?
- Later!
- Later.
Tom, I don't know if it's a real offer or not.
I'm just telling you what was said.
Lloyd!
- I gotta go.
- Lloyd!
Coming, Mr. Gold.
- Yes, sir.
- I just spilled water all over my keyboard.
- Why?
- Because you were so busy,
- you accidentally knocked it over.
- No, because the only water that is available is in these stupid little cups.
No bottles.
Where are the bottles?
In the landfill.
You said you wanted to be more green.
That's because Leo was in earshot.
- I will switch out your keyboard right away.
- Good.
Wait till I'm out of the office before you get on your knees.
- Ari...
Mr. Gold.
- What?
- You know it's been 50 days.
- 50 days.
You said 100 days of hell and then I'd be an agent.
It's been 50.
So I just want to make sure we're still on track.
- Still on track?
- That nothing's changed?
Are you seriously questioning me?
I'm just asking.
Because today I was offered a job.
- You were offered a job?
- A real job, Ari.
To be an agent, which of course is what I've always wanted... but to be an agent for you!
So I just want to make sure that I'm still going to be in 50 days.
- I just added 10 days.
- Ari, no!
10 more!
You want to keep questioning me?
- Ari, I just...
- Or keep telling me
- about your otherjob opportunities.
- Ari!
It's "Mr. Gold" for 70...
now 80!
Or you can go ahead and represent dancing Chihuahuas or whatever your offer is.
Go ahead, keep questioning me.
I dare you.
- Please.
- 90 days.
This is not "The Breakfast Club," Mr. Gold, this is my life.
100 days.
You want 10 more?
- You just got them.
- For what?
For what you were thinking.
Now I've got chores for you when you're done cleaning up my keyboard.
Get my car, have it washed.
Go get my dry cleaning, bring it to my house, clean up all the dogshit and my neighbor's.
Don't you ever question my word again!
- Go.
- Yes, sir.
- What do you mean they lost him?
- Drama:
Just what I said.
Now they're following me around as if I'm the problem.
- Am I supposed to go home?
- No no no.
I got the situation under control.
(giggles)
I'm sure you do.
Did I look weird today?
Like I memorize you every morning.
What do you need, Drama?
I need you to call the house, tell Cohn that you need a man with you.
- Why?
- So I can give this perv a good old-fashioned New York warning.
- L...
- Hey.
- I'm Brooke.
- Hi.
- Turtle, are you listening to me?
- Yes.
- I have a homework question.
- Are you in my class?
No.
I'll ask you later.
- Ask me what?
- Turtle, would you stop socializing and call Aaron?
Do you really want to sit around and wait for this guy to come to us?
- What the hell?
- Is that what we are... passive pussies?
My break's over.
I've got to get to class.
- Come on, Turtle!
- Fine!
Later.
I'm coming as soon as your car is washed.
- You haven't done that yet?
- It's only been 30 minutes, Mr. Gold.
I'm moving as fast as I can.
If you would have dropped the weight like I told you to, you'd be a little more aerodynamic.
I wanted to do it last so it was as fresh as possible.
Jesus Christ, 10 more days.
- Ari, why?
- Because you're weak, Lloyd.
- I am not.
- Don't cry.
- I am not crying!
- Because I will add a whole new lifetime if you start crying.
- I am not crying, Ari.
- It's "Mr. Gold."
I'm not fucking crying, Mr. Gold!
(shouts) Oh my God!
- What happened?
- I've been hit.
- What?
- You've been hit... rear-ended.
- Oh God.
- Jesus Christ!
- Are you kidding me?
!
- Ari, it wasn't my fault.
- Everything is your fault.
- It's your fault because you accused me of crying when I wasn't and accused me of being weak when I'm not!
You're blaming me for you crashing my car?
- I'm blaming you for ruining my life!
- (honking)
Get your ass back here before you say something you're going to regret.
I regret ever having met you, Ari Gold.
Your car is on Wilshire and Crescent waiting for you.
- You're abandoning it?
!
- Yes, and I'm abandoning you!
- Lloyd?
Lloyd!
- (honking)
(screams) Lloyd!
Johnny Drama.
Hey, Sadie, good to see you.
You too.
What's up with your face?
- It's makeup.
- Sexy.
- Is he here yet?
- No, not yet.
- Why don't you browse?
- Cool.
I'll be in bondage.
I'll sneak away when I can.
You want to double tonight?
With who?
You and the clothing girl?
- She's cool.
- You've known her for 20 minutes.
- How do you know?
- Good instincts.
I think I gotta go alone.
I've got some work to do with Ashley.
- (phone ringing)
- Speaking of which.
Are your ears burning?
We were talking about you.
- Where are you?
- I'm at Vince's.
I thought you were gonna be at the office all day.
Yeah, I thought so too, but something came up.
Where are you?
- At your office.
- Oh.
- I wanted to surprise you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I met your assistant.
Vince, we've got a problem.
There's a problem here.
Can I call you back?
Um... yeah, sure!
- Bye.
- What happened?
Your crazy brother is inside the Pleasure Chest.
We've got sight of our main suspect.
He's pulling up there right now.
- I'm gonna call him.
- No no, I'll call him.
(cell phone ringing)
Hey, Curtis.
How you doing?
All right.
What's going on?
Hello, Curtis, how are you?
I'm okay.
Do I know you?
I don't know, do you?
You look kind of familiar.
Walk with me, Curtis.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- All right, thanks.
I'll email you.
- All right, later.
Hey!
Sorry.
What's up?
I don't really have a homework question.
No, you just like to laugh at me?
I haven't been laughing at you.
They have.
I think you're really cute.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- So why are they laughing at me?
- They know things.
- Like what?
- Like that you live in quite the house.
- How do they know that?
- 1250 North Crossroads Drive.
What's that about?
- I have a roommate.
- And a dog.
And you prefer boxers to briefs.
What the hell is going on!
They're all wearing your underwear.
- See?
- Whoo!
Our rush chairman told us we had to steal Jamie-Lynn Sigler's boyfriend's underwear.
Sorry.
- You broke in and stole my underwear?
- No, not me.
I only wear thongs.
- Vincent Chase!
- Vincent Chase.
- What about him?
- Admit it, you were at his house.
- I wasn't.
- You were.
- And I found your license to prove it.
- (phone ringing)
I lost this license years ago.
Where did you find it?
- In the couch!
- Where did you get the couch?
- What does it matter?
- H.D. Buttercup?
Yeah, maybe.
- How did you know?
- I used to sell furniture there.
- Maybe it fell in.
- Bullshit!
How long have you been stalking Vince?
Sadie:
Uh, Johnny, Vince is on the phone.
He says to tell you it was all a sorority prank on Turtle.
Here's my current license.
It's not lost, see?
Oh.
- (laughing)
- Who would have thought that a girl would want to get in my underwear before Vince's?
Who would have thought anyone would have wanted to get anywhere near your underwear?
Don't be bitter because I have more fans than you.
- Eric:
You gonna tell Jamie?
- No.
Drama stopped the real stalker in my story.
- Good move.
- If he was the real one,
I would have stopped him.
Trust me.
Vince:
All right, guys, what do you want to do tonight?
- Celebrate our freedom.
- E, you got Ashley?
I called her, I haven't heard back yet.
- I gotta work.
- I don't think that face would do great in clubs anyway.
I think that makeup's bringing on some adult acne.
- Right?
- Oh ho ho!
- I'm gonna kill you, Drama.
- You and what sorority sister?
So, listen, Vinnie, I'm glad it all worked out.
So are you gonna join us out tonight?
Naw, no can do.
Got a mess I'm dealing with here at the office.
- Everything okay?
- It will be.
- Okay, talk later.
- All right, later.
Hi, Mr. Gold.
I'm Craig.
H.R. Sent me down to fill in for Lloyd.
Great.
I really look forward to helping you out.
Uh, do you know when he'll be back?
You want the truth?
- Sure.
- Uh, he won't.
I killed him.
I shot him and I buried him underneath my desk.
- Any more questions?
- Uh, no.
Good.
Now get out of here before I kill you too.

( men laughing )
( speaking hebrew )
( loud laughter )
Damn.
( loud chatter )
( woofs )
- ( thumps ) - oi!
- they woke you too?
- yep.
You know that big yoni guy uses my toilet?
- yep.
- and he leaves floaters!
- i didn't know that.
- what are we gonna do?
Talk to aaron.
i called him, he's on his way.
- you seen my fruit loops?
- nope.
Big yoni's eating them outside.
- turtle: this guy's pushing me.
- bagel broker.
- nice!
- what is with your face?
They surprised me with a new scene when i got to the set last night--
Battery acid sprays out of my car engine.
Four hours of makeup for one line, compliments of dan coakley.
- why didn't you take it off?
- i've got to shoot again tonight.
I can't bear another session in the makeup chair.
- now you've got two bad sides.
- don't start with me, turtle.
- i'm exhausted.
- oh, you are?
!
We've got the israeli army waking us up all night and you can go home!
Baby bro was hungry and you can go to jamie's.
- i'm a friend who doesn't leave his boy in crisis.
- appreciate that, turtle.
Since jamie's a little too scared to sleep here,
I'm having a little crisis of my own.
You've gone years without pussy, a couple days won't kill you.
- shut your mouth, acid face!
- you want to go?
- yeah, i do!
- don't fucking get in my face.
- whoa whoa whoa!
- you're disgusting.
- you boys okay?
- actually no, we're not.
- he started it.
- one of your goons ate my fruit loops.
The same goon keeps pummeling my toilet.
- i'm sorry. i'll talk to him.
- and i thought your man outside
Was gonna shoot me when i pulled up this morning.
- it's makeup.
- aaron, i think everyone's a little tense
With all the people around the house constantly.
How much longer do you think we're gonna have this much security?
I can scale it back if that's what you want.
But i think you should hear what we found on this guy before you make that decision.
- here's a report.
he has a few arrests.
- he tried to kill his father?
As a child, he had an affinity for setting fires.
At the age of 12, he burned down his house,
Badly injuring his father.
he was questioned and cleared.
- jesus.
- creepy.
- we'll keep the security.
- it shouldn't be for much longer.
We have this guy under 24-hour surveillance.
- so what should we do?
- what you normally do.
- well, i have a fitting today.
- no worries.
Live your life as usual.
my guys will be there just in case of any surprises.
- i'll be there too, bro.
- appreciate it, johnny.
- but lose the makeup, huh?
- no can do.
Okay. turtle, you want to come also?
- i got class.
- so much for you being a good friend.
- i have a perfect attendance record.
- it's okay, you go to class.
But do me a favor, call e, have him to meet me there
- because it looks like i have a ride.
- you got it, boss.
( phone ringing )
Hello?
- yo, wake up.
- what time is it?
i don't know, 7-something.
- are you alone?
- no.
- ashley?
- who else?
- with you, who knows?
- she wake you up with a morning b.j., e?
- eric: what's up?
- drama: tell her she should.
What's up?
Vince wanted me to tell you to meet him at the fitting.
- sounds good.
- not as good as a morning b.j.
Okay, i gotta go.
i'll talk to you later.
- who was that?
- it was turtle.
Oh, what did he want?
Just to tell me that i have to meet vince at the fitting.
I gotta get up.
Eric, was that...
Really turtle?
Yeah, why?
'cause you were talking really weird on the phone.
- weird?
- cryptic, short answers,
Like you were hiding something.
I wasn't hiding anything.
you want to know the truth?
Yeah.
Well, he was saying some stupid things, that's why.
Like what?
- like drama wanted to know if you woke me up-- - wait, drama?
- i thought it was turtle.
- drama got on the phone and he wanted to know
If you woke me up with a-- you know.
- you know.
- ahh.
He's an idiot that's why i was being cryptic.
I hate when my friends do stuff like that. i'm sorry, i don't mean to be crazy.
Don't be sorry.
i gotta jump in the shower.
( groans )
- i know it's annoying, vinnie.
- do you?
Two guys following behind me, my every move.
You usually have three.
the only difference is your idiots aren't armed.
- you're always a help, ari.
- i'm sorry, vinnie.
it'll be over soon.
- enjoy darabont.
- i will.
- later.
- later.
- lloyd: morning, mr. gold.
- morning, slave.
I trust you heard that adam davies was promoted
- to the head of his talent department.
- i did.
And i was preparing to send him feces.
- no?
- no, but i like the proactive thought.
- just get him on the phone and zac too.
- zac who?
Zac who-you-don't- get-to-know-his-name- because-you-are-a-peasant.
Oh good god, abs alert.
Don't whack off to the sound of his voice.
chop chop.
What could you possibly want, ari?
I just wanted to congratulate you
On making it to the top of the gestapo.
You really want anything?
- no, but your ex-client does.
- what ex-client?
- connect him, lloyd!
- mr. efron, you're on with mr. gold and mr. davies.
- hello.
- ...zac!
Buddy, what's up?
You think you can leverage me, adam?
- what are you talking about?
- you promised disney
I'd do a shirtless lunchbox if they gave the rock
- an extra five mil for "witch 2." - a shirtless lunchbox?
- no, it's not happening.
- davies: zac,
- that was a joke.
- you're a joke.
- hold on, adam.
- my girl here is a really big fan.
- right?
- hi, can i please have your autograph?
- of course.
- make it out to lori.
- zac, are you there?
- i'm sorry, are you in a rush, adam?
- it's very nice to meet you, lori.
- i'm daryn.
I'm lori.
it's nice to meet you.
daryn:
oh god.
- are you still there, adam?
- yep.
Good.
you're fired.
i'm with ari now.
- gut yontif!
( phone beeps, disconnects )
Beautiful work, zac, beautiful.
you are now my new favorite client.
I cannot wait to get you a producer credit on "college musical."
That's hilarious, ari.
how about a signing present?
Something with four wheels and leather seats.
Consider it done, my friend. later.
- later.
- i'd buy that lunchbox, by the way.
I'm really sorry.
Ashley doesn't trust me.
I never had a girl that trusted me.
it sucks.
Yeah, but e's as trustworthy as they get.
- he's like a toyota.
- i did lie to her about sloan calling me.
- look, e, do you really like this girl?
- yeah, i do.
Then you're gonna have to earn back her trust.
Never happen.
girls have memories like elephants.
You get caught lying once, you're done, no matter what they tell you.
- what do you know about relationships?
- everything.
I agree with vince.
i think if you're a good guy you can prove it.
- thank you.
- please.
- vincent!
- hey, frank.
You're looking good.
i like this look on you.
it's excellent.
- hey, eric.
- hey, frank.
Hey, frank, how are y?
- yeah-- yeah, it's makeup.
- eew.
So are you getting ready, huh?
21 days.
I'm so excited.
i really want to get back to work.
You and me both.
the sets are almost completely rebuilt.
- ( phone rings ) - they're real-- who are these guys?
eric:
oh, we're having a bit of a security issue.
Don't worry, it won't affect the movie.
- mr. chase?
- yeah?
That was aaron.
we momentarily lost track of our target.
- he would like you to come back home for the time being.
- how do you lose a tail?
It's okay.
i'll finish up the fitting.
- nothing's going to happen.
- whoa whoa whoa.
- vince, what's going on?
- i think i might have a stalker.
- eric: we don't know that yet.
- a stalker?
Not good, man, listen,
After "shawshank" came out, i got all these letters from convicts--
Most very complimentary, but there was this one guy,
Sent me like 50 letters saying that when he got out
He was going to shawshank me in the ass.
Who couldn't love that movie?
- so what happened?
- the guy got paroled.
Sure enough, one day he shows up on my doorstep.
- jesus.
- what'd you do?
- i shot him.
- ( laughs ) oh, frank.
No no, i'm serious.
i shot him in the ass.
- here.
- hey hey hey.
- it's okay, he's a director.
- relax, fellas, i know what i'm doing.
Safety's on, take this one.
i got a whole bunch more at home.
Oh no, we've already had a bit of a gun issue.
- really?
- it was turtle's fault.
- you sure?
- yes, thank you.
All right, but i'm telling you something:
Shit like this is not to be trifled with, my friend.
My advice to you, listen to your israelis.
Go home.
we can always do this fitting some other time, yeah?
- i could finish this up at the house.
- vince?
- at the house will be fine.
- wonderful. at the house is fine.
Good, thank you, fellas.
thank you, everybody.
Vince, seriously, paranoia.
That's all i'm saying.
Yeah.
- ( phone rings ) - ari gold's office.
- lloyd, it's adam davies.
- oh-- hi.
Uh, let me see if i can get mr. gold.
i'm not calling for ari, lloyd.
- i'm calling for you.
- oh.
- are you happy there?
- happy?
how would you like to come work for me?
How would you like to finally be an agent?
- would this be just so you could get back at ari?
- no, lloyd.
Getting back at ari is the bonus.
- that's not great motivation for me.
- three-year contract.
Triple what you're making, i'm sure.
come in, we'll discuss.
I'm sorry, but i can't do that.
If that's a personal call you're on, lloyd, i'm going to waterboard you.
- i have to go.
- who was that?
- my mother.
- andrew: ari!
Aaron sorkin is signed, sealed and delivered.
Beautiful!
you hear that, lloyd?
- yes, congratulations.
- now take a good look at this man.
All right, now what do you see in him that you don't see in yourself?
I don't know.
- a purpose.
- ( andrew laughs )
Now call your mother and tell her that you don't have one.
- all right?
lunch?
- great.
Slave, call the grill and tell them we're on our way.
- ( phone rings ) - ari gold's office.
- have you reconsidered yet, lloyd?
- i'm happy here, really.
This offer won't last forever.
tick tock.
How can i be calm when baby bro's safety is in the hands of inept gorillas?
- please control your man, eric.
- would you calm down, please?
No, i can't calm down when we're locked up in here like wild animals.
You're not locked up.
you're free to leave whenever you want.
I don't get why you just didn't have this guy arrested in the first place.
'cause we have no actual proof it was him who broke in.
Then you should have had your goons stick hhoin the trunk
- and give him an israeli-type warning.
- you watch too much tv!
Drama, would you let the professionals do their jobs, please?
Fine.
do your job.
Thank you.
so what does this guy do anyway?
- he works in a retail shop.
- which one?
maybe we've crossed paths with him before.
Do you spend a lot of time in a place called the pleasure chest?
- great mother of god.
- he does.
Do you have any idea how sick this guy must be if he works at the pleasure chest?
Why?
you used to spend more time there than the employees.
Yeah, so what?
he's a stalker, i'm not.
And he has an unlimited access to dildoes and restraints and this guy lost him!
but we have vince which is most important.
I'm not feeling like you have anything.
You want me to make you feel something?
- guys.
- fine fine.
I'll let the professionals do their job.
I'm gonna go take a nap.
That one is a loose cannon.
( rings )
Pleasure chest, this is sadie.
Hey, sadie, i don't know if you remember me?
I don't remember you, i won't have phone sex with you and i'm a lesbian.
- no no no, this is johnny chase. we-- - drama?
- yeah!
- holy shit, man.
how are you?
- good good.
- haven't seen you sinceou made it big on the network.
yeah, well, i can't really be rolling in there
- now that i'm a public figure.
- ( moaning )
( scoffs ) jeez, drama, turn down the porn, will ya?
- ( moaning ) - no, that's not porn.
- it's vince.
- oh, guess he's good.
- yeah, he's great.
- sweet. so what's up?
Look, i wanted to ask you about an employee-- curtis tucker.
- what about him?
- what do you know about him?
Not much.
quiet, keeps to himself.
- why?
- i think he's got a hard-on for my baby'sro.
( snickers ) who doesn't?
No, not that kind of a hard-on.
more of a stalkerish nature.
Yeah, it wouldn't shock me.
kid is creepy.
- have you seen him?
- not since yesterday, no.
But i think he switched shifts so he should be around at, like, 4:00.
Great.
maybe i'll be there too.
You're not going to cause trouble, now are you, drama?
- would you like it if i did?
- you know it.
Although i am still recovering from you
Dislocating my pinkie at that sm seminar.
( laughs ) maybe i'll make it up to you. ciao.
Hey.
Hey.
- hey.
- everything fit okay?
- yeah.
- i gotta run to the set.
- okay.
- i thought you were taking a nap?
- later!
- later.
Tom, i don't know if it's a real offer or not. i'm just telling you what was said.
Lloyd!
- i gotta go.
- lloyd!
Coming, mr. gold.
- yes, sir.
- i just spilled water all over my keyboard.
- why?
- because you were so busy, you accidentally knocked it over
No, because the only water that is available is in these stupid little cups.
No bottles.
where are the bottles?
In the landfill.
you said you wanted to be more green.
That's because leo was in earshot.
- i will switch out your keyboard right away.
- good.
Wait till i'm out of the office before you get on your knees.
- ari-- mr. gold.
- what?
- you know it's been 50 days.
- 50 days.
You said 100 days of hell and then i'd be an agent.
it's been 50.
So i just want to make sure we're still on track.
- still on track?
- that nothing's changed?
Are you seriously questioning me?
I'm just asking.
because today i was offered a job.
- you were offered a job?
- a real job, ari.
To be an agent, which of course is what i've always wanted--
But to be an agent for you!
so i just want to make sure
That i'm still going to be in 50 days.
- i just added 10 days.
- ari, no!
10 more!
you want to keep questioning me?
- ari, i just-- - or keep telling me about your other job opportunities.
- ari!
- it's "mr. gold" for 70-- now 80!
or you can go ahead and represent
Dancing chihuahuas or whatever your offer is.
Go ahead, keep questioning me.
i dare you.
- please.
- 90 days.
This is not "the breakfast club," mr. gold, this is my life.
100 days.
you want 10 more?
- you just got them.
- for what?
For what you were thinking.
Now i've got chores for you when you're done cleaning up my keyboard.
Get my car, have it washed.
go get my dry cleaning, bring it to my house,
Clean up all the dogshit and my neighbor's.
don't you ever question my word again!
- go.
- yes, sir.
- what do you mean they lost him?
- drama: just what i said.
Now they're following me around as if i'm the problem.
- am i supposed to go home?
- no no no.
I got the situation under control.
( giggling )
I'm sure you do.
did i look weird today?
Like i memorize you every morning.
What do you need, drama?
I need you to call the house,
Tell cohn that you need a man with you.
- why?
- so i can give this perv
A good old-fashioned new york warning.
- i-- - hey.
- i'm brooke.
- hi.
- turtle, are you listening to me?
- yes.
- i have a homework question.
- are you in my class?
No.
i'll ask you later.
- ask me what?
- turtle, will you stop sializing and call aaron?
do you really want to sit around and wait for this guy to come to us?
- what the hell?
- is that what we are-- passive pussies?
My break's over.
i've got to get to class.
- come on, turtle!
- fine!
later.
I'm coming as soon as your car is washed.
- you haven't done that yet?
- it's only been 30 minutes, mr. gold.
I'm moving as fast as i can.
If you would have dropped the weight like i told you to,
You'd be a little mo aerody.
I wanted to do it last so it was as fresh as possible.
Jesus christ, 10 more days.
- ari, why?
- because you're weak, lloyd.
- i am not.
- don't cry.
- i am not crying!
- because i will add
A whole new lifetime if you start crying.
- i am not crying, ari.
- it's "mr. gold."
I'm not fucking crying, mr. gold!
( shouts ) oh my god!
- what happened?
- i've been hit.
- what?
- you've been hit-- rear-ended.
- oh god.
- jesus christ!
- are you kidding me?
!
- ari, it wasn't my fault.
- everything is your fault.
- it's your fault
Because you accused me of crying when i wasn't
And accused me of being weak when i'm not!
You're blaming me for you crashing my car?
- i'm blaming you for ruining my life!
- ( honking )
Get your ass back here before you say something you're going to regret.
I regret ever having met you, ari gold.
Your car is on wilshire and crescent waiting for you.
- you're abandoning it?
!
- yes, and i'm abandoning you!
- lloyd?
lloyd!
- ( honking )
( screams ) lloyd!
Johnny drama.

- no, not yet.
- why don't you browse?
- cool.
I'll be in bondage.
I'll sneak away when i can.
You want to double tonight?
With who?
you and the clothing girl?
- she's cool.
- you've known her for 20 minutes.
- how do you know?
- good instincts.
I think i gotta go alone.
i've got some work to do with ashley.
- ( phone ringing ) - speaking of which.
Are your ears burning?
we were talking about you.
- where are you?
- i'm at vince's.
I thought you were gonna be at the office all day.
Yeah, i thought so too, but something came up.
where are you?
- at your office.
- oh.
- i wanted to surprise you.
- oh, i'm sorry.
I met your assistant.
Vince, we've got a problem.
There's a problem here.
can i call you back?
Um... yeah, sure!
- bye.
- what happened?
Your crazy brother is inside the pleasure chest.
We've got sight of our main suspect. he's pulling up there right now.
- i'm gonna call him.
- no no, i'll call him.
( cell phone ringing )
Hey, curtis.
how you doing?
All right.
what's going on?
Hello, curtis, how are you?
I'm okay.
do i know you?
I don't know, do you?
You look kind of familiar.
Walk with me, curtis.
i'd like to ask you a few questions.
- all right, thanks.
i'll email you.
- all right, later.
Hey!
sorry.
What's up?
I don't really have a homework question.
No, you just like to laugh at me?
I haven't been laughing at you.
they have.
I think you're really cute.
- really?
- yeah.
- so why are they laughing at me?
- they know things.
- like what?
- like that you live in quite the house.
- how do they know that?
- 1250 north crossroads drive.
What's that about?
- i have a roommate.
- and a dog.
And you prefer boxers to briefs.
What the hell is going on!
They're all wearing your underwear.
- see?
- whoo!
Our rush chairman told us we had to steal jamie-lynn sigler's boyfriend's underwear.
Sorry.
- you broke in and stole my underwear?
- no, not me.
I only wear thongs.
- vincent chase!
- vincent chase.
- what about him?
- admit it, you were at his house.
- i wasn't.
- you were.
- and i found your license to prove it.
- ( phone ringing )
I lost this license years ago.
where did you find it?
- in the couch!
- where did you get the couch?
- what does it matter?
- h.d. buttercup?
Yeah, maybe.
- how did you know?
- i used to sell furniture there.
- maybe it fell in.
- bullshit!
how long have you been stalking vince?
sadie:
uh, johnny, vince is on the phone.
He says to tell you it was all a sorority prank on turtle.
Here's my current license.
It's not lost, see?
Oh.
- ( laughing ) - who would have thought
That a girl would want to get in my underwear before vince's?
Who would have thought anyone would have wanted to get anywhere near your underwear?
Don't be bitter because i have more fans than you.
- eric: you gonna tell jamie?
- no.
Drama stopped the real stalker in my story.
- good move.
- if he was the real one, i would have stopped him.
- trust me.
- vince: all right, guys, what do you want to do tonight?
- celebrate our freedom.
- e, you got ashley?
I called her, i haven't heard back yet.
- i gotta work.
- i don't think that face would do great in clubs anyway.
I think that makeup's bringing on some adult acne.
- right?
- oh ho ho!
- i'm gonna kill you, drama.
- you and what sorority sister?
So, listen, vinnie, i'm glad it all worked out.
So are you gonna join us out tonight?
Naw, no can do.
got a mess i'm dealing with here at the office.
- everything okay?
- it will be.
- okay, talk later.
- all right, later.
Hi, mr. gold.
I'm craig.
H.r. sent me down to fill in for lloyd.
Great.
I really look forward to helping you out.
Uh, do you know when he'll be back?
You want the truth?
- sure.
- uh, he won't.
I killed him.
I shot him and i buried him underneath my desk.
- any more questions?
- uh, no.
Good.
now get out of here before i kill you too.
Damn.
- oi!
- they woke you too?
- yep.
You know that big yoni guy uses my toilet?
- yep.
- and he leaves floaters!
- i didn't know that.
- what are we gonna do?
Talk to aaron.
i called him, he's on his way.
- you seen my fruit loops?
- nope.
Big yoni's eating them outside.
- turtle: this guy's pushing me.
- bagel broker.
- nice!
- what is with your face?
They surprised me with a new scene when i got to the set last night--
Battery acid sprays out of my car engine.
Four hours of makeup for one line, compliments of dan coakley.
- why didn't you take it off?
- i've got to shoot again tonight.
I can't bear another session in the makeup chair.
- now you've got two bad sides.
- don't start with me, turtle.
- i'm exhausted.
- oh, you are?
!
We've got the israeli army waking us up all night and you can go home!
Baby bro was hungry and you can go to jamie's.
- i'm a friend who doesn't leave his boy in crisis.
- appreciate that, turtle.
Since jamie's a little too scared to sleep here,
I'm having a little crisis of my own.
You've gone years without pussy, a couple days won't kill you.
- shut your mouth, acid face!
- you want to go?
- yeah, i do!
- don't fucking get in my face.
- whoa whoa whoa!
- you're disgusting.
- you boys okay?
- actually no, we're not.
- he started it.
- one of your goons ate my fruit loops.
The same goon keeps pummeling my toilet.
- i'm sorry. i'll talk to him.
- and i thought your man outside
Was gonna shoot me when i pulled up this morning.
- it's makeup.
- aaron, i think everyone's a little tense
With all the people around the house constantly.
How much longer do you think we're gonna have this much security?
I can scale it back if that's what you want.
But i think you should hear what we found on this guy before you make that decision.
- here's a report.
he has a few arrests.
- he tried to kill his father?
As a child, he had an affinity for setting fires.
At the age of 12, he burned down his house,
Badly injuring his father.
he was questioned and cleared.
- jesus.
- creepy.
- we'll keep the security.
- it shouldn't be for much longer.
We have this guy under 24-hour surveillance.
- so what should we do?
- what you normally do.
- well, i have a fitting today.
- no worries.
Live your life as usual.
my guys will be there just in case of any surprises.
- i'll be there too, bro.
- appreciate it, johnny.
- but lose the makeup, huh?
- no can do.
Okay. turtle, you want to come also?
- i got class.
- so much for you being a good friend.
- i have a perfect attendance record.
- it's okay, you go to class.
But do me a favor, call e, have him to meet me there
- because it looks like i have a ride.
- you got it, boss.
( phone ringing )
Hello?
- yo, wake up.
- what time is it?
i don't know, 7-something.
- are you alone?
- no.
- ashley?
- who else?
- with you, who knows?
- she wake you up with a morning b.j., e?
- eric: what's up?
- drama: tell her she should.
What's up?
Vince wanted me to tell you to meet him at the fitting.
- sounds good.
- not as good as a morning b.j.
Okay, i gotta go.
i'll talk to you later.
- who was that?
- it was turtle.
Oh, what did he want?
Just to tell me that i have to meet vince at the fitting.
I gotta get up.
Eric, was that...
Really turtle?
Yeah, why?
'cause you were talking really weird on the phone.
- weird?
- cryptic, short answers,
Like you were hiding something.
I wasn't hiding anything.
you want to know the truth?
Yeah.
Well, he was saying some stupid things, that's why.
Like what?
- like drama wanted to know if you woke me up-- - wait, drama?
- i thought it was turtle.
- drama got on the phone and he wanted to know
If you woke me up with a-- you know.
- you know.
- ahh.
He's an idiot that's why i was being cryptic.
I hate when my friends do stuff like that. i'm sorry, i don't mean to be crazy.
Don't be sorry.
i gotta jump in the shower.
( groans )
- i know it's annoying, vinnie.
- do you?
Two guys following behind me, my every move.
You usually have three.
the only difference is your idiots aren't armed.
- you're always a help, ari.
- i'm sorry, vinnie.
it'll be over soon.
- enjoy darabont.
- i will.
- later.
- later.
- lloyd: morning, mr. gold.
- morning, slave.
I trust you heard that adam davies was promoted
- to the head of his talent department.
- i did.
And i was preparing to send him feces.
- no?
- no, but i like the proactive thought.
- just get him on the phone and zac too.
- zac who?
Zac who-you-don't- get-to-know-his-name- because-you-are-a-peasant.
Oh good god, abs alert.
Don't whack off to the sound of his voice.
chop chop.
What could you possibly want, ari?
I just wanted to congratulate you
On making it to the top of the gestapo.
You really want anything?
- no, but your ex-client does.
- what ex-client?
- connect him, lloyd!
- mr. efron, you're on with mr. gold and mr. davies.
- hello.
- ...zac!
Buddy, what's up?
You think you can leverage me, adam?
- what are you talking about?
- you promised disney
I'd do a shirtless lunchbox if they gave the rock
- an extra five mil for "witch 2." - a shirtless lunchbox?
- no, it's not happening.
- davies: zac,
- that was a joke.
- you're a joke.
- hold on, adam.
- my girl here is a really big fan.
- right?
- hi, can i please have your autograph?
- of course.
- make it out to lori.
- zac, are you there?
- i'm sorry, are you in a rush, adam?
- it's very nice to meet you, lori.
- i'm daryn.
I'm lori.
it's nice to meet you.
daryn:
oh god.
- are you still there, adam?
- yep.
Good.
you're fired.
i'm with ari now.
- gut yontif!
( phone beeps, disconnects )
Beautiful work, zac, beautiful.
you are now my new favorite client.
I cannot wait to get you a producer credit on "college musical."
That's hilarious, ari.
how about a signing present?
Something with four wheels and leather seats.
Consider it done, my friend. later.
- later.
- i'd buy that lunchbox, by the way.
I'm really sorry.
Ashley doesn't trust me.
I never had a girl that trusted me.
it sucks.
Yeah, but e's as trustworthy as they get.
- he's like a toyota.
- i did lie to her about sloan calling me.
- look, e, do you really like this girl?
- yeah, i do.
Then you're gonna have to earn back her trust.
Never happen.
girls have memories like elephants.
You get caught lying once, you're done, no matter what they tell you.
- what do you know about relationships?
- everything.
I agree with vince.
i think if you're a good guy you can prove it.
- thank you.
- please.
- vincent!
- hey, frank.
You're looking good.
i like this look on you.
it's excellent.
- hey, eric.
- hey, frank.
Hey, frank, how are y?
- yeah-- yeah, it's makeup.
- eew.
So are you getting ready, huh?
21 days.
I'm so excited.
i really want to get back to work.
You and me both.
the sets are almost completely rebuilt.
- ( phone rings ) - they're real-- who are these guys?
eric:
oh, we're having a bit of a security issue.
Don't worry, it won't affect the movie.
- mr. chase?
- yeah?
That was aaron.
we momentarily lost track of our target.
- he would like you to come back home for the time being.
- how do you lose a tail?
It's okay.
i'll finish up the fitting.
- nothing's going to happen.
- whoa whoa whoa.
- vince, what's going on?
- i think i might have a stalker.
- eric: we don't know that yet.
- a stalker?
Not good, man, listen,
After "shawshank" came out, i got all these letters from convicts--
Most very complimentary, but there was this one guy,
Sent me like 50 letters saying that when he got out
He was going to shawshank me in the ass.
Who couldn't love that movie?
- so what happened?
- the guy got paroled.
Sure enough, one day he shows up on my doorstep.
- jesus.
- what'd you do?
- i shot him.
- ( laughs ) oh, frank.
No no, i'm serious.
i shot him in the ass.
- here.
- hey hey hey.
- it's okay, he's a director.
- relax, fellas, i know what i'm doing.
Safety's on, take this one.
i got a whole bunch more at home.
Oh no, we've already had a bit of a gun issue.
- really?
- it was turtle's fault.
- you sure?
- yes, thank you.
All right, but i'm telling you something:
Shit like this is not to be trifled with, my friend.
My advice to you, listen to your israelis.
Go home.
we can always do this fitting some other time, yeah?
- i could finish this up at the house.
- vince?
- at the house will be fine.
- wonderful. at the house is fine.
Good, thank you, fellas.
thank you, everybody.
Vince, seriously, paranoia.
That's all i'm saying.
Yeah.
- ( phone rings ) - ari gold's office.
- lloyd, it's adam davies.
- oh-- hi.
Uh, let me see if i can get mr. gold.
i'm not calling for ari, lloyd.
- i'm calling for you.
- oh.
- are you happy there?
- happy?
how would you like to come work for me?
How would you like to finally be an agent?
- would this be just so you could get back at ari?
- no, lloyd.
Getting back at ari is the bonus.
- that's not great motivation for me.
- three-year contract.
Triple what you're making, i'm sure.
come in, we'll discuss.
I'm sorry, but i can't do that.
If that's a personal call you're on, lloyd, i'm going to waterboard you.
- i have to go.
- who was that?
- my mother.
- andrew: ari!
Aaron sorkin is signed, sealed and delivered.
Beautiful!
you hear that, lloyd?
- yes, congratulations.
- now take a good look at this man.
All right, now what do you see in him that you don't see in yourself?
I don't know.
- a purpose.
- ( andrew laughs )
Now call your mother and tell her that you don't have one.
- all right?
lunch?
- great.
Slave, call the grill and tell them we're on our way.
- ( phone rings ) - ari gold's office.
- have you reconsidered yet, lloyd?
- i'm happy here, really.
This offer won't last forever.
tick tock.
How can i be calm when baby bro's safety is in the hands of inept gorillas?
- please control your man, eric.
- would you calm down, please?
No, i can't calm down when we're locked up in here like wild animals.
You're not locked up.
you're free to leave whenever you want.
I don't get why you just didn't have this guy arrested in the first place.
'cause we have no actual proof it was him who broke in.
Then you should have had your goons stick hhoin the trunk
- and give him an israeli-type warning.
- you watch too much tv!
Drama, would you let the professionals do their jobs, please?
Fine.
do your job.
Thank you.
so what does this guy do anyway?
- he works in a retail shop.
- which one?
maybe we've crossed paths with him before.
Do you spend a lot of time in a place called the pleasure chest?
- great mother of god.
- he does.
Do you have any idea how sick this guy must be if he works at the pleasure chest?
Why?
you used to spend more time there than the employees.
Yeah, so what?
he's a stalker, i'm not.
And he has an unlimited access to dildoes and restraints and this guy lost him!
but we have vince which is most important.
I'm not feeling like you have anything.
You want me to make you feel something?
- guys.
- fine fine.
I'll let the professionals do their job.
I'm gonna go take a nap.
That one is a loose cannon.
( rings )
Pleasure chest, this is sadie.
Hey, sadie, i don't know if you remember me?
I don't remember you, i won't have phone sex with you and i'm a lesbian.
- no no no, this is johnny chase. we-- - drama?
- yeah!
- holy shit, man.
how are you?
- good good.
- haven't seen you sinceou made it big on the network.
yeah, well, i can't really be rolling in there
- now that i'm a public figure.
- ( moaning )
( scoffs ) jeez, drama, turn down the porn, will ya?
- ( moaning ) - no, that's not porn.
- it's vince.
- oh, guess he's good.
- yeah, he's great.
- sweet. so what's up?
Look, i wanted to ask you about an employee-- curtis tucker.
- what about him?
- what do you know about him?
Not much.
quiet, keeps to himself.
- why?
- i think he's got a hard-on for my baby'sro.
( snickers ) who doesn't?
No, not that kind of a hard-on.
more of a stalkerish nature.
Yeah, it wouldn't shock me.
kid is creepy.
- have you seen him?
- not since yesterday, no.
But i think he switched shifts so he should be around at, like, 4:00.
Great.
maybe i'll be there too.
You're not going to cause trouble, now are you, drama?
- would you like it if i did?
- you know it.
Although i am still recovering from you
Dislocating my pinkie at that sm seminar.
( laughs ) maybe i'll make it up to you. ciao.
Hey.
Hey.
- hey.
- everything fit okay?
- yeah.
- i gotta run to the set.
- okay.
- i thought you were taking a nap?
- later!
- later.
Tom, i don't know if it's a real offer or not. i'm just telling you what was said.
Lloyd!
- i gotta go.
- lloyd!
Coming, mr. gold.
- yes, sir.
- i just spilled water all over my keyboard.
- why?
- because you were so busy, you accidentally knocked it over
No, because the only water that is available is in these stupid little cups.
No bottles.
where are the bottles?
In the landfill.
you said you wanted to be more green.
That's because leo was in earshot.
- i will switch out your keyboard right away.
- good.
Wait till i'm out of the office before you get on your knees.
- ari-- mr. gold.
- what?
- you know it's been 50 days.
- 50 days.
You said 100 days of hell and then i'd be an agent.
it's been 50.
So i just want to make sure we're still on track.
- still on track?
- that nothing's changed?
Are you seriously questioning me?
I'm just asking.
because today i was offered a job.
- you were offered a job?
- a real job, ari.
To be an agent, which of course is what i've always wanted--
But to be an agent for you!
so i just want to make sure
That i'm still going to be in 50 days.
- i just added 10 days.
- ari, no!
10 more!
you want to keep questioning me?
- ari, i just-- - or keep telling me about your other job opportunities.
- ari!
- it's "mr. gold" for 70-- now 80!
or you can go ahead and represent
Dancing chihuahuas or whatever your offer is.
Go ahead, keep questioning me.
i dare you.
- please.
- 90 days.
This is not "the breakfast club," mr. gold, this is my life.
100 days.
you want 10 more?
- you just got them.
- for what?
For what you were thinking.
Now i've got chores for you when you're done cleaning up my keyboard.
Get my car, have it washed.
go get my dry cleaning, bring it to my house,
Clean up all the dogshit and my neighbor's.
don't you ever question my word again!
- go.
- yes, sir.
- what do you mean they lost him?
- drama: just what i said.
Now they're following me around as if i'm the problem.
- am i supposed to go home?
- no no no.
I got the situation under control.
( giggling )
I'm sure you do.
did i look weird today?
Like i memorize you every morning.
What do you need, drama?
I need you to call the house,
Tell cohn that you need a man with you.
- why?
- so i can give this perv
A good old-fashioned new york warning.
- i-- - hey.
- i'm brooke.
- hi.
- turtle, are you listening to me?
- yes.
- i have a homework question.
- are you in my class?
No.
i'll ask you later.
- ask me what?
- turtle, will you stop sializing and call aaron?
do you really want to sit around and wait for this guy to come to us?
- what the hell?
- is that what we are-- passive pussies?
My break's over.
i've got to get to class.
- come on, turtle!
- fine!
later.
I'm coming as soon as your car is washed.
- you haven't done that yet?
- it's only been 30 minutes, mr. gold.
I'm moving as fast as i can.
If you would have dropped the weight like i told you to,
You'd be a little mo aerody.
I wanted to do it last so it was as fresh as possible.
Jesus christ, 10 more days.
- ari, why?
- because you're weak, lloyd.
- i am not.
- don't cry.
- i am not crying!
- because i will add
A whole new lifetime if you start crying.
- i am not crying, ari.
- it's "mr. gold."
I'm not fucking crying, mr. gold!
( shouts ) oh my god!
- what happened?
- i've been hit.
- what?
- you've been hit-- rear-ended.
- oh god.
- jesus christ!
- are you kidding me?
!
- ari, it wasn't my fault.
- everything is your fault.
- it's your fault
Because you accused me of crying when i wasn't
And accused me of being weak when i'm not!
You're blaming me for you crashing my car?
- i'm blaming you for ruining my life!
- ( honking )
Get your ass back here before you say something you're going to regret.
I regret ever having met you, ari gold.
Your car is on wilshire and crescent waiting for you.
- you're abandoning it?
!
- yes, and i'm abandoning you!
- lloyd?
lloyd!
- ( honking )
( screams ) lloyd!

- ( phone ringing ) - speaking of which.
Are your ears burning?
we were talking about you.
- where are you?
- i'm at vince's.
I thought you were gonna be at the office all day.
Yeah, i thought so too, but something came up.
where are you?
- at your office.
- oh.
- i wanted to surprise you.
- oh, i'm sorry.
I met your assistant.
Vince, we've got a problem.
There's a problem here.

Um... yeah, sure!

Your crazy brother is inside the pleasure chest.
We've got sight of our main suspect. he's pulling up there right now.

( cell phone ringing )
Hey, curtis.

All right.

Hello, curtis, how are you?
I'm okay.

I don't know, do you?
You look kind of familiar.
Walk with me, curtis.
i'd like to ask you a few questions.
- all right, thanks.
i'll email you.
- all right, later.
Hey!
sorry.
What's up?
I don't really have a homework question.
No, you just like to laugh at me?
I haven't been laughing at you.

I think you're really cute.
- really?
- yeah.
- so why are they laughing at me?
- they know things.
- like what?
- like that you live in quite the house.
- how do they know that?
- 1250 north crossroads drive.
What's that about?
- i have a roommate.
- and a dog.
And you prefer boxers to briefs.
What the hell is going on!
They're all wearing your underwear.
- see?
- whoo!
Our rush chairman told us we had to steal jamie-lynn sigler's boyfriend's underwear.
Sorry.
- you broke in and stole my underwear?
- no, not me.
I only wear thongs.
- vincent chase!
- vincent chase.
- what about him?
- admit it, you were at his house.
- i wasn't.
- you were.
- and i found your license to prove it.
- ( phone ringing )
I lost this license years ago.
where did you find it?
- in the couch!
- where did you get the couch?
- what does it matter?
- h.d. buttercup?
Yeah, maybe.
- how did you know?
- i used to sell furniture there.
- maybe it fell in.
- bullshit!
how long have you been stalking vince?
sadie:
uh, johnny, vince is on the phone.
He says to tell you it was all a sorority prank on turtle.
Here's my current license.
It's not lost, see?
Oh.
- ( laughing ) - who would have thought
That a girl would want to get in my underwear before vince's?
Who would have thought anyone would have wanted to get anywhere near your underwear?
Don't be bitter because i have more fans than you.
- eric: you gonna tell jamie?
- no.
Drama stopped the real stalker in my story.
- good move.
- if he was the real one, i would have stopped him.
- trust me.
- vince: all right, guys, what do you want to do tonight?
- celebrate our freedom.
- e, you got ashley?
I called her, i haven't heard back yet.
- i gotta work.
- i don't think that face would do great in clubs anyway.
I think that makeup's bringing on some adult acne.
- right?
- oh ho ho!
- i'm gonna kill you, drama.
- you and what sorority sister?
So, listen, vinnie, i'm glad it all worked out.
So are you gonna join us out tonight?
Naw, no can do.
got a mess i'm dealing with here at the office.
- everything okay?
- it will be.
- okay, talk later.
- all right, later.
Hi, mr. gold.
I'm craig.
H.r. sent me down to fill in for lloyd.
Great.
I really look forward to helping you out.
Uh, do you know when he'll be back?
You want the truth?
- sure.
- uh, he won't.
I killed him.
I shot him and i buried him underneath my desk.
- any more questions?
- uh, no.
Good.
now get out of here before i kill you too.
Damn.
- They woke you too?
- Yep.
You know that Big Yoni guy uses my toilet?
- Yep.
- And he leaves floaters!
- I didn't know that.
- What are we gonna do?
Talk to Aaron.
I called him, he's on his way.
- You seen my Fruit Loops?
- Nope.
Big Yoni's eating them outside.
- This guy's pushing me.
- Bagel Broker.
- Nice!
- What is with your face?
They surprised me with a new scene when I got to the set last night - battery acid sprays out of my car engine.
Four hours of makeup for one line, compliments of Dan Coakley.
- Why didn't you take it off?
- I've got to shoot again tonight.
I can't bear another session in the makeup chair.
- Now you've got two bad sides.
- Don't start with me, Turtle.
- I'm exhausted.
- Oh, you are?
!
We've got the Israeli army waking us up all night and you can go home!
Baby bro was hungry and you can go to Jamie's.
I'm a friend who doesn't leave his boy in crisis.
Appreciate that, Turtle.
Since Jamie's too scared to sleep here,
I'm having a little crisis of my own.
You've gone years without pussy, a couple days won't kill you.
- Shut your mouth, acid face!
- You want to go?
- Yeah, I do!
- Don't fucking get in my face.
You're disgusting.
- You boys OK?
- Actually no, we're not.
- He started it.
- One of your goons ate my Fruit Loops.
The same goon keeps pummelling my toilet.
- I'm sorry.
I'll talk to him.
- And I thought your man outside was gonna shoot me when I pulled up this morning.
- It's makeup.
- Aaron, everyone's a little tense with all the people around the house constantly.
How much longer do you think we'll have this much security?
I can scale it back if that's what you want.
But you should hear what we found on this guy before you make that decision.
- Here's a report.
He has a few arrests.
- He tried to kill his father?
As a child, he had an affinity for setting fires.
At the age of 12, he burned down his house, badly injuring his father.
He was questioned and cleared.
- Jesus.
- Creepy.
- We'll keep the security.
- It shouldn't be for much longer.
We have this guy under 24-hour surveillance.
- So what should we do?
- What you normally do.
- Well, I have a fitting today.
- No worries.
Live your life as usual.
My guys will be there just in case of any surprises.
- I'll be there too, bro.
- Appreciate it, Johnny.
- But lose the makeup, huh?
- No can do.
OK.
Turtle, you want to come also?
- I got class.
- So much for you being a good friend.
- I have a perfect attendance record.
- It's OK, you go to class.
But do me a favour, call E, have him meet me there
- because it looks like I have a ride.
- You got it, boss.
Hello?
- Yo, wake up.
- What time is it?
I don't know, seven-something.
- Are you alone?
- No.
- Ashley?
- Who else?
- With you, who knows?
- She wake you up with a BJ, E?
- What's up?
- Tell her she should.
What's up?
Vince wanted me to tell you to meet him at the fitting.
- Sounds good.
- Not as good as a morning BJ.
OK, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.
- Who was that?
- It was Turtle.
Oh, what did he want?
Just to tell me that I have to meet Vince at the fitting.
I gotta get up.
Eric, was that... really Turtle?
Yeah, why?
Cos you were talking really weird on the phone.
- Weird?
- Cryptic, short answers, like you were hiding something.
I wasn't hiding anything.
You want to know the truth?
Yeah.
Well, he was saying some stupid things, that's why.
Like what?
- Drama wanted to know if you woke me...
- Wait, Drama?
- I thought it was Turtle.
- Drama got on the phone and he wanted to know if you woke me up with a... you know.
You know.
He's an idiot that's why I was being cryptic.
I hate when my friends do stuff like that.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be crazy.
Don't be sorry.
I gotta jump in the shower.
- I know it's annoying, Vinnie.
- Do you?
Two guys following behind me, my every move.
You usually have three.
The only difference is your idiots aren't armed.
- You're always a help, Ari.
- I'm sorry, Vinnie.
It'll be over soon.
- Enjoy Darabont.
- I will.
- Later.
- Later.
- Morning, Mr Gold.
- Morning, slave.
I trust you heard that Adam Davies was promoted
- to the head of his talent department.
- I did.
And I was preparing to send him faeces.
- No?
- No, but I like the proactive thought.
- Just get him on the phone and Zac too.
- Zac who?
Zac Who-you-don't-get-to-know-his-name- because-you-are-a-peasant.
Oh good God, abs alert.
Don't whack off to the sound of his voice.
Chop chop.
What could you possibly want, Ari?
I just wanted to congratulate you on making it to the top of the Gestapo.
You really want anything?
- No, but your ex-client does.
- What ex-client?
- Connect him, Lloyd!
- Mr Efron, you're on with Mr Gold and Mr Davies.
- Hello.
- Zac!
Buddy, what's up?
You think you can leverage me, Adam?
What are you talking about?
You promised Disney I'd do a shirtless lunchbox if they gave The Rock
- an extra five mil for Witch 2.
- A shirtless lunchbox?
- No, it's not happening.
- Zac,
- that was a joke.
- You're a joke.
- Hold on, Adam.
- My girl here is a really big fan.
- Right?
- Hi, can I please have your autograph?
- Of course.
- Make it out to Lori.
- Zac, are you there?
- I'm sorry, are you in a rush, Adam?
- It's very nice to meet you, Lori.
- I'm Daryn.
I'm Lori.
It's nice to meet you.
Oh God.
- Are you still there, Adam?
- Yep.
Good.
You're fired.
- I'm with Ari now.
- Gut Yontif!
Beautiful work, Zac, beautiful.
You are now my new favourite client.
I cannot wait to get you a producer credit on College Musical.
That's hilarious, Ari.
How about a signing present?
Something with four wheels and leather seats.
Consider it done, my friend.
Later.
- Later.
- I'd buy that lunchbox, by the way.
I'm really sorry.
Ashley doesn't trust me.
I never had a girl that trusted me.
It sucks.
Yeah, but E's as trustworthy as they get.
- He's like a Toyota.
- I did lie to her about Sloan calling.
- Look, E, do you really like this girl?
- Yeah, I do.
Then you're gonna have to earn back her trust.
Never happen.
Girls have memories like elephants.
You get caught lying once, you're done, no matter what they tell you.
- What do you know about relationships?
- Everything.
I agree with Vince.
I think if you're a good guy you can prove it.
- Thank you.
- Please.
- Vincent!
- Hey.
You're looking good.
I like this look on you.
It's excellent.
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Frank.
Hey, Frank, how are you?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's makeup.
So are you getting ready, huh?
21 days.
I'm so excited.
I really want to get back to work.
You and me both.
The sets are almost completely rebuilt.
They're real...
Who are these guys?
We're having a bit of a security issue.
Don't worry, it won't affect the movie.
- Mr Chase?
- Yeah?
That was Aaron.
We momentarily lost track of our target.
- He would like you to come back home.
- How do you lose a tail?
It's OK.
I'll finish up the fitting.
Nothing's going to happen.
- Vince, what's going on?
- I think I might have a stalker.
- We don't know that yet.
- A stalker?
Not good, man, listen, after Shawshank came out, I got all these letters from convicts, most very complimentary, but there was this one guy, sent me like 50 letters saying that when he got out
he was going to Shawshank me in the ass.
Who couldn't love that movie?
- So what happened?
- The guy got paroled.
Sure enough, one day he shows up on my doorstep.
- Jesus.
- What'd you do?
- I shot him.
- Oh, Frank.
No, no, I'm serious.
I shot him in the ass.
Here.
- It's OK, he's a director.
- Relax, fellas, I know what I'm doing.
Safety's on, take this one.
I got a whole bunch more at home.
Oh no, we've already had a bit of a gun issue.
- Really?
- It was Turtle's fault.
- You sure?
- Yes, thank you.
All right, but I'm telling you something:
Shit like this is not to be trifled with, my friend.
My advice to you, listen to your Israelis.
Go home.
We can always do this fitting some other time, yeah?
- I could finish this up at the house.
- Vince?
- At the house will be fine.
- Wonderful.
At the house is fine.
Good, thank you, fellas.
Thank you, everybody.
Vince, seriously, paranoia.
That's all I'm saying.
Yeah.
Ari Gold's office.
- Lloyd, it's Adam Davies.
- Oh, hi.
- Let me see if I can get Mr Gold.
- I'm not calling for Ari, Lloyd.
I'm calling for you.
- Are you happy there?
- Happy?
How would you like to come work for me?
How would you like to finally be an agent?
- Is this so you can get back at Ari?
- No, Lloyd.
Getting back at Ari is the bonus.
- That's not great motivation for me.
- Three-year contract.
Triple what you're making, I'm sure.
Come in, we'll discuss.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
If that's a personal call you're on, Lloyd, I'm going to waterboard you.
- I have to go.
- Who was that?
- My mother.
- Ari!
Aaron Sorkin is signed, sealed and delivered.
Beautiful!
You hear that, Lloyd?
- Yes, congratulations.
- Now take a good look at this man.
All right, now what do you see in him that you don't see in yourself?
- I don't know.
- A purpose.
Now call your mother and tell her that you don't have one.
- All right?
Lunch?
- Great.
Slave, call the Grill and tell them we're on our way.
Ari Gold's office.
- Have you reconsidered yet, Lloyd?
- I'm happy here, really.
This offer won't last forever.
Tick tock.
How can I be calm when baby bro's safety is in the hands of inept gorillas?
- Please control your man, Eric.
- Would you calm down, please?
No, I can't calm down when we're locked up in here like wild animals.
You're not locked up.
You're free to leave whenever you want.
I don't get why you just didn't have this guy arrested in the first place.
Cos we have no actual proof it was him who broke in.
Then you should have had your goons stick him in the trunk
- and give him an Israeli-type warning.
- You watch too much TV!
Drama, would you let the professionals do their jobs, please?
Fine.
Do your job.
Thank you.
So what does this guy do anyway?
- He works in a retail shop.
- Which one?
Maybe we've crossed paths with him before.
Do you spend a lot of time in a place called the Pleasure Chest?
- Great mother of God.
- He does.
Do you have any idea how sick this guy is if he works at the Pleasure Chest?
Why?
You used to spend more time there than the employees.
Yeah, so what?
He's a stalker, I'm not.
He has an unlimited access to dildoes and restraints and this guy lost him!
But we have Vince which is most important.
I'm not feeling like you have anything.
You want me to make you feel something?
- Guys.
- Fine, fine.
I'll let the professionals do their job.
I'm gonna go take a nap.
That one is a loose cannon.
Pleasure Chest, this is Sadie.
Hey, Sadie, I don't know if you remember me?
I don't remember you, I won't have phone sex with you and I'm a lesbian.
- No, this is Johnny Chase.
We...
- Drama?
- Yeah!
- Holy shit, man.
How are you?
Good, good.
Haven't seen you since you made it big on the network.
Yeah, well, I can't really be rolling in there now that I'm a public figure.
Jeez, Drama, turn down the porn, will ya?
No, that's not porn.
- It's Vince.
- Oh, guess he's good.
- Yeah, he's great.
- Sweet.
So what's up?
Look, I wanted to ask you about an employee
- Curtis Tucker.
- What about him?
- What do you know about him?
Not much.
Quiet, keeps to himself.
Why?
I think he's got a hard-on for my baby bro.
Who doesn't?
No, not that kind of a hard-on.
More of a stalkerish nature.
Yeah, it wouldn't shock me.
Kid is creepy.
- Have you seen him?
- Not since yesterday, no.
But I think he switched shifts so he should be around at, like, 4:00.
Great.
Maybe I'll be there too.
You're not going to cause trouble now, are you, Drama?
- Would you like it if I did?
- You know it.
Although I am still recovering from you dislocating my pinkie at that SM seminar.
Maybe I'll make it up to you.
Ciao.
Hey.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Everything fit OK?
- Yeah.
- I gotta run to the set.
- OK.
- I thought you were taking a nap?
- Later!
- Later.
Tom, I don't know if it's a real offer or not.
- I'm just telling you what was said.
- Lloyd!
- I gotta go.
- Lloyd!
Coming, Mr Gold.
- Yes, sir.
- I spilled water all over my keyboard.
- Why?
- Because you were so busy,
- you accidentally knocked it over.
- No, because the only water that is available is in these stupid little cups.
No bottles.
Where are the bottles?
In the landfill.
You said you wanted to be more green.
That's because Leo was in earshot.
- I'll switch your keyboard right away.
- Good.
Wait till I'm out of the office before you get on your knees.
- Ari...
Mr Gold.
- What?
- You know it's been 50 days.
- 50 days.
You said 100 days of hell and then I'd be an agent.
It's been 50.
So I just want to make sure we're still on track.
- Still on track?
- That nothing's changed?
Are you seriously questioning me?
I'm just asking.
Because today I was offered a job.
- You were offered a job?
- A real job, Ari.
To be an agent, which of course is what I've always wanted, but to be an agent for you!
So I just want to make sure that I'm still going to be in 50 days.
- I just added 10 days.
- Ari, no!
- 10 more!
Want to keep questioning me?
- I just...
Or keep telling me about your other job opportunities?
- Ari!
- It's "Mr. Gold" for 70.
Now 80!
Or you can go ahead and represent dancing Chihuahuas or whatever your offer is.
Go ahead, keep questioning me.
I dare you.
- Please.
- 90 days.
This is not The Breakfast Club, Mr Gold, this is my life.
100 days.
You want 10 more?
- You just got 'em.
- For what?
For what you were thinking.
Now I've got chores for you when you're done cleaning up my keyboard.
Get my car, have it washed.
Go get my dry-cleaning, bring it to my house, clean up all the dogshit and my neighbour's.
Don't you ever question my word again!
- Go.
- Yes, sir.
- What do you mean they lost him?
- Just what I said.
Now they're following me around as if I'm the problem.
- Am I supposed to go home?
- No, no, no.
I got the situation under control.
I'm sure you do.
Did I look weird today?
Like I memorise you every morning.
What do you need, Drama?
I need you to call the house, tell Cohn that you need a man with you.
- Why?
- So I can give this perv a good old-fashioned New York warning.
- I...
- Hey.
- I'm Brooke.
- Hi.
- Turtle, are you listening to me?
- Yes.
- I have a homework question.
- Are you in my class?
No.
I'll ask you later.
- Ask me what?
- Stop socialising and call Aaron.
Do you really want to sit around and wait for this guy to come to us?
- What the hell?
- Is that what we are - passive pussies?
My break's over.
I've got to get to class.
- Come on, Turtle!
- Fine!
Later.
I'm coming as soon as your car is washed.
- You haven't done that yet?
- It's only been 30 minutes,
I'm moving as fast as I can.
If you had dropped the weight like I told you to, you'd be a little more aerodynamic.
I wanted to do it last so it was as fresh as possible.
Jesus Christ, 10 more days.
- Ari, why?
- Because you're weak, Lloyd.
- I am not.
- Don't cry.
I am not crying!
Because I will add a whole new lifetime if you start crying.
- I am not crying, Ari.
- It's "Mr Gold."
I'm not fucking crying, Mr Gold!
Oh my God!
- What happened?
- I've been hit.
- What?
- You've been hit, rear-ended.
- Oh God.
- Jesus Christ!
- Are you kidding me?
!
- Ari, it wasn't my fault.
Everything is your fault.
It's your fault because you accused me of crying when I wasn't and accused me of being weak when I'm not!
You're blaming me for you crashing my car?
I'm blaming you for ruining my life!
Get your ass back here before you say something you're going to regret.
I regret ever having met you, Ari Gold.
Your car is on Wilshire and Crescent waiting for you.
- You're abandoning it?
!
- Yes, and I'm abandoning you!
Lloyd?
Lloyd!
Lloyd!
Johnny Drama.
Hey, Sadie, good to see you.
You too.
What's up with your face?
- It's makeup.
- Sexy.
- Is he here yet?
- No, not yet.
- Why don't you browse?
- Cool.
I'll be in bondage.
I'll sneak away when I can.
- You want to double tonight?
- With who?
You and the clothing girl?
- She's cool.
- You've known her minutes.
- How do you know?
- Good instincts.
I think I gotta go alone.
I've got some work to do with Ashley.
Speaking of which.
Are your ears burning?
We were talking about you.
- Where are you?
- I'm at Vince's.
I thought you were gonna be at the office all day.
I thought so too, but something came up.
Where are you?
At your office.
- I wanted to surprise you.
- I'm sorry.
I met your assistant.
Vince, we've got a problem.
There's a problem here.
Can I call you back?
Yeah, sure!
- Bye.
- What happened?
Your crazy brother is inside the Pleasure Chest.
We've got sight of our main suspect.
He's pulling up there right now.
- I'm gonna call him.
- No, no, I'll call him.
Hey, Curtis.
How you doing?
All right.
What's going on?
Hello, Curtis, how are you?
I'm OK.
Do I know you?
- I don't know, do you?
- You look kind of familiar.
Walk with me, Curtis.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- All right, thanks.
I'll email you.
- All right.
Hey!
Sorry.
What's up?
I don't really have a homework question.
No, you just like to laugh at me?
I haven't been laughing at you.
They have.
I think you're really cute.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- So why are they laughing at me?
- They know things.
- Like what?
- Like that you live in quite the house.
- How do they know that?
- 1250 North Crossroads Drive.
What's that about?
- I have a roommate.
- And a dog.
And you prefer boxers to briefs.
What the hell is going on?
They're all wearing your underwear.
See?
Our rush chairman told us we had to steal
Jamie-Lynn Sigler's boyfriend's underwear.
Sorry.
- You broke in and stole my underwear?
- No, not me.
I only wear thongs.
- Vincent Chase!
- Vincent Chase.
- What about him?
- Admit it, you were at his house.
- I wasn't.
- You were.
And I found your licence to prove it.
I lost this licence years ago.
Where did you find it?
- In the couch!
- Where did you get the couch?
- What does it matter?
- HD Buttercup?
Yeah, maybe.
- How did you know?
- I used to sell furniture there.
- Maybe it fell in.
- Bullshit!
How long have you been stalking Vince?
Johnny, Vince is on the phone.
He says to tell you it was all a sorority prank on Turtle.
Here's my current licence.
It's not lost, see?
Who would have thought that a girl would want to get my underwear before Vince's?
Who would have thought anyone would want to get anywhere near your underwear?
Don't be bitter because I have more fans than you.
- You gonna tell Jamie?
- No.
Drama stopped the real stalker in my story.
- Good move.
- If he was the real one,
I would have stopped him.
Trust me.
Guys, what do you want to do tonight?
- Celebrate our freedom.
- E, you got Ashley?
- I called her, haven't heard back yet.
- I gotta work.
I don't think that face would do great in clubs anyway.
I think that makeup's bringing on some adult acne.
Right?
- I'm gonna kill you, Drama.
- You and what sorority sister?
So, listen, Vinnie, I'm glad it all worked out.
- So are you gonna join us out tonight?
- No can do.
Got a mess I'm dealing with here at the office.
- Everything OK?
- It will be.
- OK, talk later.
- All right, later.
Hi, Mr Gold.
I'm Craig.
HR sent me down to fill in for Lloyd.
Great.
I really look forward to helping you out.
- Do you know when he'll be back?
- You want the truth?
- Sure.
- He won't.
I killed him.
I shot him and I buried him underneath my desk.
- Any more questions?
- No.
Good.
Now get out of here before I kill you too.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
But I do admit to a failure of judgment in my dealings with these women.
I've never abused my office for sexual favors.
Give us time to heal and rebuild their trust.
Mom, breakfast!
Oh, hey, congratulations.
That's great.
Your husband, looks like he could get out of prison.
- Looks like it.
- Early Show had a story on it.
- Stuff on you too.
Catch it?
- No, I missed it.
Yeah, I caught it online.
I could send you the link.
- That's okay.
- No, no, no.
It's easy.
Litigation wants me on this new class action.
That's where I'm headed.
What about you?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, in here I guess.
When did you say this was?
May 15th.
Four months ago.
Do you have anything with the date?
A parking receipt.
Had you ever met Mr. McKeon before?
No.
I'd seen his family on the news.
I heard about their hotels and stuff, but that's about it.
Well, the problem here, Christy, is that any civil suit could be seen as opportunistic.
Because of their money?
- Yes.
I'm sorry, but I didn't choose my rapist.
This kid doesn't know what she's in for, taking on McKeon.
- Alicia, if you don't mind, we need to...
- It's all right.
Stay.
I don't know about this.
It's a criminal case, not a civil one.
Except the new state's attorney rejected the charges.
Yeah, because it's got Duke lacrosse written all over it.
- Oh, come on.
- Put your politics aside, Diane.
You're Glenn Childs, you get this dropped in your lap, a stripper at a bachelor party accusing the son of the most powerful family in Chicago of rape, and you don't think it's Duke lacrosse 2?
He's worried about the McKeon family money.
He's worried about their campaign contributions.
Well, I'm worried that we're overextended.
How many Sheffrin-Marks depos do we have left?
Do you believe her?
I believe a lot of things I can't prove.
All right, here's what I think.
I know the McKeon family lawyer.
- Ericcson?
- Right, William Ericcson.
That's just what we need, two Wills.
McKeon's are gonna keep this out of the press.
So my guess is, they throw her some cash.
Maybe 50 grand or so to keep her quiet.
Yeah.
William Ericcson's office.
- Mr. Ericcson, please.
May I tell him who's calling?
Tell him it's the other Will.
I want you to be at this lunch.
Don't say anything, just listen and look serious.
I can do that.
- How you holding up here?
- I'm holding up.
Oh, yeah.
How do you know her?
- Who?
- Christy?
I don't.
Then why did she ask for you to be on the case?
I don't know.
Ericcson here.
Will.
Will.
I think you know why I'm calling.
Two months ago Peter Florrick was sentenced to ten years for bribery and corruption.
Today was the first step toward his release.
He was known in Chicago simply as The Hammer.
He jailed cop killers, CEO's, corrupt politicians, until The Hammer got hammered.
An hour ago I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
Within weeks,
Chicago's incorruptible state's attorney found himself with all the trappings of a modern American scandal.
A rival with an eye on his job, an embarrassed wife, a blushing call girl, and an R-rated sex tape.
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God, please, you are...
- Hey, ever heard the whole thing?
- No.
You're the only one who hasn't.
Everything I have on McKeon.
What?
I beat you three sets to two.
Oh, come on.
You don't even believe that.
This is driving me crazy.
How do I know you?
- Me?
- Minor, Parsons Layton?
Alicia's actually our newest junior associate, one month in.
Will Ericcson, Alicia Florrick.
It's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- You too.
- I'm rooting for your husband.
I know he has a lot of enemies in this town, but I always root for the underdog.
No, no, just ignore him.
The only reason someone's forced out of public office in America these days is sex.
So let's talk about Lloyd McKeon.
So sad, really.
I remember when you had a respectable firm, Will.
One that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these.
And what charges might those be, Will?
I haven't said anything yet.
Do you think you're the first firm she's shopping this lawsuit to?
There's nothing there.
Even the new state's attorney thinks there's nothing there.
And yet I got you to a settlement lunch on a half-hour's notice.
Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage?
- You wanna know what I would say?
- I would.
I would say you're trying to change the subject from rape.
Well, I would agree that as offensive and misguided as these charges are, the optics aren't exactly in our favor, so we're willing to make an offer.
It's non-negotiable.
You have till end of business day.
McKeon did it.
Under 100 thou, I would have said no.
- Over 100 thou...
- How about well over?
If you don't mind my asking, Miss Barbosa, why did you request me?
I saw you on TV.
I thought you'd understand what it's like to be misunderstood.
Ladies.
Sorry about that.
McKeon's lawyers made a financial offer that Diane and I actually agree on.
A first.
It's a cash settlement, $450,000.
You're kidding?
We don't have to go to court?
He just offered that?
You'll have to sign a confidentiality agreement.
Both parties free each other of liability and agree not to speak to anyone.
- What?
It's standard in civil agreements.
I want everybody to know he settled.
Can't we tell the police?
Not if we sign a confidentiality agreement.
McKeon could withdraw the award and sue you for defamation.
- What do you think?
- I think under the circum...
I think you're looking for justice, Christy.
And sometimes justice comes in a form we don't expect.
If you take this money, the settlement will be known to the two people that matter most:
You and him.
I'm sorry, no.
He'll know how much it costs to rape somebody and get away with it.
That's all.
This is about him admitting that he did this to me.
She's right.
Okay, Ericcson, how flexible are you on confidentiality?
Exclude new criminal discovery.
Oh, come on.
This isn't...
You wanna go to court, is that it?
Take it as far as pre-trial?
He doesn't wanna go to trial.
Look, Ericcson, you wanna make McKeon The Bachelor Party Rapist, be my...
That's how you wanna play it?
We turned down a half a million bucks.
Feels good, doesn't it?
Looks like we got a case.
You have to size these things up pretty quickly.
Twelve clients.
Stockbroker types.
No one out of control.
It was easy.
They paid $400 for a 90-minute two-girl fantasy strip.
Two-girl?
Who's the other girl?
Maura.
I don't remember her last name.
That was the only time she...
Sorry.
She insists on being here during all of this.
It's a nightmare.
And McKeon, how'd you meet him?
The groom?
He offered me another $100 for a private lap dance.
When I got in the bedroom, he locked the door.
Then he grabbed me.
I tried to get the Mace from my bag.
I tried to shout.
Did you tell anyone afterwards?
Maura, and our driver, Grant.
He suggested she drive me to the hospital for the rape exam.
And the service, Worldwide Elite, how long did you work for them?
- Two years.
- And what else did you do there?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what else did you do there?
For a year, I was an escort.
Didn't you think that might be important to tell us?
I haven't gone on a call in a year.
I was in an abusive relationship.
I needed the money to move out.
When I moved, I stopped working.
But still stripped.
So, what's your point?
A call girl can't get raped?
Yeah, that's my point, thanks.
Look, she lied to us.
Why believe her now?
She walked away from half a million dollars.
And when did she ever lie to us?
The more you bond, the less helpful you are.
Your stripper was hooking.
Why is she my stripper when she does something bad?
Okay, so the point is to prepare for trial so we don't actually have to go to trial.
- Cary, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice suit.
I got a job for you.
I need you take Alicia's Sheffrin-Marks depos for the week.
- All right, I'm on it.
This is settlement poker.
No one wants to go to trial, but the person who plays the better hand makes the better deal.
So get me some good cards.
And so your first thought is to come to the state's attorney's office.
I just need one thing.
- And why would I help you with that?
- Because you like me.
- That still works with people?
Mm.
Like a charm.
You never should have quit.
I didn't quit.
I was fired.
Come on, you ran a solid rape investigation.
You should be dying to slip us the witness interviews.
Leah, could you come outside for a second?
And you're telling me your husband had nothing to do with this?
Mr. Childs, my law firm is bringing on a civil action, that's all.
To embarrass my office, make it look like I don't care about a rape victim.
A happy coincidence?
I understand the need to blame someone for your husband's downfall.
But I didn't release that sex tape to hurt you or your family.
I have kids too.
You should know, I was holding back.
I had more to release about your husband.
A lot more.
Disturbing things.
But out of compassion, I held back.
Mr. Childs, if you have something to show me, just do it, okay?
Because the one thing I don't have time for these days is empty threats.
You want something on your stripper?
Get a subpoena.
I like Christy.
She was one of my best dancers, but I have nothing else to add.
I'm sorry.
We just need contact information, Ms. Avraski, for the driver and stripper.
Dancer.
Look, I would love...
Because we'd really hate to subpoena your books and client records.
- You're East Indian?
- Yeah.
Hm.
It's very popular these days.
Contact information?
Follow me.
Why A, B, C?
Fifteen hundred an hour, 2,100, and 3,100.
What makes someone more expensive?
Is this about the rape?
No.
Regular clients, and special requests.
Requests?
No condoms.
Or being dominated.
Or role-playing.
Whatever they can't get at home.
People would really pay $3,000 an hour?
The day rate is $31,000, dawn to dawn.
So about this rape, can you get me contact information on this dancer?
Maura?
She quit right afterwards.
Left a fake number, fake address, fake social.
Happens all the time.
What about the driver?
Could you help me find him?
So, Mom, where are you anyway?
Look, I have to work late tonight.
Can you ask Grandma if she can stay until 10?
Sure.
Grandma, can you stay until 10?
Mom's working late.
No need to shout, dear.
If she has to, she has to.
Grandma can stay.
I was talking to Grandma, and she said she visited Dad this weekend, and he was saying how much he missed us.
Grandma said that?
I was thinking maybe we should be going there.
You know, visiting him.
Your dad didn't want you to see him like that, in prison.
He was...
He didn't want you to worry.
But let me ask him.
Maybe he's changed his mind, okay?
Right.
We'll talk about it when I get home tonight, okay?
All right, see you tonight.
I trust you're doing your homework.
Five minutes.
- You can corroborate Christy's story?
- Which was?
That she told you about the rape right after it happened.
Look, I like Christy, she's a good tipper, but when she drinks she doesn't know what she's talking about.
But you do.
Christy gave a lap dance, he paid, we went home.
Nobody said anything about rape.
I don't blame Christy for trying to get money out of McKeon.
But, hey, she's lying.
Is that Dad?
I don't know.
But you're thinking it too.
I'm gonna need your help in a minute.
Dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.
Should we tell Mom?
They sent them to Mom to hurt her, so I say no.
So?
I don't know, do they wanna see me?
Oh, Zach does, but Grace doesn't?
She's hurt.
She thought you were everything.
So two months in, you seem well.
I am.
There's some good guys here.
There's probably less backstabbing than the State Attorney's Office.
You look good.
It's like it agrees with you.
So here's the thing about Childs.
Everything he does is a political calculation...
Peter, no.
I don't wanna be used.
Alicia, I know you don't believe me, but Childs set me up, and if what I give you can help a rape victim, what's wrong with that?
How do you know she's a rape victim, Peter?
I didn't tell your mom.
Daniel told me.
Your appellate lawyer?
He's the one who referred Christy to you.
What's wrong?
I'm hard-pressed to think what's not wrong.
So he what?
Well, I mentioned to Daniel that you were at Stern, Lockhart, and that if he didn't have time for Christy's case that maybe you would.
I thought you'd want the work.
You thought it was a good idea to send me a hooker to represent?
No, I thought it was a good idea to send you a rape victim.
Oh, my God.
You had sex with her.
What?
You're using her first name, Peter.
You're saying Christy.
She's one of your whores.
Alicia, would you stop it?
When are you gonna stop thinking that I slept with everyone?
When are you gonna forgive me, for God's sake?
How much did you spend on Amber?
You had sex with her, what?
Ten times, 20 times?
You don't wanna know the details of what I did.
If you want me for forgive you, I need to know what I'm forgiving you for.
So at $3,000 a pop, that's what?
Sixty thousand dollars?
Did you pay her not to use a condom?
Was that extra?
Your trip to Houston.
Did you take her with you?
- You know I didn't.
- I don't know what I know.
Attention:
Today's visitation is now over.
Grace's 12th birthday party, you said...
You said you had to leave early.
Where did you go, Peter?
You answer those questions, and then we'll talk about forgiveness.
This is a pre-trial hearing, so don't worry about the driver yet.
We just need to win a few motions.
- Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
It all comes down to the rape kit.
Still no luck finding the other stripper.
All we have is a first name, Maura.
And a general description.
We need to box McKeon in.
There's only one of two ways his semen ends up that rape kit.
Consensual sex or rape.
We get him to swear there was no consensual sex.
Why would he do that?
Because he has a wife.
There you are.
How you doing?
You nervous?
No, but maybe I should be?
This is just a pre-trial hearing.
The state's attorney is trying to squash our subpoena.
We get the ground rules straight in case this thing goes to trial.
Kalinda, get in the state's attorney's office, and wait for the subpoena.
I'll do that.
What?
You don't have to.
I know.
I'll be back.
- You all right?
- Yeah, sure.
I'm fine.
Oh, my God.
This is too good.
We've got Judge Abernathy.
He's our newest judge.
He's so liberal, he makes Michael Moore look like Rush Limbaugh.
Justice may be blind, but judges sure aren't.
God, Ericcson must be pulling his hair out.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Oh, please don't stand, everybody.
Sit back down, please.
We've got a big room here, don't we?
Your Honor, given the stature of my client, Mr. McKeon, and given the fact that this pre-trial hearing has already garnered the attention of our friends in the press, we ask the court to seal the pre-trial filings and avoid a show trial.
Oh, Mr. Ericcson, I don't think we need to do all that, do we?
First Amendment issues and all?
I deny the petition with regret.
- Mr. Gardner?
- Yes, Your Honor.
We have a lot of testimony focusing on whether there was a consensual act between Mr. McKeon and my client.
But if Mr. McKeon is willing to stipulate there was a consensual sexual act, we would forego this testimony.
That's a good point.
Mr. Ericcson, how do you respond?
We would stipulate there was no sex of any kind, forced or consensual, Your Honor.
The plaintiff requests an expedited trial date, Your Honor.
A DNA sample from Mr. McKeon, DNA results from the rape kit, and the reports from the state's attorney.
They have been reluctant to furnish them.
Thank you, counselor, I will grant all four motions.
Mr. Ericcson?
I interpret from Mr. Ericcson's gesture that he acquiesces.
Well, I'll see you all back here...
Let's see, my docket is clear.
Five days?
How's that for expedited?
As a side note,
I would like to ask for a moment of silence for the recent mass killings in Darfur.
Okay, thank you.
Court adjourned.
That was a great start, huh?
You're having trouble with the driver?
You've boxed in on the rape kit.
You should settle on our terms.
Yeah, right.
See you in trial.
May 15th, four months ago.
This one seemed cool, this one...
- Hey, so you know Will?
- Twelve clients.
Stockbroker types.
You two went to school together?
That's what they were saying the other night at drinks.
Yeah.
- So that's why.
Cary, if you don't mind, I've had only a week with this.
You've got an expedited trial date to force the other side to settle and now you guys are the ones suffering.
- What are you looking for?
- TZK Industries.
I've seen it somewhere before.
What is TZK Industries?
TZK Industries.
It's a furniture supply company, supplying elegant furniture.
Why, what do you need?
Something to undercut Christy's driver.
Okay.
Oh.
It can't be that easy, can it?
What?
Now, I find this odd, Mr. Grant.
You were there, and you say there was no rape.
So either you're lying or my client's lying.
All I know is what I saw, sir.
Request permission to approach the witness.
Yes, please.
Approach.
Mr. Grant, this is a copy of your wife's W-2.
Could you read the name of your wife's employer, please?
"TZK Industries."
And TZK Industries is a company owned by the McKeon family to supply furniture to...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
Well, I think it's all right for it to be asked, Mr. Ericcson.
L...
Actually, sustained.
You sustained the objection?
I did.
Mr. Ericcson has a point.
Isn't it an amazing coincidence, Mr. Grant, that after a year of unemployment your wife got a job in June, from the McKeon family, a month after the bachelor party incident?
- No.
- And why is that, Mr. Grant?
Because my wife and I are divorced.
My wife and I have been separated for a year now.
So her getting this job has nothing to do with me.
But, sir, wouldn't you benefit, even if only in the form of lowered spousal support?
I guess, but I'm not Warren Buffet.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm sorry, I didn't see it.
Don't ever let your first chair get undercut like that again.
Good news?
I just got the rape kit results.
The state's attorney wasn't stonewalling.
They sent it out to a commercial lab and just got it back.
And?
It's not McKeon's DNA.
The rape kit came back.
It's not his sperm.
It's not McKeon's DNA.
Grant says you're lying.
- McKeon says you're lying.
- I'm not lying.
L...
- It's really not his sperm?
- Christy, we need to get the full...
- Who else did you have sex with?
- No one, I swear.
Well, you obviously had sex with someone because it isn't his sperm.
So was it a boyfriend?
Or another client?
You need to find Maura.
We can't find Maura.
You really don't remember anything that could help us find her?
We didn't talk.
She was on her cell phone the whole night until her battery ran out.
I'm sorry,
I need to get to class.
Not that I mind it, but since when did you become me?
- You didn't believe her, I did.
- Maybe she is telling the truth.
Christy said the light was flicked out, so maybe McKeon was with a friend.
So let's see if the cops tested the other party-goers.
Worth a try.
It's not just that.
What's up with your bud, Abernathy?
He's going out of his way to kill us.
Liberal judge gets on the bench, doesn't want to rule from his bias, so he bends the other way.
You said you had some pull.
He wanted to be on your Glass Ceiling committee.
Emily's List.
Are you suggesting I influence a sitting judge in some untoward fashion?
No, just in a toward one.
Come on, come to the court, let him see your sad little liberal face and contemplate a life without his friends.
Will, I'm so sorry.
Don't be, we're a team.
No apologies.
Hey.
Now what are you doing?
- Close the door.
- Come on, Zach, just let it go.
Would you shut up and look at this?
You see that?
It's called a specular highlight.
It's like a light in the eye, reflected in the eye.
See where it is?
It's to the left.
Now, look at this.
The lady's eye.
See?
The dot is to the right.
- Okay.
- They're not in the same picture.
Dad's face was Photoshopped into it.
Hello?
Zach, Grace, I'm home.
Jackie, I have a request to make.
Certainly, dear.
If you want the kids to visit Peter in prison, you talk to me.
- You don't talk to Zach.
- When did I talk to Zach?
You told him Peter was lonely.
Because he is.
Just don't go around me by talking to my kids.
Hey, Mom.
Hey.
- How was work?
- It was crappy.
I thought I'd make breakfast.
For dinner?
My goodness.
Like when you were little.
You don't have to like it.
It's for me.
So I wanna show you some pictures of where Dad's staying.
What?
I wanna make sure you know what's involved with visiting Dad in prison, okay?
I'll get that.
So, Zach, can you show me how to get to Google images on your computer?
Yeah, sure.
What is that?
Nothing.
Homework.
Mom?
Someone's here.
Hi.
Still no Maura?
DNA is definitely not from McKeon's semen.
I was going to the crime lab to see if they ever collected DNA from the other party-goers when...
You can watch a little TV.
I'll be right in.
Wanna do this later?
No, no, no.
I think I just caught my son checking out porn.
Anyway, I asked a cop friend to run the rape kit results through CODIS.
And they got a hit.
Who?
The best man?
Manny Lyons.
A rapist serving 20-to-life in an Ohio supermax.
- I don't understand.
- You're in good company.
And he's a convicted rapist.
So Christy was raped.
Apparently.
I don't get it.
Was he...?
Was he at the party?
As far as I can tell, he was in the holding cell in Columbus at the time.
This makes no sense.
We know.
This pile is everything on the Manny Lyons rape.
This pile, everything on ours.
And we can't find one thing in common.
No connection with McKeon?
No.
We checked it.
"Manny Lyons broke into an upper Arlington apartment, held a knife to the neck of a 40-year divorcee, raped her, and stole her car.
He was stopped running a traffic light ten miles away.
The divorcee identified him in a six-pack photo lineup."
What?
They do have one thing in common.
And you're the lab supervisor who worked on analysis 5795.
The rape kit in this case, professor?
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
And these are your initials, G.G., right at the bottom of the report?
Yes, those are mine.
Oh, excuse me.
This isn't 5795, this is 5794.
The Manny Lyons case.
My mistake.
Oh, I see that you ran the analysis on both cases.
Given the sequential numbering,
I imagine that you worked on one right after the other.
It appears so.
In both cases, the DNA matched the same culprit, Manny Lyons, is that correct?
- It is.
- So let...
Let me follow the logic here.
Manny Lyons, who never set foot in Chicago...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
I will sustain that.
Isn't it true, Dr. Girtzman, the only connection between Manny Lyons and Christy Barbosa is that you worked on both cases?
Objection.
Argumentative.
Mrs. Florrick, this is not a debating society.
Sustained.
Dr. Girtzman, would you say that the standard of a commercial lab is relaxed?
No.
And, Your Honor, may I answer her earlier question, personal privilege?
Oh, yeah, if you'd like.
We handle an immense backlog of untested rape kits from crime labs all across the country.
We do so with speed and professionalism.
And yet isn't it true, sir, that your lab almost lost its accreditation in 2005...
No, that was never proved.
- When you cross-contaminated two DNA samples?
This is an old slander.
That you failed to sterilize scissors, that carried the DNA from one sample to the next?
- I don't have to answer this.
- Actually, you do, sir.
Your Honor, given this testimony, we move that the rape kit be re-examined at a second genetic lab.
I think that is an understandable request, Mr. Ericcson.
Your Honor, we would stipulate that Mrs. Florrick has proven her case.
Dr. Girtzman cross-contaminated the samples.
But we argue that is the very reason they cannot be tested again.
You gotta be kidding me.
The very fact that it is agreed that the sample is now contaminated, means it can't possibly be tested with any authority.
Mr. Gardner, you argued that the rape kit was contaminated.
You can't now argue it's probative.
The plaintiff's motion for retesting is denied.
- Your Honor...
- Motion is denied.
We gotta find that other stripper.
So basically, this is a Hail Mary pass?
Look at you with the sports metaphors.
Yeah, I don't see many other options here.
Good evening, do you have a reservation?
Actually, we have a strange request.
We need to get a printout of a phone bill from four months ago.
- The name?
- McKeon.
First name?
Lloyd.
Would you like that e-mailed or a hard copy?
Hard copy.
If I could just see some ID, Mr. McKeon.
Well, actually, can I ask you a question, Rosemary?
There was a bachelor party here in May that resulted in a rape.
- Were you here then?
- I was.
Well, the only person we believe who can corroborate the rape victim's story was using a cell phone that night, and we're thinking she used the bathroom phone when her battery ran out.
We were hoping to glance at the bill just to see if there was a number she dialed.
I'll have to speak to our manager.
Nice thought.
If all else fails, try honesty.
I got 20 bucks on deception.
- Will?
- Oh, hey.
What are you doing north of the loop?
Oh, you know, seeing how the other half lives.
Alicia, this is Marlana.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
Ask for a view of the lake.
It's beautiful at night.
She thinks we're getting a room.
Yep.
Now they all think we're getting a room.
- You worried?
- You?
We could do worse.
I'm having trouble getting my manager.
If you could just wait another minute.
I owe you 20.
Okay, Christy and Maura arrived at 10:15.
Right there, 11:20.
Out of state area code.
Hello, you don't know me...
Were you the other dancer there that night, Maura?
I was, yes.
And your driver, Mr. Grant, what did he tell you after you took Christy to the hospital?
He told us that the McKeons were very rich and we should all keep our mouth shut.
And that's why you went home to Michigan?
Yes.
- I'm sorry, I was scared.
- It's okay.
And to reiterate,
Christy told you about the rape immediately afterward?
Yes, in fact, he followed her out into the parking lot.
And he said, "Don't tell anyone.
Just take the money and shut up."
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Alicia, for, you know...
Christy, I'm just curious.
Where did you meet my husband?
Your husband?
I've never met your husband.
My mistake.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Good afternoon.
I have given this case quite a bit of thought, as you can imagine.
You have both argued your case well, but I find myself judging in favor of the defendant.
Without a DNA match to the rape kit, we have a classic "he said, she said."
And as much as my personal sympathies lie with the plaintiff, the evidence does not warrant a favorable decision.
Judgment in favor of the defense.
Are you okay?
No.
I'm sorry.
I believe you.
There he is.
Lloyd, tell us what happened.
Do you feel you can get your good name back?
This is all I wanna say.
I have been falsely accused by a woman who wanted nothing more than a quick pay day.
But every year, there are thousands of women who are abused, and I don't think we should let this false accusation...
Mr. McKeon, you are under arrest for the rape of Christy Barbosa.
- What?
- Cuff him.
- What?
- What's going on?
McKEON:
Is this a joke?
It must be hard to lose, Mrs. Florrick.
Not if it forces you to prosecute.
I'm coming out of this with a criminal case I'll win.
You're coming out with a loss.
Nice job.
Lloyd McKeon was arrested today for rape literally seconds after he was cleared in a civil case for the identical crime.
State's Attorney Glenn Childs took credit for finding an untainted sample of DNA that will guarantee McKeon's conviction in a criminal trial.
Childs denied that McKeon's arrest...
This is yours?
Yeah.
Is he going to jail?
I think so.
Well, then, that's good.
Thanks.
Good night.
- Good night.
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God.
Please.
You are amazing.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do to you?
Just don't stop.
What'll you give me?
What'll you give me not to stop?
Everything.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of cook county.
Are you still involved with prostitutes, sir?
Thanks for playing the breadwinner for a while.
It's not gonna last forever.
I just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity.
Glad you could come aboard.
Not only are you coming back to the workplace fairly late, but you have some very prominent baggage.
But, hey, if she can do it, so can you.
Kalinda Sharma.
Oh, the investigator.
You're Peter Florrick's wife.
That's right.
Last time I was in court was 13 years ago.
Wow, I was 12.
State's attorney's here.
I'm glenn Childs.
Peter blames me for his downfall.
Don't make yourself collateral damage here.
The day you leaked that sex tape to the press and forced me to shield my children, that was the day I became collateral damage.
You've obviously never made a woman angry before.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of cook county.
but I do admit to a failure of judgment in my dealings with these women.
I've never abused my office for sexual favors.
Give us time to heal and rebuild their trust... trust...
Mom, breakfast.
Oh, hey, congratulations.
That's great.
Your husband's appeal... it looks like he could get out of prison any month now, huh?
Looks like it.
Early Show had a story on it.
Some good stuff on you, too.
Did you catch it?
No, missed it.
Yeah, I caught it online.
I can send you the link.
That's okay.
No, no, no, it's easy.
So litigation wants me on this new class action.
That's where I'm headed.
What about you?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, in here, I guess.
When did you say this was?
May 15, four months ago.
Do you have anything with the date?
A parking receipt.
Had you ever met Mr. McKeon before?
No.
I'd seen his family on the news.
I heard about their hotels and stuff, but that's about it.
Well, the problem here, Christy, is that any civil suit could be seen as... opportunistic.
Because of their money?
Yes.
I'm sorry, but I didn't choose my rapist.
This kid doesn't know what she's in for.
Taking on the McKeon family...
Alicia, if you don't mind, we just need to...
No, it's all right, stay.
I don't know about this.
It's a criminal case, not a civil one.
Except the new state's attorney rejected the charges.
Yeah, because it's got
Duke Lacrosse written all over it.
Oh, come on.
What come on?
Put your politics aside, Diane.
You're Glenn Childs, you get this dropped in your lap... a stripper at a bachelor party accusing the son of the most powerful family in Chicago of rape... and you don't think it's Duke Lacrosse II?
He's worried about the McKeon family money.
He's worried about their campaign contributions.
Well, I'm worried that we're overextended.
How many sheffrin-marks depos o we have left?
210.
210.
We need to keep our eye on the ball.
And Christy is just gonna look like she's trying to make some quick cash from the McKeon family.
Do you believe her?
I believe a lot of things
I can't prove.
All right, here's what I think.
I know the McKeon family lawyer.
Ericcson?
Right,
William Ericcson.
That's just what we need... two Wills.
The McKeons are gonna want to keep this out of the press, even if he didn't do it.
So my guess is they throw her some cash, maybe 50 grand or so to keep her quiet.
Hmm, yeah.
Mr. Ericcson, please.
Tell him it's the other Will.
I want you to be at this lunch.
Don't say anything.
Just listen and look serious.
I can do that.
How you holding up here?
I'm holding up.
Oh, yeah, how do you know her?
Who?
Christy.
I don't.
Then why did she ask for you to be on the case?
I don't know.
Ericcson here.
Will.
Will.
I think you know why I'm calling.
Two months ago, Peter Florrick was sentenced to ten years for bribery and corruption.
Today was the first step toward his release.
He was known in Chicago simply as "the Hammer."
He jailed cop-killers, ceos, corrupt politicians, until "the hammer" got hammered.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
Within weeks, Chicago's incorruptible state's attorney found himself with all the trappings of a modern American scandal:
A rival with an eye on his job, an embarrassed wife, a blushing call girl and an R-rated sex tape.
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God, please.
You are ama...
Hey, ever heard the whole thing?
No.
You're the only one who hasn't.
Everything I have on McKeon.
What?
!
I beat you three sets to two.
Oh, come on, you don't even believe that.
This is driving me crazy.
How do I know you?
Me?
Miner, Parsons Layton?
Alicia is actually our newest junior associate.
One month in.
Will Ericcson, Alicia Florrick.
Well, it is very nice to meet you,
Mrs. Florrick.
You, too.
I'm rooting for your husband.
I know he has a lot of enemies in this town, but I always root for the underdog.
Oh, just ignore him.
The only reason someone's forced out of public office in America these days is sex.
So let's talk about Lloyd McKeon.
It's so sad, really.
I remember when you had a respectable firm, Will.
One that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these.
And what charges might those be, Will?
I haven't said anything yet.
Do you think you're the first firm she's shopping this lawsuit to?
There's nothing there.
Even the state's attorney...
the new state's attorney... thinks there's nothing there.
And yet
I got you to a settlement lunch on a half hour's notice.
Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage?
You want to know what I would say?
I would.
I would say you're trying to change the subject from rape.
Well, I would agree that, as offensive and misguided as these charges are, the optics aren't exactly in our favor.
So we're willing to make an offer.
It's nonnegotiable.
You have till end of business day.
McKeon did it.
Under a hundred thou, I would've said no.
Over a hundred thou...
What about well over?
If you don't mind my asking, Ms. Barbosa, why did you request me?
I saw you on tv.
I thought you'd understand what it's like to be misunderstood.
Ladies.
Sorry about that.
McKeon's lawyers made a financial offer that Diane and I actually agree on.
A first.
It's a cash settlement.
$450,000.
You're kidding.
We don't have to go to court?
He just offered that?
You'll have to sign a standard confidentiality agreement.
Both parties free each other of liability and agree not to speak to anyone, including the press.
What?
It's standard in civil agreements.
I want everybody to know he settled.
Can't we tell the police?
Not if we sign a confidentiality agreement.
McKeon could withdraw the award and sue you for defamation.
What do you think?
I think under the cir...
I think you're looking for justice, Christy.
And sometimes justice comes in a form we don't expect.
If you take this money, the settlement will be known to the two people that matter most, you and him.
I'm sorry, no.
He'll know how much it costs to rape somebody and get away with it, that's all.
This is about him admitting that he did this to me.
She's right.
Okay, ericcson, how flexible are you on confidentiality?
Exclude new criminal discovery.
Oh, come on, this isn't...
You want to go to court, is that it?
Take it as far as pretrial?
He doesn't want to go to trial.
Look, Ericcson, you want to make McKeon the bachelor party rapist, be my...
That's how you want to play it?
We just turned down a half million bucks.
Feels good, doesn't it?
Looks like we got a case.
You have to size these things up pretty quickly.
12 clients, stockbroker types, no one out of control.
It was easy.
They paid $400 for a 90-minute, two-girl fantasy strip.
Two girl?
Who was the other girl?
Maura...
I...
I don't remember her last name.
That was the only time she worked.
Sorry.
She insists on being here during all this.
It's a nightmare.
And McKeon, how'd you meet him?
The groom?
Hmm.
He offered me another $100 for a private lap dance.
When I got in the bedroom, he locked the door.
Then he grabbed me.
I tried to get the mace from my bag, tried to shout.
Did you tell anyone afterwards?
Maura.
And our driver Grant.
He was the one who suggested she drive me to the hospital for the rape exam.
And the service, worldwide elite, how long did you work for them?
Two years.
And what else did you do there?
What do you mean?
I mean, what else did you do there?
For a year, I was an escort.
Didn't you think that might be important to tell us?
I haven't gone on a call in a year.
I was in an abusive relationship.
I needed the money to move out.
When I moved, I stopped working.
But still stripped.
So what's your point...
A call girl can't get raped?
Yeah, that's my point, thanks.
Look, she lied to us.
Why believe her now?
'Cause she walked away from half a million dollars.
And when did she ever lie to us?
You know, the more you bond with these clients, the less helpful you are.
Your stripper was hooking.
Why is she my stripper when she does something bad?
Okay, so the point is to prepare for trial so we don't actually have to go to trial.
Cary, right?
Yes, sir.
Nice suit.
I got a job for you.
I need you to take
Alicia's sheffrin-marks depos for the week.
All right, I'm on it.
This is settlement poker.
No one wants to go to trial, but the person who plays the better hand makes the better deal.
So get me some good cards.
So your first thought is to come to the state attorney's office?
I just need one thing.
And why do I help you, again?
Because you like me.
That still works with people?
Mm-hmm, like a charm.
You never should have quit this place.
I didn't quit.
I was fired.
Come on.
You ran a solid rape investigation.
You should be dying to slip us the witness interviews.
Leah,
Could you come outside for a second?
And you're telling me your husband had nothing to do with this?
Mr. Childs, my law firm is bringing on a civil action, that's all.
Designed to embarrass my office and make it look like I don't care about a rape victim.
A happy coincidence?
I understand the need to blame someone for your husband's downfall, but I didn't release that sex tape to hurt you or your family.
I have kids, too.
And you should know I was holding back.
I had more to release about your husband, a lot more.
Disturbing things, but out of compassion, I held back.
Mr. Childs, if you have something to show me, just do it, okay?
'Cause the one thing I don't have time for these days is empty threats.
You want something on your stripper?
Get a subpoena.
I liked Christy.
She was one of my best dancers.
But I have nothing else to add.
I'm sorry.
We just need contact information.
That's all, Ms. Avarski, for the driver and the stripper.
Dancer.
Look, I would love... because we'd really hate to subpoena your books and client records.
You're East Indian?
Yeah.
Hmm, it's very popular these days.
Contact information?
Follow me.
Why a-b-c?
$1,500 an hour,
$2,100 and, uh,
$3,100.
What makes someone more expensive?
Is this about the rape?
No.
Regular clients and special requests.
Requests?
No condoms or being dominated or role-playing.
Whatever they can't get at home.
People would really pay $3,000 an hour?
The day rate is
$31,000, dawn to dawn.
So about this rape, can you get me contact information on this dancer?
Maura?
She quit right afterwards.
Left a fake number, fake address, fake social.
Happens all the time.
What about the driver?
Could you help me find him?
Zach so, mom, where are you, anyway?
Look, I have to work late tonight.
Can you ask grandma if she can stay till 10:00?
Sure.
Grandma, can you stay till 10:00?
Mom's working late.
No need to shout, dear.
If she has to, she has to.
Grandma can stay.
So, mom, I was talking to grandma, and she said she visited dad this weekend, and he was saying how much he missed us.
Grandma said that?
I was thinking maybe we should be going there.
You know, visiting him?
Your dad didn't want you to see him like that in prison.
He was... he didn't want you to worry.
But let me ask him... maybe he's changed his mind, okay?
Right.
We'll talk about it when I get home tonight, okay?
All right, see you tonight.
I trust you're doing your homework.
Five minutes.
We understand you can corroborate Christy's story.
Which was?
That she told you about the rape right after it happened.
Look, I like Christy, she's a good tipper, but when she drinks, she doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
But you do?
Christy gave the guy a lap dance, he paid her, we went home.
Nobody said anything about any rape.
I don't blame Christy for trying to get extra money out of McKeon, but, hey, she's lying.
Is that dad?
I don't know.
But you're thinking it, too.
Gonna need your help in a minute.
Dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.
Do we tell mom?
They sent them to mom to hurt her.
So I say no.
So?
I don't know.
Do they want to see me?
Oh, Zach does, but Grace doesn't?
She's hurt.
She thought you were everything.
So two months in, you seem well.
I am.
Some good guys here.
There's probably less backstabbing than the state attorney's office.
You look good.
It's like it agrees with you.
So, here's the thing about Childs.
Everything he does is a political calculation.
Everything he says...
Peter, no.
I don't want to be used.
Alicia, I know you don't believe me, but Childs set me up.
And if what I give you can help a rape victim, what's wrong with that?
How do you know she's a rape victim, Peter?
I didn't tell your mom.
Daniel told me.
Your appellate lawyer?
He's the one who referred Christy to you.
What's wrong?
I'm hard-pressed to think what's not wrong.
So he what...?
Well...
I mentioned to Daniel that you were with Stern, Lockhart, and that if he didn't have time for Christy's case that maybe you would.
I thought you'd want the work.
You thought it was a good idea to send me a hooker to represent?
No, I thought it was a good idea to send you a rape victim.
Oh, my God.
You had sex with her.
What?
You're using her first name, Peter.
You're saying "Christy."
She's one of your whores.
Oh, Alicia, would you stop it?
When are you gonna stop thinking that I slept with everyone?
When are you gonna forgive me, for christ sakes?
How much did you spend on Amber?
You had sex with her, what, ten times, 20 times?
You don't want to know the details of what I did.
If you want me to forgive you,
I need to know what I'm forgiving you for.
So 3,000$ a pop, that's what 60,000$?
Did you pay her not to use a condom?
Was that extra?
Your trip to Houston, did you take her with you?
You know I didn't.
I don't know what I know.
Grace's 12th birthday party, you s...
You said you had to leave early.
Where did you go, Peter?
You answer those questions, and then we will talk about forgiveness.
This is a pretrial hearing, so don't worry about the driver yet.
We just need to win a few motions.
Sorry!
Don't worry about it.
It all comes down to the rape kit.
Still no luck finding the other stripper.
All we have is a first name, "Maura,"
and a general description.
We need to box McKeon in.
There's only one of two ways his semen ends up in that rape kit:
consensual sex or rape.
We get him to swear there was no consensual sex.
Why would he do that?
'Cause he has a wife.
There you are.
How you doing?
You nervous?
No, but maybe I should be.
This is just a pretrial hearing.
State's attorney's trying to squash our subpoena, so today we just get the ground rules straight, in case this thing goes to trial.
Kalinda, I need you to get upstairs, get in the state's attorney's office and wait for the subpoena.
I'll do that.
What?
You don't have to.
I know.
I'll be back.
You all right?
Yeah, sure, I'm fine.
Oh, my God, this is too good.
We got Judge Abernathy.
He's our newest judge.
He's so liberal, he makes Michael Moore look like Rush Limbaugh.
Justice may be blind, but judges sure aren't.
God, Ericcson must be pulling his hair out.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Oh, please, don't stand.
Everybody sit back down, please.
We've got the big room here, don't we?
Your Honor, given the stature of my client, Mr. McKeon, and given the fact that this pretrial hearing has already garnered the attention of our friends in the press,
We would ask the court to seal the pretrial filings and avoid a show trial.
Oh, Mr. Ericcson, I don't think we need to do all that.
Do we?
First amendment issues and all?
I deny the petition with regret.
Mr. Gardner?
Yes, Your Honor.
We have a lot of testimony focusing on whether there was a consensual act between Mr. McKeon and my client, but if Mr. McKeon is willing to stipulate there was, indeed, a consensual sexual act, we would forego this testimony.
That's a good point.
Mr. Ericcson, how do you respond?
We will stipulate there was no sex of any kind, forced or consensual, Your Honor.
The plaintiff also requests an expedited trial date,
Your Honor, a DNA sample from Mr. McKeon,
DNA results from the rape kit, and the investigative reports from the state's attorney's office.
They have been... reluctant to furnish them.
Thank you, counselor.
I will grant all four motions.
Mr., uh...
Ericcson?
Ah.
I interpret from Mr. Ericcson's, uh, gesture that he acquiesces.
Well, I'll see you all back here...
Let's see.
My docket is clear.
Five days?
How's that for expedited?
Uh, as a side note, I would like to ask for a moment of silence for the recent mass killings in Darfur.
Okay, thank you.
Court adjourned.
That was a great start, huh?
I understand you're having trouble with the driver.
And you're boxed in on the rape kit.
You should just settle on our terms.
Yeah, right.
See you in trial.
May 15, four months ago.
This one seemed cool.
Hey.
So you know will?
12 clients, stockbroker types.
Mr. Gardner.
You two went to school together?
That's what they were saying the other night at drinks.
Yeah.
So that's why?
Cary, if you don't mind, I've had only a week with this.
You got an expedited trial date to force the other side to settle, and now you guys are the ones suffering.
What are you looking for?
"TZK Industries."
I...
I've seen it somewhere before.
What is TZK Industries?
"TZK Industries."
It's a furniture supply company.
"Supplying elegant furniture
To home and business." Why?
What do you need?
Something to undercut Christy's driver.
Okay.
Oh.
It can't be that easy, can it?
What?
So I find this odd, Mr. Grant.
You were there, and you say there was no rape?
So either you're lying or my client's lying.
All I know is what I saw.
Your Honor, request permission to approach the witness.
Yes.
Please.
Approach.
Mr. Grant, this is a copy of your wife's w-2.
Could you read the name of your wife's employer, please?
"TZK Industries."
And TZK Industries is a company owned by the McKeon family to supply furniture to their properties.
Objection.
Not in evidence.
Well, I think it's all right for it to be asked,
Mr. Ericcson.
I... actually, sustained.
Your Honor, you sustained the objection?
I did.
Mr. Ericcson had a point.
Isn't it an amazing coincidence, Mr. Grant, that after a year of unemployment, your wife got a job in June from the McKeon family, a month after the bachelor party incident?
No.
And why is that, Mr. Grant?
Because my wife and I are divorced.
My wife and I have been separated for a year now, so her getting this job has nothing to do with me.
But, sir, wouldn't you benefit even if only in the form of lowered spousal support?
I guess, but I'm not Warren Buffett.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm sorry.
I didn't see it.
Don't ever let your first chair get undercut like that again.
Good news?
I just got the rape kit results.
State's attorney wasn't stonewalling.
They sent it out to a commercial lab and just got it back.
And?
It's not McKeon's dna.
The rape kit came back.
It's not his sperm.
It's not McKeon's DNA.
Grant says you're lying.
McKeon says you're lying.
I'm not lying.
I...
It's really not his sperm?
Christy, we need to get the full... who else did you have sex with that night?
No one.
I swear.
Well, you obviously had sex with someone because it isn't his sperm.
So, was it a boyfriend or another client?
You need to find Maura.
We can't find Maura.
You really don't remember anything to help us find her?
We can't find Maura.
We didn't talk.
She was on her cell phone the whole night till her battery ran out.
I'm sorry.
I need to get to class.
Not that I mind it, but since when did you become me?
You didn't believe her.
I did.
Maybe she is telling the truth.
Christy said the light was flicked out, so maybe McKeon was with a friend.
So let's see if the cops tested the other party-goers.
Worth a try.
It's not just that.
What's up with your bud, Abernathy?
He's going out of his way to kill us.
You know how this works.
Liberal judge gets on the bench, doesn't want to rule from his bias, so he bends over backwards the other way.
I thought you said you had some pull with him.
He wanted to be on your glass ceiling committee or whatever it is. "Emily's list""
are you suggesting I influence a sitting judge in some untoward fashion?
No, just in a toward one.
Come on, come to the court, let him see your sad little liberal face... and contemplate a life without his friends.
Will, I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
We're a team.
No apologies.
Hey.
Now what are you doing?
Close the door.
Come on, Zach.
Just let it go.
Would you shut up and look at this?
See that?
It's called a "specular highlight."
It's like a light in the eye reflected in the eye.
See where it is?
It's to the left.
And now, look at this.
The lady's eye.
See?
The dot's to the right.
Okay... they're not in the same picture.
Dad's face was photoshopped into it.
Hello?
Zach, Grace, I'm home.
Jackie, I have a request to make.
Certainly, dear.
You want the kids to visit Peter in prison, you talk to me.
You don't talk to Zach.
When did I talk to Zach?
You told him Peter was lonely in prison.
Because he is.
Just don't go around me by talking to my kids.
Hey, mom.
Hey.
How was work?
It was crappy.
I thought I'd make breakfast.
For dinner?
My goodness.
Like when you were little.
You don't have to like it.
It's for me.
So, I want to show you some pictures of where dad's staying.
What?
I want to make sure you know what's involved with visiting dad in prison, okay?
I'll get that.
So, Zach, can you show me how to get to "google images" on your computer?
Yeah, sure.
What is that?
Nothing.
Homework.
Mom!
Someone's here!
Hi.
Still no Maura?
DNA is definitely not from McKeon's semen.
I was going to the crime lab to see if they ever collected DNA from the other party-goers when...
You can watch a little tv.
I'll be right in.
Want to do this later?
No, no, no.
I think I just caught my son checking out porn.
Anyway...
I asked a cop friend to run the rape kit results through codis.
And they got a hit.
Who, the best man?
Manny Lyons.
A rapist serving 20 to life in an Ohio supermax.
I don't understand.
You're in good company.
And he's a convicted rapist.
Christy was raped.
Apparently.
I don't get it.
Was he... was he at the party?
Well, as far as I can tell, he was in a holding cell in Columbus at the time.
This makes no sense.
We know.
This pile is everything on the Manny Lyons rape.
This pile, everything on ours.
And we can't find one thing in common.
No connection with McKeon?
Nope, we checked it.
"Manny Lyons broke into an Upper Arlington apartment, held a knife to the neck of a 40-year-old divorcee, raped her, and stole her car.
He was stopped running a traffic light ten miles away.
The divorcee identified him in a six-pack photo line-up."
What?
They do have one thing in common.
And you were the lab supervisor who worked on analysis 5795... the rape kit in this case... professor?
Doctor.
Doctor.
And these are your initials, "gg""
right at the bottom of the report?
Yes, those are mine.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
This isn't 5795.
Yes, this is 5794.
The Manny Lyons case.
My mistake.
Oh, I see that you ran the analysis on both cases.
Given the sequential numbering,
I imagine that you worked on one right after the other?
It appears so.
In both cases, the DNA matched the same culprit,
Manny Lyons, is that correct?
It is.
So let... let me follow the logic here.
Manny Lyons... who never set foot in Chicago...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
I will sustain that.
Isn't it true, Dr. Girtzman, the only connection between Manny Lyons and Christy barbosa is that you worked on both cases?
Objection.
Argumentative.
Mrs. Florrick, this is not a debating society.
Sustained.
Dr. Girtzman, would you say that the standard of a commercial lab is relaxed?
No.
And, uh, Your Honor, may I answer her earlier question?
Personal privilege.
Oh, yeah, if you'd like.
We handle an immense backlog of untested rape kits from crime labs all across the country.
We do so with speed and professionalism...
And yet isn't it true, sir, that your lab almost lost its accreditation in 2005...
Now, that was never proved!
When it cross-contaminated two DNA samples that were out-sourced from a crime lab...
This is an old slander!
That you failed to sterilize scissors that then carried the DNA from one sample to the next?
I don't have to answer this.
Actually, you do, sir.
Your Honor, given this testimony, we move that the rape kit be reexamined at a second genetic lab.
I think that is an understandable request, Mr. Ericcson.
Your Honor, we would stipulate that Mrs. Florrick has proven her case.
Dr. Girtzman cross-contaminated the sample...
Excuse me?
But we would argue, therefore, that that is the very reason it cannot be tested again.
You've got to be kidding me.
The very fact that it is agreed that the sample is now contaminated means it can't possibly be tested with any authority.
Your Honor...
Mr. Gardner, you argued that the rape kit was contaminated.
You can't now argue it's probative.
The plaintiff's motion for retesting is denied.
Your Honor...!
Motion is denied.
We've got to find that other stripper.
So basically this is a hail mary pass?
Look at you with the sports metaphors.
Yeah, I don't see many other options here.
Good evening.
Do you have a reservation?
Actually, we have a... strange request.
We need to get a printout of a phone bill from four months ago.
The name?
McKeon.
First name?
Lloyd.
Would you liked that e-mailed or a hard copy?
Hard copy.
If I could just see some I.D., Mr. McKeon.
Um, well, actually can I ask you a question...
Rosemary?
There was a bachelor party here in May that resulted in a... a rape.
Were you here then?
I was.
Well, the only person we believe who can corroborate the rape victim's story was using a cell phone that night.
And we're thinking she used the bathroom phone when her battery ran out.
We were hoping to glance at the bill just to see if there was a number she dialed.
I'll have to speak to a manager.
Nice thought.
If all else fails, try honesty.
I got 20 bucks on deception.
Will?
Oh, hey.
What are you doing north of the loop?
You know, just seeing how the other half lives.
Alicia, this is Marlena.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.
Ask for a view of the lake.
It's beautiful at night.
She thinks we're getting a room.
Yep.
Now they all think we're getting a room.
You worried?
You?
We could do worse.
I'm having trouble getting my manager.
If you could just wait another minute.
I owe you $20.
Okay, Christy and Maura arrived at 10:15.
Right there, 11:20.
Out-of-state area code.
Hello.
You don't know me...
Were you the other dancer there that night, Maura?
I was, yes.
And your driver, Mr. Grant, what did he tell you after you took Christy to the hospital?
He told us that the McKeons were very rich, and we should all keep our mouths shut.
And that's why you went back home to Michigan?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I was scared.
And to reiterate,
Christy told you about the rape immediately afterward?
Yes.
In fact, he followed her out intoarking lot and he said, "don't tell anyone.
Just take the money and shut up."
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Alicia.
For... you know.
Christy, I'm just curious.
Where did you meet my husband?
Your husband?
I've never met your husband.
My mistake.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Good afternoon.
I have given this case quite a bit of thought, as you can imagine.
You have both argued your case well.
But I find myself judging in favor of the defendant.
Without a DNA match to the rape kit, we have a classic he-said, she-said; and as much as my personal sympathies lie with the plaintiff, the evidence does not warrant a favorable decision.
Judgment in favor of the defense.
Are you okay?
No.
I'm sorry.
I believe you.
This is all I want to say.
I have been falsely accused by a woman who wanted nothing more than a quick payday.
But every year there are thousands of women who are abused, and I don't think we should let this false accusation...
Mr. McKeon.
You're under arrest for the rape of Christy Barbosa.
Wha...?
Cuff him.
What?
Is this a joke?
It must be hard to lose, Mrs. Florrick.
Not if it forces you to prosecute.
I'm coming out of this with a criminal case I'll win, and you're coming out with a loss.
Nice job.
Lloyd McKeon was arrested today for rape, literally seconds after he was cleared in a civil case for the identical crime.
State's attorney Glenn Childs took credit for finding an untainted sample of DNA that will guarantee McKeon's conviction in a criminal trial.
Childs denied that McKeon's arrest was a reaction to...
This is yours?
Yeah.
Is he going to jail?
I think so.
Well, then that's good.
Thanks.
Good night.
Good night.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to beg.
Please... oh... does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God, please...
You're amazing...
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do to you?
Just... don't... stop.
What'll you give me?
What'll you give me not to stop?
Everything.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
But I do admit to a failure of judgment in my dealings with these women.
I've never abused my office for sexual favors.
Give us time to heal and rebuild their trust.
[BEEPING]
GRACE:
Mom, breakfast!
Oh, hey, congratulations.
That's great.
Your husband, looks like he could get out of prison.
- Looks like it.
- Early Show had a story on it.
- Stuff on you too.
Catch it?
- No, I missed it.
Yeah, I caught it online.
I could send you the link.
- That's okay.
- No, no, no.
It's easy.
Litigation wants me on this new class action.
That's where I'm headed.
What about you?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, in here I guess.
DIANE:
When did you say this was?
CHRISTY:
May 15th.
Four months ago.
WILL:
Do you have anything with the date?
CHRISTY:
A parking receipt.
DIANE:
Had you ever met Mr. McKeon before?
No.
I'd seen his family on the news.
I heard about their hotels and stuff, but that's about it.
WILL:
Well, the problem here, Christy, is that any civil suit could be seen as opportunistic.
CHRISTY:
Because of their money?
- Yes.
I'm sorry, but I didn't choose my rapist.
DIANE:
This kid doesn't know what she's in for, taking on McKeon.
- Alicia, if you don't mind, we need to...
- It's all right.
Stay.
I don't know about this.
It's a criminal case, not a civil one.
Except the new state's attorney rejected the charges.
Yeah, because it's got Duke lacrosse written all over it.
- Oh, come on.
- Put your politics aside, Diane.
You're Glenn Childs, you get this dropped in your lap, a stripper at a bachelor party accusing the son of the most powerful family in Chicago of rape, and you don't think it's Duke lacrosse 2?
He's worried about the McKeon family money.
He's worried about their campaign contributions.
Well, I'm worried that we're overextended.
How many Sheffrin-Marks depos do we have left?
- Two-ten.
- We need to keep our eye on the ball.
And Christy is just gonna look like she's trying to make some quick cash.
Do you believe her?
I believe a lot of things I can't prove.
All right, here's what I think.
I know the McKeon family lawyer.
- Ericcson?
- Right, William Ericcson.
That's just what we need, two Wills.
McKeon's are gonna keep this out of the press.
So my guess is, they throw her some cash.
Maybe 50 grand or so to keep her quiet.
Yeah.
WOMAN:
William Ericcson's office.
- Mr. Ericcson, please.
May I tell him who's calling?
Tell him it's the other Will.
I want you to be at this lunch.
Don't say anything, just listen and look serious.
I can do that.
- How you holding up here?
- I'm holding up.
Oh, yeah.
How do you know her?
- Who?
- Christy?
I don't.
Then why did she ask for you to be on the case?
I don't know.
Ericcson here.
Will.
Will.
I think you know why I'm calling.
Two months ago Peter Florrick was sentenced to ten years for bribery and corruption.
Today was the first step toward his release.
He was known in Chicago simply as The Hammer.
He jailed cop killers, CEO's, corrupt politicians, until The Hammer got hammered.
An hour ago I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
ANNOUNCER:
Within weeks,
Chicago's incorruptible state's attorney found himself with all the trappings of a modern American scandal.
A rival with an eye on his job, an embarrassed wife, a blushing call girl, and an R-rated sex tape.
AMBER:
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
PETER:
Oh, God, please, you are...
- Hey, ever heard the whole thing?
- No.
You're the only one who hasn't.
Everything I have on McKeon.
What?
I beat you three sets to two.
Oh, come on.
You don't even believe that.
This is driving me crazy.
How do I know you?
- Me?
- Minor, Parsons Layton?
Alicia's actually our newest junior associate, one month in.
Will Ericcson, Alicia Florrick.
It's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- You too.
- I'm rooting for your husband.
I know he has a lot of enemies in this town, but I always root for the underdog.
No, no, just ignore him.
The only reason someone's forced out of public office in America these days is sex.
So let's talk about Lloyd McKeon.
So sad, really.
I remember when you had a respectable firm, Will.
One that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these.
And what charges might those be, Will?
I haven't said anything yet.
Do you think you're the first firm she's shopping this lawsuit to?
There's nothing there.
Even the new state's attorney thinks there's nothing there.
And yet I got you to a settlement lunch on a half-hour's notice.
Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage?
- You wanna know what I would say?
- I would.
I would say you're trying to change the subject from rape.
Well, I would agree that as offensive and misguided as these charges are, the optics aren't exactly in our favor, so we're willing to make an offer.
It's non-negotiable.
You have till end of business day.
McKeon did it.
Under 100 thou, I would have said no.
- Over 100 thou...
- How about well over?
If you don't mind my asking, Miss Barbosa, why did you request me?
I saw you on TV.
I thought you'd understand what it's like to be misunderstood.
WILL:
Ladies.
Sorry about that.
McKeon's lawyers made a financial offer that Diane and I actually agree on.
A first.
It's a cash settlement, $450,000.
You're kidding?
We don't have to go to court?
He just offered that?
You'll have to sign a confidentiality agreement.
Both parties free each other of liability and agree not to speak to anyone.
- What?
DIANE:
It's standard in civil agreements.
I want everybody to know he settled.
Can't we tell the police?
DIANE:
Not if we sign a confidentiality agreement.
McKeon could withdraw the award and sue you for defamation.
- What do you think?
- I think under the circum...
[WILL CLEARS THROAT]
I think you're looking for justice, Christy.
And sometimes justice comes in a form we don't expect.
If you take this money, the settlement will be known to the two people that matter most:
You and him.
I'm sorry, no.
He'll know how much it costs to rape somebody and get away with it.
That's all.
This is about him admitting that he did this to me.
She's right.
Okay, Ericcson, how flexible are you on confidentiality?
Exclude new criminal discovery.
Oh, come on.
This isn't...
You wanna go to court, is that it?
Take it as far as pre-trial?
He doesn't wanna go to trial.
Look, Ericcson, you wanna make McKeon The Bachelor Party Rapist, be my...
That's how you wanna play it?
We turned down a half a million bucks.
Feels good, doesn't it?
Looks like we got a case.
You have to size these things up pretty quickly.
Twelve clients.
Stockbroker types.
No one out of control.
It was easy.
They paid $400 for a 90-minute two-girl fantasy strip.
Two-girl?
Who's the other girl?
Maura.
I don't remember her last name.
That was the only time she...
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
Sorry.
She insists on being here during all of this.
It's a nightmare.
KALINDA:
And McKeon, how'd you meet him?
The groom?
He offered me another $100 for a private lap dance.
When I got in the bedroom, he locked the door.
Then he grabbed me.
I tried to get the Mace from my bag.
I tried to shout.
Did you tell anyone afterwards?
Maura, and our driver, Grant.
He suggested she drive me to the hospital for the rape exam.
And the service, Worldwide Elite, how long did you work for them?
- Two years.
- And what else did you do there?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what else did you do there?
For a year, I was an escort.
Didn't you think that might be important to tell us?
I haven't gone on a call in a year.
I was in an abusive relationship.
I needed the money to move out.
When I moved, I stopped working.
But still stripped.
So, what's your point?
A call girl can't get raped?
Yeah, that's my point, thanks.
Look, she lied to us.
Why believe her now?
She walked away from half a million dollars.
And when did she ever lie to us?
The more you bond, the less helpful you are.
Your stripper was hooking.
Why is she my stripper when she does something bad?
[CHUCKLES]
Okay, so the point is to prepare for trial so we don't actually have to go to trial.
- Cary, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice suit.
I got a job for you.
I need you take Alicia's Sheffrin-Marks depos for the week.
- All right, I'm on it.
WILL:
This is settlement poker.
No one wants to go to trial, but the person who plays the better hand makes the better deal.
So get me some good cards.
WOMAN:
And so your first thought is to come to the state's attorney's office.
KALINDA:
I just need one thing.
- And why would I help you with that?
- Because you like me.
- That still works with people?
KALINDA:
Mm.
Like a charm.
LEAH:
You never should have quit.
KALINDA:
I didn't quit.
I was fired.
Come on, you ran a solid rape investigation.
You should be dying to slip us the witness interviews.
Leah, could you come outside for a second?
And you're telling me your husband had nothing to do with this?
Mr. Childs, my law firm is bringing on a civil action, that's all.
To embarrass my office, make it look like I don't care about a rape victim.
A happy coincidence?
I understand the need to blame someone for your husband's downfall.
But I didn't release that sex tape to hurt you or your family.
I have kids too.
You should know, I was holding back.
I had more to release about your husband.
A lot more.
Disturbing things.
But out of compassion, I held back.
Mr. Childs, if you have something to show me, just do it, okay?
Because the one thing I don't have time for these days is empty threats.
You want something on your stripper?
Get a subpoena.
I like Christy.
She was one of my best dancers, but I have nothing else to add.
I'm sorry.
We just need contact information, Ms. Avraski, for the driver and stripper.
Dancer.
Look, I would love...
Because we'd really hate to subpoena your books and client records.
- You're East Indian?
- Yeah.
Hm.
It's very popular these days.
Contact information?
Follow me.
Why A, B, C?
Fifteen hundred an hour, 2,100, and 3,100.
What makes someone more expensive?
Is this about the rape?
No.
Regular clients, and special requests.
Requests?
No condoms.
Or being dominated.
Or role-playing.
Whatever they can't get at home.
People would really pay $3,000 an hour?
The day rate is $31,000, dawn to dawn.
So about this rape, can you get me contact information on this dancer?
Maura?
She quit right afterwards.
Left a fake number, fake address, fake social.
Happens all the time.
What about the driver?
Could you help me find him?
ZACH:
So, Mom, where are you anyway?
ALICIA:
Look, I have to work late tonight.
Can you ask Grandma if she can stay until 10?
Sure.
Grandma, can you stay until 10?
Mom's working late.
No need to shout, dear.
If she has to, she has to.
ZACH:
Grandma can stay.
I was talking to Grandma, and she said she visited Dad this weekend, and he was saying how much he missed us.
[HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Grandma said that?
I was thinking maybe we should be going there.
You know, visiting him.
Your dad didn't want you to see him like that, in prison.
He was...
He didn't want you to worry.
But let me ask him.
Maybe he's changed his mind, okay?
Right.
We'll talk about it when I get home tonight, okay?
All right, see you tonight.
JACKIE:
I trust you're doing your homework.
Five minutes.
- You can corroborate Christy's story?
- Which was?
That she told you about the rape right after it happened.
Look, I like Christy, she's a good tipper, but when she drinks she doesn't know what she's talking about.
But you do.
Christy gave a lap dance, he paid, we went home.
Nobody said anything about rape.
I don't blame Christy for trying to get money out of McKeon.
But, hey, she's lying.
Is that Dad?
I don't know.
But you're thinking it too.
JACKIE:
I'm gonna need your help in a minute.
Dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.
Should we tell Mom?
They sent them to Mom to hurt her, so I say no.
ALICIA:
So?
I don't know, do they wanna see me?
Oh, Zach does, but Grace doesn't?
She's hurt.
She thought you were everything.
So two months in, you seem well.
I am.
There's some good guys here.
There's probably less backstabbing than the State Attorney's Office.
You look good.
It's like it agrees with you.
So here's the thing about Childs.
Everything he does is a political calculation...
Peter, no.
I don't wanna be used.
Alicia, I know you don't believe me, but Childs set me up, and if what I give you can help a rape victim, what's wrong with that?
How do you know she's a rape victim, Peter?
I didn't tell your mom.
Daniel told me.
Your appellate lawyer?
He's the one who referred Christy to you.
What's wrong?
I'm hard-pressed to think what's not wrong.
So he what?
Well, I mentioned to Daniel that you were at Stern, Lockhart, and that if he didn't have time for Christy's case that maybe you would.
I thought you'd want the work.
You thought it was a good idea to send me a hooker to represent?
No, I thought it was a good idea to send you a rape victim.
Oh, my God.
You had sex with her.
What?
You're using her first name, Peter.
You're saying Christy.
She's one of your whores.
Alicia, would you stop it?
When are you gonna stop thinking that I slept with everyone?
When are you gonna forgive me, for God's sake?
How much did you spend on Amber?
You had sex with her, what?
Ten times, 20 times?
You don't wanna know the details of what I did.
If you want me for forgive you, I need to know what I'm forgiving you for.
So at $3,000 a pop, that's what?
Sixty thousand dollars?
Did you pay her not to use a condom?
Was that extra?
Your trip to Houston.
Did you take her with you?
- You know I didn't.
- I don't know what I know.
MAN [OVER PA]:
Attention:
Today's visitation is now over.
Grace's 12th birthday party, you said...
You said you had to leave early.
Where did you go, Peter?
You answer those questions, and then we'll talk about forgiveness.
WILL:
This is a pre-trial hearing, so don't worry about the driver yet.
We just need to win a few motions.
- Sorry.
WILL:
Don't worry about it.
It all comes down to the rape kit.
KALINDA:
Still no luck finding the other stripper.
All we have is a first name, Maura.
And a general description.
We need to box McKeon in.
There's only one of two ways his semen ends up that rape kit.
Consensual sex or rape.
We get him to swear there was no consensual sex.
Why would he do that?
Because he has a wife.
WILL:
There you are.
How you doing?
You nervous?
CHRISTY:
No, but maybe I should be?
WILL:
This is just a pre-trial hearing.
The state's attorney is trying to squash our subpoena.
We get the ground rules straight in case this thing goes to trial.
Kalinda, get in the state's attorney's office, and wait for the subpoena.
I'll do that.
What?
You don't have to.
I know.
I'll be back.
- You all right?
- Yeah, sure.
I'm fine.
Oh, my God.
This is too good.
We've got Judge Abernathy.
He's our newest judge.
He's so liberal, he makes Michael Moore look like Rush Limbaugh.
Justice may be blind, but judges sure aren't.
God, Ericcson must be pulling his hair out.
MAN:
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Oh, please don't stand, everybody.
Sit back down, please.
We've got a big room here, don't we?
Your Honor, given the stature of my client, Mr. McKeon, and given the fact that this pre-trial hearing has already garnered the attention of our friends in the press, we ask the court to seal the pre-trial filings and avoid a show trial.
Oh, Mr. Ericcson, I don't think we need to do all that, do we?
First Amendment issues and all?
I deny the petition with regret.
- Mr. Gardner?
- Yes, Your Honor.
We have a lot of testimony focusing on whether there was a consensual act between Mr. McKeon and my client.
But if Mr. McKeon is willing to stipulate there was a consensual sexual act, we would forego this testimony.
That's a good point.
Mr. Ericcson, how do you respond?
We would stipulate there was no sex of any kind, forced or consensual, Your Honor.
The plaintiff requests an expedited trial date, Your Honor.
A DNA sample from Mr. McKeon, DNA results from the rape kit, and the reports from the state's attorney.
They have been reluctant to furnish them.
Thank you, counselor, I will grant all four motions.
Mr. Ericcson?
I interpret from Mr. Ericcson's gesture that he acquiesces.
Well, I'll see you all back here...
Let's see, my docket is clear.
Five days?
How's that for expedited?
As a side note,
I would like to ask for a moment of silence for the recent mass killings in Darfur.
Okay, thank you.
Court adjourned.
That was a great start, huh?
ERICCSON:
You're having trouble with the driver?
WILL:
You've boxed in on the rape kit.
You should settle on our terms.
ERICCSON:
Yeah, right.
WILL:
See you in trial.
May 15th, four months ago.
This one seemed cool, this one...
- Hey, so you know Will?
- Twelve clients.
Stockbroker types.
You two went to school together?
That's what they were saying the other night at drinks.
ALICIA:
Yeah.
- So that's why.
Cary, if you don't mind, I've had only a week with this.
You've got an expedited trial date to force the other side to settle and now you guys are the ones suffering.
- What are you looking for?
- TZK Industries.
I've seen it somewhere before.
What is TZK Industries?
TZK Industries.
CARY:
It's a furniture supply company, supplying elegant furniture.
Why, what do you need?
ALICIA:
Something to undercut Christy's driver.
CARY:
Okay.
Oh.
It can't be that easy, can it?
What?
WILL:
Now, I find this odd, Mr. Grant.
You were there, and you say there was no rape.
So either you're lying or my client's lying.
All I know is what I saw, sir.
Request permission to approach the witness.
Yes, please.
Approach.
WILL:
Mr. Grant, this is a copy of your wife's W-2.
Could you read the name of your wife's employer, please?
"TZK Industries."
WILL:
And TZK Industries is a company owned by the McKeon family to supply furniture to...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
Well, I think it's all right for it to be asked, Mr. Ericcson.
L...
Actually, sustained.
You sustained the objection?
I did.
Mr. Ericcson has a point.
Isn't it an amazing coincidence, Mr. Grant, that after a year of unemployment your wife got a job in June, from the McKeon family, a month after the bachelor party incident?
- No.
- And why is that, Mr. Grant?
Because my wife and I are divorced.
My wife and I have been separated for a year now.
So her getting this job has nothing to do with me.
But, sir, wouldn't you benefit, even if only in the form of lowered spousal support?
I guess, but I'm not Warren Buffet.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm sorry, I didn't see it.
Don't ever let your first chair get undercut like that again.
ALICIA:
Good news?
I just got the rape kit results.
The state's attorney wasn't stonewalling.
They sent it out to a commercial lab and just got it back.
And?
It's not McKeon's DNA.
The rape kit came back.
It's not his sperm.
It's not McKeon's DNA.
Grant says you're lying.
- McKeon says you're lying.
- I'm not lying.
L...
- It's really not his sperm?
- Christy, we need to get the full...
- Who else did you have sex with?
- No one, I swear.
Well, you obviously had sex with someone because it isn't his sperm.
So was it a boyfriend?
Or another client?
You need to find Maura.
We can't find Maura.
You really don't remember anything that could help us find her?
We didn't talk.
She was on her cell phone the whole night until her battery ran out.
I'm sorry,
I need to get to class.
Not that I mind it, but since when did you become me?
- You didn't believe her, I did.
- Maybe she is telling the truth.
Christy said the light was flicked out, so maybe McKeon was with a friend.
So let's see if the cops tested the other party-goers.
Worth a try.
It's not just that.
What's up with your bud, Abernathy?
He's going out of his way to kill us.
Liberal judge gets on the bench, doesn't want to rule from his bias, so he bends the other way.
You said you had some pull.
He wanted to be on your Glass Ceiling committee.
Emily's List.
Are you suggesting I influence a sitting judge in some untoward fashion?
WILL:
No, just in a toward one.
Come on, come to the court, let him see your sad little liberal face and contemplate a life without his friends.
Will, I'm so sorry.
Don't be, we're a team.
No apologies.
Hey.
Now what are you doing?
- Close the door.
- Come on, Zach, just let it go.
Would you shut up and look at this?
You see that?
It's called a specular highlight.
It's like a light in the eye, reflected in the eye.
See where it is?
It's to the left.
Now, look at this.
The lady's eye.
See?
The dot is to the right.
- Okay.
- They're not in the same picture.
Dad's face was Photoshopped into it.
ALICIA:
Hello?
Zach, Grace, I'm home.
Jackie, I have a request to make.
Certainly, dear.
If you want the kids to visit Peter in prison, you talk to me.
- You don't talk to Zach.
- When did I talk to Zach?
You told him Peter was lonely.
Because he is.
Just don't go around me by talking to my kids.
ZACH:
Hey, Mom.
ALICIA:
Hey.
- How was work?
- It was crappy.
I thought I'd make breakfast.
JACKIE:
For dinner?
My goodness.
Like when you were little.
You don't have to like it.
It's for me.
So I wanna show you some pictures of where Dad's staying.
What?
I wanna make sure you know what's involved with visiting Dad in prison, okay?
I'll get that.
So, Zach, can you show me how to get to Google images on your computer?
Yeah, sure.
What is that?
Nothing.
Homework.
GRACE:
Mom?
Someone's here.
Hi.
Still no Maura?
KALINDA:
DNA is definitely not from McKeon's semen.
I was going to the crime lab to see if they ever collected DNA from the other party-goers when...
You can watch a little TV.
I'll be right in.
Wanna do this later?
No, no, no.
I think I just caught my son checking out porn.
Anyway, I asked a cop friend to run the rape kit results through CODIS.
And they got a hit.
Who?
The best man?
Manny Lyons.
A rapist serving 20-to-life in an Ohio supermax.
- I don't understand.
- You're in good company.
And he's a convicted rapist.
So Christy was raped.
Apparently.
I don't get it.
Was he...?
Was he at the party?
As far as I can tell, he was in the holding cell in Columbus at the time.
This makes no sense.
We know.
This pile is everything on the Manny Lyons rape.
This pile, everything on ours.
And we can't find one thing in common.
No connection with McKeon?
No.
We checked it.
"Manny Lyons broke into an upper Arlington apartment, held a knife to the neck of a 40-year divorcee, raped her, and stole her car.
He was stopped running a traffic light ten miles away.
The divorcee identified him in a six-pack photo lineup."
What?
They do have one thing in common.
And you're the lab supervisor who worked on analysis 5795.
The rape kit in this case, professor?
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
And these are your initials, G.G., right at the bottom of the report?
Yes, those are mine.
Oh, excuse me.
This isn't 5795, this is 5794.
The Manny Lyons case.
My mistake.
Oh, I see that you ran the analysis on both cases.
Given the sequential numbering,
I imagine that you worked on one right after the other.
It appears so.
In both cases, the DNA matched the same culprit, Manny Lyons, is that correct?
- It is.
- So let...
Let me follow the logic here.
Manny Lyons, who never set foot in Chicago...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
I will sustain that.
Isn't it true, Dr. Girtzman, the only connection between Manny Lyons and Christy Barbosa is that you worked on both cases?
Objection.
Argumentative.
Mrs. Florrick, this is not a debating society.
Sustained.
Dr. Girtzman, would you say that the standard of a commercial lab is relaxed?
No.
And, Your Honor, may I answer her earlier question, personal privilege?
Oh, yeah, if you'd like.
We handle an immense backlog of untested rape kits from crime labs all across the country.
We do so with speed and professionalism.
And yet isn't it true, sir, that your lab almost lost its accreditation in 2005...
No, that was never proved.
- When you cross-contaminated two DNA samples?
This is an old slander.
That you failed to sterilize scissors, that carried the DNA from one sample to the next?
- I don't have to answer this.
- Actually, you do, sir.
Your Honor, given this testimony, we move that the rape kit be re-examined at a second genetic lab.
I think that is an understandable request, Mr. Ericcson.
Your Honor, we would stipulate that Mrs. Florrick has proven her case.
Dr. Girtzman cross-contaminated the samples.
But we argue that is the very reason they cannot be tested again.
You gotta be kidding me.
The very fact that it is agreed that the sample is now contaminated, means it can't possibly be tested with any authority.
Mr. Gardner, you argued that the rape kit was contaminated.
You can't now argue it's probative.
The plaintiff's motion for retesting is denied.
- Your Honor...
- Motion is denied.
We gotta find that other stripper.
So basically, this is a Hail Mary pass?
Look at you with the sports metaphors.
Yeah, I don't see many other options here.
Good evening, do you have a reservation?
Actually, we have a strange request.
We need to get a printout of a phone bill from four months ago.
- The name?
- McKeon.
First name?
Lloyd.
Would you like that e-mailed or a hard copy?
Hard copy.
If I could just see some ID, Mr. McKeon.
Well, actually, can I ask you a question, Rosemary?
There was a bachelor party here in May that resulted in a rape.
- Were you here then?
- I was.
Well, the only person we believe who can corroborate the rape victim's story was using a cell phone that night, and we're thinking she used the bathroom phone when her battery ran out.
We were hoping to glance at the bill just to see if there was a number she dialed.
I'll have to speak to our manager.
Nice thought.
If all else fails, try honesty.
I got 20 bucks on deception.
- Will?
- Oh, hey.
What are you doing north of the loop?
Oh, you know, seeing how the other half lives.
Alicia, this is Marlana.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
Ask for a view of the lake.
It's beautiful at night.
She thinks we're getting a room.
Yep.
Now they all think we're getting a room.
- You worried?
- You?
We could do worse.
I'm having trouble getting my manager.
If you could just wait another minute.
I owe you 20.
Okay, Christy and Maura arrived at 10:15.
Right there, 11:20.
Out of state area code.
WILL:
Hello, you don't know me...
Were you the other dancer there that night, Maura?
I was, yes.
WILL:
And your driver, Mr. Grant, what did he tell you after you took Christy to the hospital?
He told us that the McKeons were very rich and we should all keep our mouth shut.
WILL:
And that's why you went home to Michigan?
Yes.
- I'm sorry, I was scared.
- [MOUTHS] It's okay.
WILL:
And to reiterate,
Christy told you about the rape immediately afterward?
Yes, in fact, he followed her out into the parking lot.
And he said, "Don't tell anyone.
Just take the money and shut up."
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Alicia, for, you know...
Christy, I'm just curious.
Where did you meet my husband?
Your husband?
I've never met your husband.
My mistake.
BAILIFF:
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
ABERNATHY:
Good afternoon.
I have given this case quite a bit of thought, as you can imagine.
You have both argued your case well, but I find myself judging in favor of the defendant.
Without a DNA match to the rape kit, we have a classic "he said, she said."
And as much as my personal sympathies lie with the plaintiff, the evidence does not warrant a favorable decision.
Judgment in favor of the defense.
Are you okay?
No.
I'm sorry.
I believe you.
MAN 1:
There he is.
Lloyd, tell us what happened.
MAN 2:
Do you feel you can get your good name back?
This is all I wanna say.
I have been falsely accused by a woman who wanted nothing more than a quick pay day.
But every year, there are thousands of women who are abused, and I don't think we should let this false accusation...
Mr. McKeon, you are under arrest for the rape of Christy Barbosa.
- What?
- Cuff him.
- What?
- What's going on?
McKEON:
Is this a joke?
[CHATTERING]
CHILDS:
It must be hard to lose, Mrs. Florrick.
Not if it forces you to prosecute.
I'm coming out of this with a criminal case I'll win.
You're coming out with a loss.
Nice job.
MAN [ON TV]:
Lloyd McKeon was arrested today for rape literally seconds after he was cleared in a civil case for the identical crime.
State's Attorney Glenn Childs took credit for finding an untainted sample of DNA that will guarantee McKeon's conviction in a criminal trial.
Childs denied that McKeon's arrest...
This is yours?
Yeah.
Is he going to jail?
I think so.
Well, then, that's good.
Thanks.
JACKIE:
Good night.
- Good night.
AMBER [ON RECORDING]:
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
PETER:
Oh, God.
Please.
You are amazing.
AMBER:
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do to you?
PETER:
Just don't stop.
AMBER:
What'll you give me?
What'll you give me not to stop?
PETER:
Everything.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of cook county.
Are you still involved with prostitutes, sir?
Thanks for playing the breadwinner for a while.
It's not gonna last forever.
I just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity.
Glad you could come aboard.
Not only are you coming back to the workplace fairly late, but you have some very prominent baggage.
But, hey, if she can do it, so can you.
Kalinda Sharma.
Oh, the investigator.
You're Peter Florrick's wife.
That's right.
Last time I was in court was 13 years ago.
Wow, I was 12.
State's attorney's here.
I'm glenn Childs.
Peter blames me for his downfall.
Don't make yourself collateral damage here.
The day you leaked that sex tape to the press and forced me to shield my children, that was the day I became collateral damage.
You've obviously never made a woman angry before.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of cook county.
but I do admit to a failure of judgment in my dealings with these women.
I've never abused my office for sexual favors.
Give us time to heal and rebuild their trust... trust...
Mom, breakfast!
Oh, hey, congratulations.
That's great.
Your husband, looks like he could get out of prison.
- Looks like it.
- Early Show had a story on it.
- Stuff on you too.
Catch it?
- No, I missed it.
Yeah, I caught it online.
I could send you the link.
- That's okay.
- No, no, no.
It's easy.
Litigation wants me on this new class action.
That's where I'm headed.
What about you?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, in here I guess.
When did you say this was?
May 15th.
Four months ago.
Do you have anything with the date?
A parking receipt.
Had you ever met Mr. McKeon before?
No.
I'd seen his family on the news.
I heard about their hotels and stuff, but that's about it.
Well, the problem here, Christy, is that any civil suit could be seen as opportunistic.
Because of their money?
- Yes.
I'm sorry, but I didn't choose my rapist.
This kid doesn't know what she's in for, taking on McKeon.
- Alicia, if you don't mind, we need to...
- It's all right.
Stay.
I don't know about this.
It's a criminal case, not a civil one.
Except the new state's attorney rejected the charges.
Yeah, because it's got Duke lacrosse written all over it.
- Oh, come on.
- Put your politics aside, Diane.
You're Glenn Childs, you get this dropped in your lap, a stripper at a bachelor party accusing the son of the most powerful family in Chicago of rape, and you don't think it's Duke lacrosse 2?
He's worried about the McKeon family money.
He's worried about their campaign contributions.
Well, I'm worried that we're overextended.
How many Sheffrin-Marks depos do we have left?
- Two-ten.
- We need to keep our eye on the ball.
And Christy is just gonna look like she's trying to make some quick cash.
Do you believe her?
I believe a lot of things I can't prove.
All right, here's what I think.
I know the McKeon family lawyer.
- Ericcson?
- Right, William Ericcson.
That's just what we need, two Wills.
McKeon's are gonna keep this out of the press.
So my guess is, they throw her some cash.
Maybe 50 grand or so to keep her quiet.
Yeah.
William Ericcson's office.
- Mr. Ericcson, please.
May I tell him who's calling?
Tell him it's the other Will.
I want you to be at this lunch.
Don't say anything, just listen and look serious.
I can do that.
- How you holding up here?
- I'm holding up.
Oh, yeah.
How do you know her?
- Who?
- Christy?
I don't.
Then why did she ask for you to be on the case?
I don't know.
Ericcson here.
Will.
Will.
I think you know why I'm calling.
Two months ago Peter Florrick was sentenced to ten years for bribery and corruption.
Today was the first step toward his release.
He was known in Chicago simply as The Hammer.
He jailed cop killers, CEO's, corrupt politicians, until The Hammer got hammered.
An hour ago I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
Within weeks,
Chicago's incorruptible state's attorney found himself with all the trappings of a modern American scandal.
A rival with an eye on his job, an embarrassed wife, a blushing call girl, and an R-rated sex tape.
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God, please, you are...
- Hey, ever heard the whole thing?
- No.
You're the only one who hasn't.
Everything I have on McKeon.
What?
I beat you three sets to two.
Oh, come on.
You don't even believe that.
This is driving me crazy.
How do I know you?
- Me?
- Minor, Parsons Layton?
Alicia's actually our newest junior associate, one month in.
Will Ericcson, Alicia Florrick.
It's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- You too.
- I'm rooting for your husband.
I know he has a lot of enemies in this town, but I always root for the underdog.
No, no, just ignore him.
The only reason someone's forced out of public office in America these days is sex.
So let's talk about Lloyd McKeon.
So sad, really.
I remember when you had a respectable firm, Will.
One that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these.
And what charges might those be, Will?
I haven't said anything yet.
Do you think you're the first firm she's shopping this lawsuit to?
There's nothing there.
Even the new state's attorney thinks there's nothing there.
And yet I got you to a settlement lunch on a half-hour's notice.
Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage?
- You wanna know what I would say?
- I would.
I would say you're trying to change the subject from rape.
Well, I would agree that as offensive and misguided as these charges are, the optics aren't exactly in our favor, so we're willing to make an offer.
It's non-negotiable.
You have till end of business day.
McKeon did it.
Under 100 thou, I would have said no.
- Over 100 thou...
- How about well over?
If you don't mind my asking, Miss Barbosa, why did you request me?
I saw you on TV.
I thought you'd understand what it's like to be misunderstood.
Ladies.
Sorry about that.
McKeon's lawyers made a financial offer that Diane and I actually agree on.
A first.
It's a cash settlement, $450,000.
You're kidding?
We don't have to go to court?
He just offered that?
You'll have to sign a confidentiality agreement.
Both parties free each other of liability and agree not to speak to anyone.
- What?
It's standard in civil agreements.
I want everybody to know he settled.
Can't we tell the police?
Not if we sign a confidentiality agreement.
McKeon could withdraw the award and sue you for defamation.
- What do you think?
- I think under the circum...
I think you're looking for justice, Christy.
And sometimes justice comes in a form we don't expect.
If you take this money, the settlement will be known to the two people that matter most:
You and him.
I'm sorry, no.
He'll know how much it costs to rape somebody and get away with it.
That's all.
This is about him admitting that he did this to me.
She's right.
Okay, Ericcson, how flexible are you on confidentiality?
Exclude new criminal discovery.
Oh, come on.
This isn't...
You wanna go to court, is that it?
Take it as far as pre-trial?
He doesn't wanna go to trial.
Look, Ericcson, you wanna make McKeon The Bachelor Party Rapist, be my...
That's how you wanna play it?
We turned down a half a million bucks.
Feels good, doesn't it?
Looks like we got a case.
You have to size these things up pretty quickly.
Twelve clients.
Stockbroker types.
No one out of control.
It was easy.
They paid $400 for a 90-minute two-girl fantasy strip.
Two-girl?
Who's the other girl?
Maura.
I don't remember her last name.
That was the only time she...
Sorry.
She insists on being here during all of this.
It's a nightmare.
And McKeon, how'd you meet him?
The groom?
He offered me another $100 for a private lap dance.
When I got in the bedroom, he locked the door.
Then he grabbed me.
I tried to get the Mace from my bag.
I tried to shout.
Did you tell anyone afterwards?
Maura, and our driver, Grant.
He suggested she drive me to the hospital for the rape exam.
And the service, Worldwide Elite, how long did you work for them?
- Two years.
- And what else did you do there?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what else did you do there?
For a year, I was an escort.
Didn't you think that might be important to tell us?
I haven't gone on a call in a year.
I was in an abusive relationship.
I needed the money to move out.
When I moved, I stopped working.
But still stripped.
So, what's your point?
A call girl can't get raped?
Yeah, that's my point, thanks.
Look, she lied to us.
Why believe her now?
She walked away from half a million dollars.
And when did she ever lie to us?
The more you bond, the less helpful you are.
Your stripper was hooking.
Why is she my stripper when she does something bad?
Okay, so the point is to prepare for trial so we don't actually have to go to trial.
- Cary, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice suit.
I got a job for you.
I need you take Alicia's Sheffrin-Marks depos for the week.
- All right, I'm on it.
This is settlement poker.
No one wants to go to trial, but the person who plays the better hand makes the better deal.
So get me some good cards.
And so your first thought is to come to the state's attorney's office.
I just need one thing.
- And why would I help you with that?
- Because you like me.
- That still works with people?
Mm.
Like a charm.
You never should have quit.
I didn't quit.
I was fired.
Come on, you ran a solid rape investigation.
You should be dying to slip us the witness interviews.
Leah, could you come outside for a second?
And you're telling me your husband had nothing to do with this?
Mr. Childs, my law firm is bringing on a civil action, that's all.
To embarrass my office, make it look like I don't care about a rape victim.
A happy coincidence?
I understand the need to blame someone for your husband's downfall.
But I didn't release that sex tape to hurt you or your family.
I have kids too.
You should know, I was holding back.
I had more to release about your husband.
A lot more.
Disturbing things.
But out of compassion, I held back.
Mr. Childs, if you have something to show me, just do it, okay?
Because the one thing I don't have time for these days is empty threats.
You want something on your stripper?
Get a subpoena.
I like Christy.
She was one of my best dancers, but I have nothing else to add.
I'm sorry.
We just need contact information, Ms. Avraski, for the driver and stripper.
Dancer.
Look, I would love...
Because we'd really hate to subpoena your books and client records.
- You're East Indian?
- Yeah.
Hm.
It's very popular these days.
Contact information?
Follow me.
Why A, B, C?
Fifteen hundred an hour, 2,100, and 3,100.
What makes someone more expensive?
Is this about the rape?
No.
Regular clients, and special requests.
Requests?
No condoms.
Or being dominated.
Or role-playing.
Whatever they can't get at home.
People would really pay $3,000 an hour?
The day rate is $31,000, dawn to dawn.
So about this rape, can you get me contact information on this dancer?
Maura?
She quit right afterwards.
Left a fake number, fake address, fake social.
Happens all the time.
What about the driver?
Could you help me find him?
So, Mom, where are you anyway?
Look, I have to work late tonight.
Can you ask Grandma if she can stay until 10?
Sure.
Grandma, can you stay until 10?
Mom's working late.
No need to shout, dear.
If she has to, she has to.
Grandma can stay.
I was talking to Grandma, and she said she visited Dad this weekend, and he was saying how much he missed us.
Grandma said that?
I was thinking maybe we should be going there.
You know, visiting him.
Your dad didn't want you to see him like that, in prison.
He was...
He didn't want you to worry.
But let me ask him.
Maybe he's changed his mind, okay?
Right.
We'll talk about it when I get home tonight, okay?
All right, see you tonight.
I trust you're doing your homework.
Five minutes.
- You can corroborate Christy's story?
- Which was?
That she told you about the rape right after it happened.
Look, I like Christy, she's a good tipper, but when she drinks she doesn't know what she's talking about.
But you do.
Christy gave a lap dance, he paid, we went home.
Nobody said anything about rape.
I don't blame Christy for trying to get money out of McKeon.
But, hey, she's lying.
Is that Dad?
I don't know.
But you're thinking it too.
I'm gonna need your help in a minute.
Dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.
Should we tell Mom?
They sent them to Mom to hurt her, so I say no.
So?
I don't know, do they wanna see me?
Oh, Zach does, but Grace doesn't?
She's hurt.
She thought you were everything.
So two months in, you seem well.
I am.
There's some good guys here.
There's probably less backstabbing than the State Attorney's Office.
You look good.
It's like it agrees with you.
So here's the thing about Childs.
Everything he does is a political calculation...
Peter, no.
I don't wanna be used.
Alicia, I know you don't believe me, but Childs set me up, and if what I give you can help a rape victim, what's wrong with that?
How do you know she's a rape victim, Peter?
I didn't tell your mom.
Daniel told me.
Your appellate lawyer?
He's the one who referred Christy to you.
What's wrong?
I'm hard-pressed to think what's not wrong.
So he what?
Well, I mentioned to Daniel that you were at Stern, Lockhart, and that if he didn't have time for Christy's case that maybe you would.
I thought you'd want the work.
You thought it was a good idea to send me a hooker to represent?
No, I thought it was a good idea to send you a rape victim.
Oh, my God.
You had sex with her.
What?
You're using her first name, Peter.
You're saying Christy.
She's one of your whores.
Alicia, would you stop it?
When are you gonna stop thinking that I slept with everyone?
When are you gonna forgive me, for God's sake?
How much did you spend on Amber?
You had sex with her, what?
Ten times, 20 times?
You don't wanna know the details of what I did.
If you want me for forgive you, I need to know what I'm forgiving you for.
So at $3,000 a pop, that's what?
Sixty thousand dollars?
Did you pay her not to use a condom?
Was that extra?
Your trip to Houston.
Did you take her with you?
- You know I didn't.
- I don't know what I know.
Attention:
Today's visitation is now over.
Grace's 12th birthday party, you said...
You said you had to leave early.
Where did you go, Peter?
You answer those questions, and then we'll talk about forgiveness.
This is a pre-trial hearing, so don't worry about the driver yet.
We just need to win a few motions.
- Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
It all comes down to the rape kit.
Still no luck finding the other stripper.
All we have is a first name, Maura.
And a general description.
We need to box McKeon in.
There's only one of two ways his semen ends up that rape kit.
Consensual sex or rape.
We get him to swear there was no consensual sex.
Why would he do that?
Because he has a wife.
There you are.
How you doing?
You nervous?
No, but maybe I should be?
This is just a pre-trial hearing.
The state's attorney is trying to squash our subpoena.
We get the ground rules straight in case this thing goes to trial.
Kalinda, get in the state's attorney's office, and wait for the subpoena.
I'll do that.
What?
You don't have to.
I know.
I'll be back.
- You all right?
- Yeah, sure.
I'm fine.
Oh, my God.
This is too good.
We've got Judge Abernathy.
He's our newest judge.
He's so liberal, he makes Michael Moore look like Rush Limbaugh.
Justice may be blind, but judges sure aren't.
God, Ericcson must be pulling his hair out.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Oh, please don't stand, everybody.
Sit back down, please.
We've got a big room here, don't we?
Your Honor, given the stature of my client, Mr. McKeon, and given the fact that this pre-trial hearing has already garnered the attention of our friends in the press, we ask the court to seal the pre-trial filings and avoid a show trial.
Oh, Mr. Ericcson, I don't think we need to do all that, do we?
First Amendment issues and all?
I deny the petition with regret.
- Mr. Gardner?
- Yes, Your Honor.
We have a lot of testimony focusing on whether there was a consensual act between Mr. McKeon and my client.
But if Mr. McKeon is willing to stipulate there was a consensual sexual act, we would forego this testimony.
That's a good point.
Mr. Ericcson, how do you respond?
We would stipulate there was no sex of any kind, forced or consensual, Your Honor.
The plaintiff requests an expedited trial date, Your Honor.
A DNA sample from Mr. McKeon, DNA results from the rape kit, and the reports from the state's attorney.
They have been reluctant to furnish them.
Thank you, counselor, I will grant all four motions.
Mr. Ericcson?
I interpret from Mr. Ericcson's gesture that he acquiesces.
Well, I'll see you all back here...
Let's see, my docket is clear.
Five days?
How's that for expedited?
As a side note,
I would like to ask for a moment of silence for the recent mass killings in Darfur.
Okay, thank you.
Court adjourned.
That was a great start, huh?
You're having trouble with the driver?
You've boxed in on the rape kit.
You should settle on our terms.
Yeah, right.
See you in trial.
May 15th, four months ago.
This one seemed cool, this one...
- Hey, so you know Will?
- Twelve clients.
Stockbroker types.
You two went to school together?
That's what they were saying the other night at drinks.
Yeah.
- So that's why.
Cary, if you don't mind, I've had only a week with this.
You've got an expedited trial date to force the other side to settle and now you guys are the ones suffering.
- What are you looking for?
- TZK Industries.
I've seen it somewhere before.
What is TZK Industries?
TZK Industries.
It's a furniture supply company, supplying elegant furniture.
Why, what do you need?
Something to undercut Christy's driver.
Okay.
Oh.
It can't be that easy, can it?
What?
Now, I find this odd, Mr. Grant.
You were there, and you say there was no rape.
So either you're lying or my client's lying.
All I know is what I saw, sir.
Request permission to approach the witness.
Yes, please.
Approach.
Mr. Grant, this is a copy of your wife's W-2.
Could you read the name of your wife's employer, please?
"TZK Industries."
And TZK Industries is a company owned by the McKeon family to supply furniture to...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
Well, I think it's all right for it to be asked, Mr. Ericcson.
L...
Actually, sustained.
You sustained the objection?
I did.
Mr. Ericcson has a point.
Isn't it an amazing coincidence, Mr. Grant, that after a year of unemployment your wife got a job in June, from the McKeon family, a month after the bachelor party incident?
- No.
- And why is that, Mr. Grant?
Because my wife and I are divorced.
My wife and I have been separated for a year now.
So her getting this job has nothing to do with me.
But, sir, wouldn't you benefit, even if only in the form of lowered spousal support?
I guess, but I'm not Warren Buffet.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm sorry, I didn't see it.
Don't ever let your first chair get undercut like that again.
Good news?
I just got the rape kit results.
The state's attorney wasn't stonewalling.
They sent it out to a commercial lab and just got it back.
And?
It's not McKeon's DNA.
The rape kit came back.
It's not his sperm.
It's not McKeon's DNA.
Grant says you're lying.
- McKeon says you're lying.
- I'm not lying.
L...
- It's really not his sperm?
- Christy, we need to get the full...
- Who else did you have sex with?
- No one, I swear.
Well, you obviously had sex with someone because it isn't his sperm.
So was it a boyfriend?
Or another client?
You need to find Maura.
We can't find Maura.
You really don't remember anything that could help us find her?
We didn't talk.
She was on her cell phone the whole night until her battery ran out.
I'm sorry,
I need to get to class.
Not that I mind it, but since when did you become me?
- You didn't believe her, I did.
- Maybe she is telling the truth.
Christy said the light was flicked out, so maybe McKeon was with a friend.
So let's see if the cops tested the other party-goers.
Worth a try.
It's not just that.
What's up with your bud, Abernathy?
He's going out of his way to kill us.
Liberal judge gets on the bench, doesn't want to rule from his bias, so he bends the other way.
You said you had some pull.
He wanted to be on your Glass Ceiling committee.
Emily's List.
Are you suggesting I influence a sitting judge in some untoward fashion?
No, just in a toward one.
Come on, come to the court, let him see your sad little liberal face and contemplate a life without his friends.
Will, I'm so sorry.
Don't be, we're a team.
No apologies.
Hey.
Now what are you doing?
- Close the door.
- Come on, Zach, just let it go.
Would you shut up and look at this?
You see that?
It's called a specular highlight.
It's like a light in the eye, reflected in the eye.
See where it is?
It's to the left.
Now, look at this.
The lady's eye.
See?
The dot is to the right.
- Okay.
- They're not in the same picture.
Dad's face was Photoshopped into it.
Hello?
Zach, Grace, I'm home.
Jackie, I have a request to make.
Certainly, dear.
If you want the kids to visit Peter in prison, you talk to me.
- You don't talk to Zach.
- When did I talk to Zach?
You told him Peter was lonely.
Because he is.
Just don't go around me by talking to my kids.
Hey, Mom.
Hey.
- How was work?
- It was crappy.
I thought I'd make breakfast.
For dinner?
My goodness.
Like when you were little.
You don't have to like it.
It's for me.
So I wanna show you some pictures of where Dad's staying.
What?
I wanna make sure you know what's involved with visiting Dad in prison, okay?
I'll get that.
So, Zach, can you show me how to get to Google images on your computer?
Yeah, sure.
What is that?
Nothing.
Homework.
Mom?
Someone's here.
Hi.
Still no Maura?
DNA is definitely not from McKeon's semen.
I was going to the crime lab to see if they ever collected DNA from the other party-goers when...
You can watch a little TV.
I'll be right in.
Wanna do this later?
No, no, no.
I think I just caught my son checking out porn.
Anyway, I asked a cop friend to run the rape kit results through CODIS.
And they got a hit.
Who?
The best man?
Manny Lyons.
A rapist serving 20-to-life in an Ohio supermax.
- I don't understand.
- You're in good company.
And he's a convicted rapist.
So Christy was raped.
Apparently.
I don't get it.
Was he...?
Was he at the party?
As far as I can tell, he was in the holding cell in Columbus at the time.
This makes no sense.
We know.
This pile is everything on the Manny Lyons rape.
This pile, everything on ours.
And we can't find one thing in common.
No connection with McKeon?
No.
We checked it.
"Manny Lyons broke into an upper Arlington apartment, held a knife to the neck of a 40-year divorcee, raped her, and stole her car.
He was stopped running a traffic light ten miles away.
The divorcee identified him in a six-pack photo lineup."
What?
They do have one thing in common.
And you're the lab supervisor who worked on analysis 5795.
The rape kit in this case, professor?
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
And these are your initials, G.G., right at the bottom of the report?
Yes, those are mine.
Oh, excuse me.
This isn't 5795, this is 5794.
The Manny Lyons case.
My mistake.
Oh, I see that you ran the analysis on both cases.
Given the sequential numbering,
I imagine that you worked on one right after the other.
It appears so.
In both cases, the DNA matched the same culprit, Manny Lyons, is that correct?
- It is.
- So let...
Let me follow the logic here.
Manny Lyons, who never set foot in Chicago...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
I will sustain that.
Isn't it true, Dr. Girtzman, the only connection between Manny Lyons and Christy Barbosa is that you worked on both cases?
Objection.
Argumentative.
Mrs. Florrick, this is not a debating society.
Sustained.
Dr. Girtzman, would you say that the standard of a commercial lab is relaxed?
No.
And, Your Honor, may I answer her earlier question, personal privilege?
Oh, yeah, if you'd like.
We handle an immense backlog of untested rape kits from crime labs all across the country.
We do so with speed and professionalism.
And yet isn't it true, sir, that your lab almost lost its accreditation in 2005...
No, that was never proved.
- When you cross-contaminated two DNA samples?
This is an old slander.
That you failed to sterilize scissors, that carried the DNA from one sample to the next?
- I don't have to answer this.
- Actually, you do, sir.
Your Honor, given this testimony, we move that the rape kit be re-examined at a second genetic lab.
I think that is an understandable request, Mr. Ericcson.
Your Honor, we would stipulate that Mrs. Florrick has proven her case.
Dr. Girtzman cross-contaminated the samples.
But we argue that is the very reason they cannot be tested again.
You gotta be kidding me.
The very fact that it is agreed that the sample is now contaminated, means it can't possibly be tested with any authority.
Mr. Gardner, you argued that the rape kit was contaminated.
You can't now argue it's probative.
The plaintiff's motion for retesting is denied.
- Your Honor...
- Motion is denied.
We gotta find that other stripper.
So basically, this is a Hail Mary pass?
Look at you with the sports metaphors.
Yeah, I don't see many other options here.
Good evening, do you have a reservation?
Actually, we have a strange request.
We need to get a printout of a phone bill from four months ago.
- The name?
- McKeon.
First name?
Lloyd.
Would you like that e-mailed or a hard copy?
Hard copy.
If I could just see some ID, Mr. McKeon.
Well, actually, can I ask you a question, Rosemary?
There was a bachelor party here in May that resulted in a rape.
- Were you here then?
- I was.
Well, the only person we believe who can corroborate the rape victim's story was using a cell phone that night, and we're thinking she used the bathroom phone when her battery ran out.
We were hoping to glance at the bill just to see if there was a number she dialed.
I'll have to speak to our manager.
Nice thought.
If all else fails, try honesty.
I got 20 bucks on deception.
- Will?
- Oh, hey.
What are you doing north of the loop?
Oh, you know, seeing how the other half lives.
Alicia, this is Marlana.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
Ask for a view of the lake.
It's beautiful at night.
She thinks we're getting a room.
Yep.
Now they all think we're getting a room.
- You worried?
- You?
We could do worse.
I'm having trouble getting my manager.
If you could just wait another minute.
I owe you 20.
Okay, Christy and Maura arrived at 10:15.
Right there, 11:20.
Out of state area code.
Hello, you don't know me...
Were you the other dancer there that night, Maura?
I was, yes.
And your driver, Mr. Grant, what did he tell you after you took Christy to the hospital?
He told us that the McKeons were very rich and we should all keep our mouth shut.
And that's why you went home to Michigan?
Yes.
- I'm sorry, I was scared.
- It's okay.
And to reiterate,
Christy told you about the rape immediately afterward?
Yes, in fact, he followed her out into the parking lot.
And he said, "Don't tell anyone.
Just take the money and shut up."
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Alicia, for, you know...
Christy, I'm just curious.
Where did you meet my husband?
Your husband?
I've never met your husband.
My mistake.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Good afternoon.
I have given this case quite a bit of thought, as you can imagine.
You have both argued your case well, but I find myself judging in favor of the defendant.
Without a DNA match to the rape kit, we have a classic "he said, she said."
And as much as my personal sympathies lie with the plaintiff, the evidence does not warrant a favorable decision.
Judgment in favor of the defense.
Are you okay?
No.
I'm sorry.
I believe you.
There he is.
Lloyd, tell us what happened.
Do you feel you can get your good name back?
This is all I wanna say.
I have been falsely accused by a woman who wanted nothing more than a quick pay day.
But every year, there are thousands of women who are abused, and I don't think we should let this false accusation...
Mr. McKeon, you are under arrest for the rape of Christy Barbosa.
- What?
- Cuff him.
- What?
- What's going on?
McKEON:
Is this a joke?
It must be hard to lose, Mrs. Florrick.
Not if it forces you to prosecute.
I'm coming out of this with a criminal case I'll win.
You're coming out with a loss.
Nice job.
Lloyd McKeon was arrested today for rape literally seconds after he was cleared in a civil case for the identical crime.
State's Attorney Glenn Childs took credit for finding an untainted sample of DNA that will guarantee McKeon's conviction in a criminal trial.
Childs denied that McKeon's arrest...
This is yours?
Yeah.
Is he going to jail?
I think so.
Well, then, that's good.
Thanks.
Good night.
- Good night.
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God.
Please.
You are amazing.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do to you?
Just don't stop.
What'll you give me?
What'll you give me not to stop?
Everything.

An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of cook county.
Are you still involved with prostitutes, sir?
Thanks for playing the breadwinner for a while.
It's not gonna last forever.
I just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity.
- Glad you could come aboard.
- Not only are you coming back to the workplace fairly late, but you have some very prominent baggage.
But, hey, if she can do it, so can you.
Kalinda Sharma.
- The investigator.
- You're Peter Florrick's wife.
That's right.
Last time I was in court was 13 years ago.
Wow, I was 12.
State's attorney's here.
I'm Glenn Childs.
Peter blames me for his downfall.
Don't make yourself collateral damage here.
The day you leaked that sex tape to the press and forced me to shield my children, that was the day I became collateral damage.
You've obviously never made a woman angry before.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of cook county.
But I do admit to a failure of judgment in my dealings with these women.
I've never abused my office for sexual favors.
Give us time to heal and rebuild their trust...
Mom, breakfast.
Congratulations.
That's great.
Your husband's appeal.
It looks like he could get out of prison any month now,
- Looks like it.
- Early Show had a story on it.
Some good stuff on you, too.
Did you catch it?
- No, missed it.
- I caught it online.
- I can send you the link.
- That's okay.
No, no, no, it's easy.
So litigation wants me on this new class action.
That's where I'm headed.
What about you?
I don't know.
In here, I guess.
When did you say this was?
May 15, four months ago.
- Do you have anything with the date?
- A parking receipt.
Had you ever met Mr. McKeon before?
No.
I'd seen his family on the news.
I heard about their hotels and stuff, but that's about it.
Well, the problem here, Christy, is that any civil suit could be seen as... opportunistic.
Because of their money?
Yes.
I'm sorry, but I didn't choose my rapist.
This kid doesn't know what she's in for.
Taking on the McKeon family...
Alicia, if you don't mind, we just need to.
No, it's all right, stay.
I don't know about this.
It's a criminal case, not a civil one.
Except the new state's attorney rejected the charges.
Because it's got Duke Lacrosse written all over it.
- Come on.
- What come on?
Put your politics aside, Diane.
You're Glenn Childs, you get this dropped in your lap a stripper at a bachelor party accusing the son of the most powerful family in Chicago of rape... and you don't think it's Duke Lacrosse II?
He's worried about the McKeon family money.
He's worried about their campaign contributions.
I'm worried that we're overextended.
How many sheffrin-marks depos o we have left?
- 210.
- 210.
We need to keep our eye on the ball.
And Christy is just gonna look like she's trying to make some quick cash from the McKeon family.
- Do you believe her?
- I believe a lot of things I can't prove.
All right, here's what I think.
I know the McKeon family lawyer.
- Ericcson?
- Right, William Ericcson.
That's just what we need...
two Wills.
The McKeons are gonna want to keep this out of the press, even if he didn't do it.
So my guess is they throw her some cash, maybe 50 grand or so to keep her quiet.
Mr. Ericcson, please.
Tell him it's the other Will.
I want you to be at this lunch.
Don't say anything.
Just listen and look serious.
I can do that.
- How you holding up here?
- I'm holding up.
Oh, yeah, how do you know her?
- Who?
- Christy.
I don't.
Then why did she ask for you to be on the case?
- I don't know.
- Ericcson here.
Will.
Will.
I think you know why I'm calling.
Two months ago, Peter Florrick was sentenced to ten years for bribery and corruption.
Today was the first step toward his release.
He was known in Chicago simply as "the Hammer."
He jailed cop-killers, ceos, corrupt politicians, until "the hammer" got hammered.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
Within weeks, Chicago's incorruptible state's attorney found himself with all the trappings of a modern American scandal:
A rival with an eye on his job, an embarrassed wife, a blushing call girl and an R-rated sex tape.
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God, please.
You are ama...
Hey, ever heard the whole thing?
No.
You're the only one who hasn't.
Everything I have on McKeon.
What?
!
I beat you three sets to two.
Oh, come on, you don't even believe that.
This is driving me crazy.
How do I know you?
- Me?
- Miner, Parsons Layton?
Alicia is actually our newest junior associate.
One month in.
Will Ericcson, Alicia Florrick.
- It is very nice to meet you.
- You, too.
I'm rooting for your husband.
I know he has a lot of enemies in this town, but I always root for the underdog.
Just ignore him.
The only reason someone's forced out of public office in America these days is sex.
So let's talk about Lloyd McKeon.
It's so sad, really.
I remember when you had a respectable firm, Will.
One that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these.
And what charges might those be, Will?
I haven't said anything yet.
Do you think you're the first firm she's shopping this lawsuit to?
There's nothing there.
Even the state's attorney... the new state's attorney... thinks there's nothing there.
And yet I got you to a settlement lunch on a half hour's notice.
Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage?
You want to know what I would say?
I would.
I would say you're trying to change the subject from rape.
I would agree that, as offensive and misguided as these charges are, the optics aren't exactly in our favor.
We're willing to make an offer.
It's nonnegotiable.
You have till end of business day.
McKeon did it.
Under a hundred thou, I would've said no.
Over a hundred thou...
What about well over?
If you don't mind my asking, Ms. Barbosa, why did you request me?
I saw you on tv.
I thought you'd understand what it's like to be misunderstood.
Ladies.
Sorry about that.
McKeon's lawyers made a financial offer that Diane and I actually agree on.
A first.
It's a cash settlement.
$450,000.
You're kidding.
We don't have to go to court?
He just offered that?
You'll have to sign a standard confidentiality agreement.
Both parties free each other of liability and agree not to speak to anyone, including the press.
- What?
- It's standard in civil agreements.
I want everybody to know he settled.
- Can't we tell the police?
- Not if we sign a confidentiality agreement.
McKeon could withdraw the award and sue you for defamation.
What do you think?
I think under the cir...
I think you're looking for justice, Christy.
And sometimes justice comes in a form we don't expect.
If you take this money, the settlement will be known to the two people that matter most, you and him.
I'm sorry, no.
He'll know how much it costs to rape somebody and get away with it, that's all.
This is about him admitting that he did this to me.
She's right.
Okay, Ericcson, how flexible are you on confidentiality?
Exclude new criminal discovery.
Come on, this isn't...
You want to go to court, is that it?
Take it as far as pretrial?
He doesn't want to go to trial.
Look, Ericcson, you want to make McKeon the bachelor party rapist, be my...
That's how you want to play it?
- We just turned down a half million bucks.
- Feels good, doesn't it?
Looks like we got a case.
You have to size these things up pretty quickly. 12 clients, stockbroker types, no one out of control.
It was easy.
They paid $400 for a 90-minute, two-girl fantasy strip.
Two girl?
- Who was the other girl?
- Maura...
I don't remember her last name.
That was the only time she worked.
Sorry.
She insists on being here during all this.
It's a nightmare.
And McKeon, how'd you meet him?
The groom?
He offered me another $100 for a private lap dance.
When I got in the bedroom, he locked the door.
Then he grabbed me.
I tried to get the mace from my bag, tried to shout.
Did you tell anyone afterwards?
Maura.
And our driver Grant.
He was the one who suggested she drive me to the hospital for the rape exam.
And the service, worldwide elite, how long did you work for them?
- 2 years.
- And what else did you do there?
What do you mean?
I mean, what else did you do there?
For a year, I was an escort.
Didn't you think that might be important to tell us?
I haven't gone on a call in a year.
I was in an abusive relationship.
I needed the money to move out.
When I moved, I stopped working.
But still stripped.
So what's your point.
A call girl can't get raped?
That's my point, thanks.
She lied to us.
Why believe her now?
'Cause she walked away from half a million dollars.
When did she ever lie to us?
The more you bond with these clients, the less helpful you are.
Your stripper was hooking.
Why is she my stripper when she does something bad?
Okay, so the point is to prepare for trial so we don't actually have to go to trial.
- Cary, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice suit.
I got a job for you.
I need you to take Alicia's sheffrin-marks depos for the week.
I'm on it.
This is settlement poker.
No one wants to go to trial, but the person who plays the better hand makes the better deal.
So get me some good cards.
So your first thought is to come to the state attorney's office?
- I just need one thing.
- And why do I help you, again?
- Because you like me.
- That still works with people?
Like a charm.
You never should have quit this place.
I didn't quit.
I was fired.
Come on.
You ran a solid rape investigation.
You should be dying to slip us the witness interviews.
Leah, Could you come outside for a second?
You're telling me your husband had nothing to do with this?
Mr. Childs, my law firm is bringing on a civil action, that's all.
Designed to embarrass my office and make it look like
I don't care about a rape victim.
A happy coincidence?
I understand the need to blame someone for your husband's downfall, but I didn't release that sex tape to hurt you or your family.
I have kids, too.
And you should know
I was holding back.
I had more to release about your husband, a lot more.
Disturbing things, but out of compassion, I held back.
Mr. Childs, if you have something to show me, just do it, okay?
'Cause the one thing I don't have time for these days is empty threats.
You want something on your stripper?
Get a subpoena.
I liked Christy.
She was one of my best dancers.
But I have nothing else to add.
I'm sorry.
We just need contact information.
That's all, Ms. Avarski,
- for the driver and the stripper.
- Dancer.
- Look, I would love...
- because we'd really hate to subpoena your books and client records.
- You're East Indian?
- Yeah.
It's very popular these days.
Contact information?
Follow me.
Why a-b-c?
$1,500 an hour,
$2,100 and,
$3,100.
What makes someone more expensive?
Is this about the rape?
No.
Regular clients and special requests.
Requests?
No condoms or being dominated or role-playing.
Whatever they can't get at home.
People would really pay $3,000 an hour?
The day rate is $31,000, dawn to dawn.
So about this rape.
Can you get me contact information on this dancer?
Maura?
She quit right afterwards.
Left a fake number, fake address, fake social.
Happens all the time.
What about the driver?
Could you help me find him?
Zach so, mom, where are you, anyway?
I have to work late tonight.
Can you ask grandma if she can stay till 10:00?
Sure.
Grandma, can you stay till 10:00?
Mom's working late.
No need to shout, dear.
If she has to, she has to.
Grandma can stay.
So, mom, I was talking to grandma, and she said she visited dad this weekend, and he was saying how much he missed us.
Grandma said that?
I was thinking maybe we should be going there.
You know, visiting him?
Your dad didn't want you to see him like that in prison.
He was... he didn't want you to worry.
But let me ask him... maybe he's changed his mind, okay?
Right.
We'll talk about it when I get home tonight, okay?
All right, see you tonight.
I trust you're doing your homework.
Five minutes.
We understand you can corroborate Christy's story.
Which was?
That she told you about the rape right after it happened.
I like Christy, she's a good tipper, when she drinks, she doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
But you do?
Christy gave the guy a lap dance, he paid her, we went home.
Nobody said anything about any rape.
I don't blame Christy for trying to get extra money out of McKeon, but, hey, she's lying.
Is that dad?
I don't know.
But you're thinking it, too.
Gonna need your help in a minute.
Dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.
- Do we tell mom?
- They sent them to mom to hurt her.
So I say no.
So?
I don't know.
Do they want to see me?
- Zach does, but Grace doesn't?
- She's hurt.
She thought you were everything.
So two months in, you seem well.
I am.
Some good guys here.
There's probably less backstabbing than the state attorney's office.
You look good.
It's like it agrees with you.
So, here's the thing about Childs.
Everything he does is a political calculation.
- Everything he says...
- Peter, no.
I don't want to be used.
Alicia, I know you don't believe me, but Childs set me up.
And if what I give you can help a rape victim, what's wrong with that?
How do you know she's a rape victim, Peter?
I didn't tell your mom.
Daniel told me.
Your appellate lawyer?
He's the one who referred Christy to you.
What's wrong?
I'm hard-pressed to think what's not wrong.
So he what...?
Well...
I mentioned to Daniel that you were with Stern, Lockhart, and that if he didn't have time for Christy's case that maybe you would.
- I thought you'd want the work.
- You thought it was a good idea to send me a hooker to represent?
No, I thought it was a good idea to send you a rape victim.
Oh, my God.
You had sex with her.
What?
You're using her first name, Peter.
You're saying "Christy."
She's one of your whores.
Alicia, would you stop it?
When are you gonna stop thinking that I slept with everyone?
When are you gonna forgive me, for christ sakes?
How much did you spend on Amber?
You had sex with her, what, 10 times, 20 times?
You don't want to know the details of what I did.
If you want me to forgive you, I need to know what I'm forgiving you for.
So 3,000$ a pop, that's what 60,000$?
Did you pay her not to use a condom?
Was that extra?
Your trip to Houston, did you take her with you?
- You know I didn't.
- I don't know what I know.
Grace's 12th birthday party, you s...
You said you had to leave early.
Where did you go, Peter?
You answer those questions, and then we will talk about forgiveness.
This is a pretrial hearing, so don't worry about the driver yet.
We just need to win a few motions.
Sorry!
Don't worry about it.
It all comes down to the rape kit.
Still no luck finding the other stripper.
All we have is a first name, "Maura," and a general description.
We need to box McKeon in.
There's only one of two ways his semen ends up in that rape kit:
consensual sex or rape.
We get him to swear there was no consensual sex.
Why would he do that?
Because he has a wife.
There you are.
How you doing?
You nervous?
No, but maybe I should be.
This is just a pretrial hearing.
State's attorney's trying to squash our subpoena,
Today we just get the ground rules straight, in case this thing goes to trial.
Kalinda, I need you to get upstairs, get in the state's attorney's office and wait for the subpoena.
- I'll do that.
- What?
You don't have to.
- I know.
I'll be back.
- You all right?
Yeah, sure, I'm fine.
Oh, my God, this is too good.
We got Judge Abernathy.
He's our newest judge.
He's so liberal, he makes Michael Moore look like Rush Limbaugh.
Justice may be blind, but judges sure aren't.
God, Ericcson must be pulling his hair out.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Oh, please, don't stand.
Everybody sit back down, please.
We've got the big room here, don't we?
Your Honor, given the stature of my client, Mr. McKeon, and given the fact that this pretrial hearing has already garnered the attention of our friends in the press,
We would ask the court to seal the pretrial filings and avoid a show trial.
Mr. Ericcson, I don't think we need to do all that.
Do we?
First amendment issues and all?
I deny the petition with regret.
Mr. Gardner?
Yes, Your Honor.
We have a lot of testimony focusing on whether there was a consensual act between Mr. McKeon and my client, but if Mr. McKeon is willing to stipulate there was, indeed, a consensual sexual act, we would forego this testimony.
That's a good point.
Mr. Ericcson, how do you respond?
We will stipulate there was no sex of any kind, forced or consensual, Your Honor.
The plaintiff also requests an expedited trial date,
Your Honor, a DNA sample from Mr. McKeon,
DNA results from the rape kit, and the investigative reports from the state's attorney's office.
They have been reluctant to furnish them.
Thank you, counselor.
I will grant all four motions.
Mr. Ericcson?
Ah.
I interpret from Mr. Ericcson's, gesture that he acquiesces.
Well, I'll see you all back here...
Let's see.
My docket is clear.
Five days?
How's that for expedited?
As a side note, I would like to ask for a moment of silence for the recent mass killings in
Darfur.
Thank you.
Court adjourned.
That was a great start?
I understand you're having trouble with the driver.
You're boxed in on the rape kit.
You should just settle on our terms.
Yeah, right.
See you in trial.
May 15, four months ago.
- This one seemed cool.
- Hey.
So you know will?
12 clients, stockbroker types.
You two went to school together?
That's what they were saying the other night at drinks.
- Yeah.
- So that's why?
Cary, if you don't mind, I've had only a week with this.
You got an expedited trial date to force the other side to settle, and now you guys are the ones suffering.
- What are you looking for?
- "TZK Industries."
I...
I've seen it somewhere before.
What is TZK Industries?
"TZK Industries."
It's a furniture supply company.
"Supplying elegant furniture to home and business." Why?
What do you need?
Something to undercut Christy's driver.
It can't be that easy, can it?
What?
So I find this odd, Mr. Grant.
You were there, and you say there was no rape?
So either you're lying or my client's lying.
All I know is what I saw.
Your Honor, request permission to approach the witness.
Yes.
Please.
Approach.
Mr. Grant, this is a copy of your wife's w-2.
Could you read the name of your wife's employer, please?
"TZK Industries."
And TZK Industries is a company owned by the McKeon family to supply furniture to their properties.
- Objection.
Not in evidence.
- I think it's all right for it to be asked,
Mr. Ericcson.
I... actually, sustained.
- Your Honor, you sustained the objection?
- I did.
Mr. Ericcson had a point.
Isn't it an amazing coincidence, Mr. Grant, that after a year of unemployment, your wife got a job in June from the McKeon family, a month after the bachelor party incident?
And why is that, Mr. Grant?
Because my wife and I are divorced.
My wife and I have been separated for a year now, so her getting this job has nothing to do with me.
But, sir, wouldn't you benefit even if only in the form of lowered spousal support?
I guess, but I'm not Warren Buffett.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm sorry.
I didn't see it.
Don't ever let your first chair get undercut like that again.
Good news?
I just got the rape kit results.
State's attorney wasn't stonewalling.
They sent it out to a commercial lab and just got it back.
It's not McKeon's DNA.
The rape kit came back.
It's not his sperm.
It's not McKeon's DNA.
Grant says you're lying.
McKeon says you're lying.
I'm not lying.
I...
It's really not his sperm?
We need to get the full who else did you have sex with that night?
No one.
I swear.
You obviously had sex with someone because it isn't his sperm.
So, was it a boyfriend or another client?
- You need to find Maura.
- We can't find Maura.
You really don't remember anything to help us find her?
We can't find Maura.
We didn't talk.
She was on her cell phone the whole night till her battery ran out.
I'm sorry.
I need to get to class.
Not that I mind it, but since when did you become me?
- You didn't believe her.
I did.
- Maybe she is telling the truth.
Christy said the light was flicked out, so maybe McKeon was with a friend.
Let's see if the cops tested the other party-goers.
Worth a try.
It's not just that.
What's up with your bud, Abernathy?
He's going out of his way to kill us.
You know how this works.
Liberal judge gets on the bench, doesn't want to rule from his bias, he bends over backwards the other way.
I thought you said you had some pull with him.
He wanted to be on your glass ceiling committee or whatever it is "Emily's list".
Are you suggesting I influence a sitting judge
- in some untoward fashion?
- No, just in a toward one.
Come on, come to the court, let him see your sad little liberal face... and contemplate a life without his friends.
Will, I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
We're a team.
No apologies.
- Now what are you doing?
- Close the door.
- Come on, Zach.
Just let it go.
- Would you shut up and look at this?
See that?
It's called a "specular highlight." It's like a light in the eye reflected in the eye.
See where it is?
It's to the left.
And now, look at this.
The lady's eye.
See?
The dot's to the right.
Okay... they're not in the same picture.
Dad's face was photoshopped into it.
Hello?
Zach, Grace, I'm home.
Jackie, I have a request to make.
Certainly, dear.
You want the kids to visit Peter in prison, you talk to me.
- You don't talk to Zach.
- When did I talk to Zach?
- You told him Peter was lonely in prison.
- Because he is.
Just don't go around me by talking to my kids.
Hey, mom.
Hey.
- How was work?
- It was crappy.
- I thought I'd make breakfast.
- For dinner?
- My goodness.
- Like when you were little.
You don't have to like it.
It's for me.
I want to show you some pictures of where dad's staying.
What?
I want to make sure you know what's involved with visiting dad in prison?
I'll get that.
Zach, can you show me how to get to "google images" on your computer?
Yeah, sure.
What is that?
Nothing.
Homework.
Mom!
Someone's here!
Hi.
Still no Maura?
DNA is definitely not from McKeon's semen.
I was going to the crime lab to see if they ever collected DNA from the other party-goers when...
You can watch a little tv.
I'll be right in.
- Want to do this later?
- No, no, no.
I think I just caught my son checking out porn.
Anyway...
I asked a cop friend to run the rape kit results through codis.
And they got a hit.
Who, the best man?
Manny Lyons.
A rapist serving 20 to life in an Ohio supermax.
- I don't understand.
- You're in good company.
And he's a convicted rapist.
- Christy was raped.
- Apparently.
I don't get it.
Was he... was he at the party?
As far as I can tell, he was in a holding cell in Columbus at the time.
- This makes no sense.
- We know.
This pile is everything on the Manny Lyons rape.
This pile, everything on ours.
And we can't find one thing in common.
No connection with McKeon?
Nope, we checked it.
"Manny Lyons broke into an Upper Arlington apartment, held a knife to the neck of a 40-year-old divorcee, raped her, and stole her car.
He was stopped running a traffic light ten miles away.
The divorcee identified him in a six-pack photo line-up."
What?
They do have one thing in common.
And you were the lab supervisor who worked on analysis 5795 the rape kit in this case...
professor?
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
And these are your initials,
"gg" right at the bottom of the report?
Yes, those are mine.
Excuse me.
This isn't 5795.
Yes, this is 5794.
The Manny Lyons case.
My mistake.
I see that you ran the analysis on both cases.
Given the sequential numbering,
I imagine that you worked on one right after the other?
It appears so.
In both cases, the DNA matched the same culprit,
Manny Lyons, is that correct?
It is.
So let... let me follow the logic here.
Manny Lyons...
- who never set foot in Chicago...
- Objection.
Not in evidence.
I will sustain that.
Isn't it true, Dr. Girtzman, the only connection between Manny Lyons and Christy barbosa is that you worked on both cases?
Objection.
Argumentative.
Mrs. Florrick, this is not a debating society.
Sustained.
Dr. Girtzman, would you say that the standard of a commercial lab is relaxed?
No.
Your Honor, may I answer her earlier question?
- Personal privilege.
- Oh, yeah, if you'd like.
We handle an immense backlog of untested rape kits from crime labs all across the country.
We do so with speed and professionalism...
And yet isn't it true, that your lab almost lost its accreditation in 2005...
- That was never proved!
- When it cross-contaminated two DNA samples that were out-sourced
- from a crime lab.
- This is an old slander!
That you failed to sterilize scissors that then carried the DNA
- from one sample to the next?
- I don't have to answer this.
Actually, you do, sir.
Your Honor, given this testimony, we move that the rape kit be reexamined at a second genetic lab.
I think that is an understandable request, Mr. Ericcson.
Your Honor, we would stipulate that Mrs. Florrick has proven her case.
Dr. Girtzman cross-contaminated the sample...
But we would argue, therefore, that is the very reason it cannot be tested again.
- You've got to be kidding me.
- The very fact that it is agreed that the sample is now contaminated means it can't possibly
- be tested with any authority.
- Your Honor...
Mr. Gardner, you argued that the rape kit was contaminated.
You can't now argue it's probative.
The plaintiff's motion for retesting is denied.
- Your Honor...
- Motion is denied.
We've got to find that other stripper.
So basically this is a hail mary pass?
Look at you with the sports metaphors.
Yeah, I don't see many other options here.
Good evening.
- Do you have a reservation?
- Actually, we have a... strange request.
We need to get a printout of a phone bill from four months ago.
- The name?
- McKeon.
- First name?
- Lloyd.
Would you liked that e-mailed or a hard copy?
Hard copy.
If I could just see some I.D., Mr. McKeon.
Actually can I ask you a question...
Rosemary?
There was a bachelor party here in May that resulted in a... a rape.
Were you here then?
I was.
Well, the only person we believe who can corroborate the rape victim's story was using a cell phone that night.
And we're thinking she used the bathroom phone when her battery ran out.
We were hoping to glance at the bill just to see if there was a number she dialed.
I'll have to speak to a manager.
Nice thought.
If all else fails, try honesty.
I got 20 bucks on deception.
Will?
Oh, hey.
What are you doing north of the loop?
You know, just seeing how the other half lives.
Alicia, this is Marlena.
Nice to meet you.
Ask for a view of the lake.
It's beautiful at night.
She thinks we're getting a room.
Yep.
Now they all think we're getting a room.
- You worried?
- You?
We could do worse.
I'm having trouble getting my manager.
If you could just wait another minute.
I owe you $20.
Christy and Maura arrived at 10:15.
Right there, 11:20.
Out-of-state area code.
Hello.
You don't know me...
Were you the other dancer there that night, Maura?
I was, yes.
And your driver, Mr. Grant, what did he tell you after you took Christy to the hospital?
He told us that the McKeons were very rich, and we should all keep our mouths shut.
And that's why you went back home to Michigan?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I was scared.
And to reiterate,
Christy told you about the rape immediately afterward?
Yes.
In fact, he... followed her out intoarking lot and he said, "don't tell anyone.
Just take the money and shut up."
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Alicia.
For... you know.
Christy, I'm just curious.
Where did you meet my husband?
Your husband?
I've never met your husband.
My mistake.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Good afternoon.
I have given this case quite a bit of thought, as you can imagine.
You have both argued your case well.
But I find myself judging in favor of the defendant.
Without a DNA match to the rape kit, we have a classic he-said, she-said; and as much as my personal sympathies lie with the plaintiff, the evidence does not warrant a favorable decision.
Judgment in favor of the defense.
Are you okay?
No.
I'm sorry.
I believe you.
This is all I want to say.
I have been falsely accused by a woman who wanted nothing more than a quick payday.
But every year there are thousands of women who are abused, and I don't think we should let this false accusation...
Mr. McKeon.
You're under arrest for the rape of Christy Barbosa.
- Cuff him.
- What?
Is this a joke?
It must be hard to lose, Mrs. Florrick.
Not if it forces you to prosecute.
I'm coming out of this with a criminal case I'll win, and you're coming out with a loss.
Nice job.
Lloyd McKeon was arrested today for rape, literally seconds after he was cleared in a civil case for the identical crime.
State's attorney Glenn Childs took credit for finding an untainted sample of DNA that will guarantee McKeon's conviction in a criminal trial.
Childs denied that McKeon's arrest was a reaction to.
This is yours?
Yeah.
Is he going to jail?
I think so.
Well, then that's good.
Thanks.
- Good night.
- Good night.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to beg.
- Please... oh...
- Does she do this for you?
- Does she?
- Oh, God, please...
You're amazing...
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do to you?
Just... don't... stop.
What'll you give me?
What'll you give me not to stop?
Everything.
Good job, Alicia.
WILL:
Thanks for going all out this year.
It's been quite a ride.
DIANE:
And we're not out of the woods yet.
We have a lot of trimming to do.
So we're all going to have to work harder.
WILL:
Do more with less.
I'm ready.
DIANE:
We know you are.
You okay?
Yes.
Don't worry, everything's going to be fine.
Cary, do you have a minute?
Yes.
You're safe.
I'm safe?
Pink slips are going out.
There's gonna be a lot of blood in these halls in about an hour.
They fired him.
They kept you?
I got a client last minute through Peter.
Smart.
No.
You got a client.
Cary would have done the same thing if he had that opportunity.
Kalinda, don't.
Do you have your keys?
My...?
Your car keys.
Do you have them?
Why?
I just want to compare them.
Are you trying to distract me?
Yeah.
Uh, Kalinda?
What are you doing?
You won, he lost.
So you're going to turn this into some morbid thing because that's who you are.
So, let's go.
Let me get my bag.
(loud music plays) KALINDA:
It's a Lockhart/Gardner tradition.
Now you're an associate- two shots of tequila.
âª Yo!
You see me burnin' up âª âª Body hot to the touch, come on!
âª âª Partying at the club âª âª Yo, deejay, turn it up... âª
(sighs)
Oh.
I have to be home by 8:00.
Let me see your phone.
No, Kalinda, really, I have to get home.
Alicia, I'm taking responsibility for your irresponsibility.
Let me see your phone.
âª...at every occasion, big boy ain't a star âª âª I'm a constellation âª Hmm... âª Keep your hands up, that's my occupation, so I just need... âª
Hi.
Uh, who am I speaking to?
Zach.
This is Kalinda.
Sure.
One second.
Hey, Dad, Mom's going to be working late again tonight.
(doorbell ringing)
Tell her not to worry.
Okay.
Yeah, that's fine.
Thanks.
You don't look like a man who's going to be free in a few days.
There's been a hitch.
Hmm?
Look, I really miss Daniel Golden.
Well, when the Obama White House calls, you got to go.
Golden said she's the better litigator.
(computer chirping) It's just easy to underestimate her.
Well, she must be very, very good, because I'm greatly underestimating her.
(computer chirps) (grunts)
Ms. Tascioni, hi.
Eli Gold.
Oh, yes.
Hello.
You're not good with computers, are you?
My son keeps buying me new ones and then just backing away- and laughing.
(chuckles)
So what are we watching?
Evidence.
For the retrial?
Yep.
(computer chirps)
But the prosecution lost its only witness, right?
Kozko committed suicide, so they don't have a case.
And I thought Monday would be a simple matter of a dismissal, but watch.
(computer chirps)
(groans)
(computer chirps)
(computer beeps) GLENN:
Prosecution interview B-3:
People v. Peter Florrick.
Peter was pretty bald about it.
Uh, $45,000 would buy you a certain amount of access.
$85,000- more.
GLENN:
Did he say what he needed the money for?
KOZKO:
A down payment on a bigger house.
This is a video proffer completed by Mr. Kozko before his death.
The prosecution now plans to introduce it into evidence.
But they can't, because it's hearsay.
That's right.
And they don't want to use it.
They want the press to use it.
Well, that was my first guess, but these aren't the motions of a prosecution winding down.
KOZKO:
Peter promised me an ear, and he also promised me his friendship.
(dance music plays)
MAN:
Come on, everybody, join the happy couple on the dance floor.
Let go...
No.
(both laughing)
You know, Will feels the same way about you.
No, he doesn't.
And even if he did, it doesn't matter.
It does.
I phone Will, I tell him we're in a bar and that you're too drunk to go home.
So you're getting a hotel room upstairs.
Alicia, one night- no repercussions.
And tomorrow?
Tomorrow you wake up.
(chuckles)
That's just not me, Kalinda.
Everything is you.
Everything you want to be you is you.
You two are so hot.
(both laughing)
And, um...
You-you are?
Brian.
I'm the best man.
What are you celebrating?
Tomorrow her husband is being freed from house arrest.
Really?
All right, uh, well, I'm getting you both drinks.
Yeah.
(snickering)
Are you gay?
Oh, come on.
We are talking about every single little detail of my life.
It's a simple question.
I'm...
I'm private.
Ugh.
Come on.
What does it matter?
It doesn't.
Then why'd you want to know?
Because I do.
And how is this fair?
I talk about everything.
I didn't say it was.
You like to talk about your life.
I don't like to talk about mine.
(cell phone ringing)
What?
Nothing.
It's work.
Hi.
It's me.
Yes.
I know.
Hi.
How you doing?
Good, actually.
Really good.
I'm glad.
You deserve it.
Um, how about you?
Well, we're in the midst of layoffs.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
No, no.
It just has to be done.
Alicia, I...
You...?
I, um...
Can I ask you a favor?
I just got a call from a client who needs help, but I can't get away right now.
Oh, um, yeah, of course.
Which client?
Colin Sweeney.
I know.
Look, it'll be easy.
We just revamp the language on his company merger.
I'm sure he just wants to ask a few questions before he signs.
I was gonna send Brad, but we just let him go.
Oh, God.
No, of course.
Um, it's-it's close to here.
Thanks.
Don't leave without a fully-executed copy, okay?
This merger is very important to the firm.
(sighs)
Thanks.
I'm really glad this worked out.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Bye.
Just give me a minute.
(doorbell chimes)
SWEENEY (over intercom):
Yes.
Who's there?
Mr. Sweeney, it's Alicia Florrick.
Will Gardner sent me.
Uh... (laughs)
Uh, sure, come on up.
(buzzer sounds)
(door bangs shut)
Mr. Sweeney?
Mr. Sweeney?
SWEENEY:
Uh, in the study.
Uh, could you grab the camera on the table, please, dear?
I have a cab waiting, Mr. Sweeney.
Will Gardner said you'd have a... red-lined contract waiting for me.
I can explain.
SWEENEY:
This...
This is not what it looks like.
Oh, oh, yeah, the camera.
Yes.
Um, I...
Could you?
I can't reach.
I already phoned 911 a minute ago.
Is she dead?
Sheila?
Yeah.
It was self-defense.
You have to believe that.
She attacked me.
Uh, sorry.
I just...
Mr. Sweeney, stop!
Kalinda, there's been...
I need your help at Colin Sweeney's.
There's been a murder.
No.
I don't know.
Um, I didn't know it was a crime scene, and my fingerprints are on...
Mr. Sweeney, don't!
They were just so embarrassing.
The pictures.
Put the camera down.
As soon as you can.
Thanks.
Don't move!
(clattering)
Hello?
What's wrong?
Is someone else here?
No.
Why?
(distant siren wailing) SWEENEY:
Here comes the cavalry!
(siren approaching)
He never hurt anyone.
Chili- he barely even barked.
So you're saying she killed your dog?
Even though the victim has no defensive wounds on her body from a canine attack.
Mr. Sweeney is choosing not to answer at this time, Detective.
Mrs. Florrick, you said that your fingerprints were on, uh...
On the doorbell, on the entering doorknob, on the banister...
On the camera.
He opened the back of the camera?
I can't answer that, due to attorney-client privilege.
But your fingerprints are on the camera?
Yes, as I said.
So you're still insisting that you didn't tamper with evidence?
Yes.
Even though
I smell alcohol on your breath?
Tony...
This is my job, Ms. Sharma.
I don't interfere with your job.
We were celebrating when I received a phone call from Mr. Sweeney.
Excuse me.
From Mr. Gardner... a partner at my firm.
He told me to come here to collect contracts.
I arrived by cab.
I did not drive myself.
You're under arrest for murder, Mr. Sweeney.
Back in the cuffs I go.
Listen to me, Mr. Sweeney.
Remain silent.
Irony does not work here.
Jokes don't work.
Do you understand?
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
BAILIFF:
All rise!
The Honorable Graham Schickel presiding.
SCHICKEL:
Good morning.
As the youngest justice on the bench in the state of Illinois,
I would like to say welcome.
And I believe you have a motion, Mr. State's Attorney?
I do, Your Honor.
We move to introduce into evidence the video proffer made by our key witness Gerald Kozco, recently deceased.
Yes, Your Honor.
Hi.
Um, I hate to object right off the bat here, but, uh, the key word here is "deceased"
Mr. Florrick has a right to challenge his accuser.
I can't cross-examine a dead witness, as much as I'd like to try.
GLENN:
Uh, your Honor, two years ago,
Illinois legislature, in a 109-to-0 vote, passed the Peterson Law, which makes us the only state in the union which allows hearsay evidence- such as this proffer- when the accused benefits from the death.
Ah, getting novel on us, Mr. Childs.
This law is almost as new as I am.
(chuckles) Yes, Your Honor, but unfortunately for Mr. Childs, the Peterson Law requires the accused benefit not just from a death, but from a murder he committed.
And Mr. Kozco committed suicide.
The police have not made that determination, Your Honor.
No body has been found yet, and we will present evidence to the contrary.
(laughs)
My apologies, Your Honor.
I'm sorry.
I found that humorous.
Mr. Childs would like to prove my client is a murderer, so he can prosecute him for corruption?
Well, that is certainly novel.
Well, novel or not, we will hear evidence on this alleged murder tomorrow.
(gavel raps)
(indistinct conversation)
Guys in the Bureau might want to keep track of Mr. Florrick...
Yes, he's talking wi t the Feds.
I think things just got more serious.
Coordinating strategy?
I don't know.
(Glenn speaking indistinctly)
Hi.
Are you two coordinating strategy?
Mr. Childs and I are old friends.
(sighs) What a relief.
SWEENEY:
She would ambush me.
I'd fight.
And if I won, we'd have sex.
DIANE:
She was your stalker, but you encouraged her?
It was a game.
She'd break in, I would disarm her, we'd have sex.
It was terrific.
This time, it was different.
This time, she tried to kill me.
The police are calling the victim a Jane Doe.
Do you have any idea who she was?
No.
I just knew her as Sheila Penn.
You said she wrote you?
Yes, classic stalker letters.
Where are they?
In his bedside table, which means the police already have it.
Let's petition the court for access to these letters.
When do we get forensics, blood work?
ALICIA:
Preliminary, three days.
We should get an expedited necropsy on the dog.
I think that's a cul-de-sac.
Preliminary M.E. report shows no defensive wounds on the victim from a canine attack.
Yes, but Sweeney said he heard no barking at all when the Jane Doe broke in.
So maybe the attacker sedated the dog first.
That would show up in a necropsy.
And if we can prove
Jane Doe sedated the dog, it's premeditation;
she went there with the purpose of doing harm.
Good, it's a place to start.
Get the letters and get the dog.
Alicia, do you have a second?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I thought it was contracts.
I never would've sent you there.
Will, really, it's fine.
How are you handling it?
The body, the blood.
Oh.
Good.
I didn't really think about it.
(laughs)
What a weird life we lead, huh?
So, are we normal again, are we dealing with it?
We talking about the crime scene now?
No.
Yes, we're dealing with it.
Well, welcome back.
Talk about the luck of Job.
On the brink of merging Sweeney's company with another one, this happens.
The merger's not off-track yet.
I'm phoning to check everybody's temperature.
The CEO was just accused of murder.
Everybody'll scramble.
Not necessarily.
The buyer's motivated, and money is money.
What's that about?
Oh, the layoffs.
Yes.
Won't be a fun day.
Cary...
I'm just getting my laptop.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Sorry you got the job, or sorry for what you did to get the job?
Sorry we both didn't get the job.
Alicia, here's the thing...
You like to think you're a good person, and maybe at one time you were, but we both know you'll do whatever it takes.
Sleeping with the boss?
Check.
Cary, if it makes you feel better to think that, then think it, but...
I don't have a name,
Alicia, I don't have a fairy godmother I can phone up or the whole Chicago political machine.
I had to work, I had to sweat, I had to make money for this firm, and that's just not enough.
Sir, you have to leave.
I need my laptop and my personal items.
You can itemize them, and they will be collected and sent to your home.
I need them now.
That's not possible, sir.
They'll be returned to you within three working days.
(quietly):
This was not fair.
And I was stupid- I acted like it would be.
ALICIA:
So, these letters were sent to Sweeney?
KALINDA:
Yeah.
Sweeney's at least telling the truth about being stalked.
"You're dead meat, my darling.
I feast on dead meat."
Is she still a Jane Doe?
Yep.
What?
You know what's odd?
These letters are filled with details from his trial.
ALICIA:
A juror?
KALINDA:
It's the legal language she uses.
"I want to kill that idiot deponent."
"I hate the Rule 30 slut."
It's like someone in the business.
KALINDA:
These are from the first trial.
Who's this?
Court reporter.
Yeah.
That could be her.
Yeah.
What's her name?
Burton, get ready to write down an address.
Not to sound too melodramatic, Your Honor, but objection.
Really.
Your Honor, Mrs. Kozko heard directly from her husband that if he were to die under mysterious circumstances that it would be at Peter Florrick's hand.
Yes, and I heard from a butterfly it wouldn't be.
Both are hearsay statements,
Your Honor, and equally inadmissible.
The Peterson Law allows for exactly such hearsay testimony.
So let me get this straight- it allows for hearsay as long as a murder is established.
And a muerer is established here because there's a hearsay statement that establishes it- I mean, tell me when the snake actually devours its tail, okay?
Ms. Tascioni, you're ridiculing established Illinois law.
Yes, Your Honor, gleefully.
Well, I know I'm the, uh, youngest judge on the bench, but...
Yes, Your Honor, we're all in awe.
...but I will overrule your objection.
Given the Peterson Law, this testimony is allowed.
If you have a problem with that, you can take it up with the Supreme Court.
Okay.
Now I get to work.
Hybristophiliac.
Women who are irresistibly attracted to dangerous men.
It's quite common.
Women who propose to Charlie Manson or send their panties to Jeffrey Dahmer.
45 years.
No.
See you in court.
Fine.
This isn't gangbanger number five, Ms. Lockhart;
this is Colin Sweeney.
People want him behind bars.
Then people should find better evidence, because this screams self-defense, ma'am.
The thing is... these letters didn't just go one way.
How's Peter doing?
Fine... thank you.
JULIUS:
Where'd you get these?
The victim's house.
You see, Mr. Sweeney wrote back, encouraging her, taunting her.
I'm sure you can find a psychological term for that, too.
Hysterical prosecution?
45 years.
Here is a copy of the victim's diary with some very interesting entries on your client, and some quite specific descriptions of their sexual practices.
So, this is you?
This is me?
Milking it?
The wife of Peter Florrick representing a killer.
Interesting.
I hadn't considered that.
Well, what about this?
The state's attorney hired a sick, killer-obsessed court reporter for some of the state's most high-profile criminal cases.
Now that will be a fun lawsuit.
Well, you got me there, Mrs. Florrick.
So, let's try this.
Why don't we both just do our jobs?
(scoffs) Of course I wrote back.
I love a good fetish.
Cut the crap, Mr. Sweeney.
You're looking at 45 years.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Please take a look at the diary, Mr. Sweeney.
(sighs)
Sheila...
Warburg?
My God, how prosaic.
Sweaty suburban sex with Sheila Warburg.
JULIUS:
We need to figure out what's true and what she made up.
Well, this is not true.
This one here.
I'm not opposed to it in principle.
(laughing):
But my goodness.
DIANE:
If you could underline the parts that are fiction?
Certainly.
Look...
I had sex with her twice.
She liked to pretend to break in and handcuff me.
We would wrestle, then we'd have sex.
But this time, she wouldn't stop.
I tried to get her to drop the knife, but...
Then we-we struggled, anand-and the knife it went in.
That's it.
Okay, we'll get back to you.
Right.
I have to go.
Give me a few hours.
(sighs)
Julius!
The merger's on.
If anything, Mr. Sweeney's troubles have shored up the buyer's interest.
They were scared of his volatility.
Meaning?
Well, we're not changing our defense strategy, but...
It would benefit us if Mr. Sweeney took a plea?
Okay, we can't say that, but I'backing away from Mr. Sweeney's defense.
A Chinese Wall.
You and Alicia continue, and we'll say no more.
Make any deal you can, defend him any way you can.
We won't talk to you, you won't talk to us.
Okay?
Got it.
(door opens and closes)
Are you dancing a jig inside?
Like Rose on the Titanic.
(laughs)
(sighs)
MAN:
Cary Agos!
Marty.
You work here?
Uh, no.
Trying to.
I thought you were at Lockhart/Gardner.
Yeah.
I was.
Layoffs.
Oh, my God.
Same at Orren Polk.
And I wouldn't even go in here.
They're just lining up resumes for 2011.
Come on, let's go get a drink.
Ah, maybe I'll give it a try.
You don't believe me?
Well, go for it.
Hey, did you hear about Corsican?
Harvard Review, clerked for Scalia.
Now he's writing a screenplay.
About what?
(laughs):
Who cares?
Hey, so, if you change your mind, some of the old buds are getting together at Brandos, all right?
Drop by.
Okay, get them to his desk today, and I will meet you there.
The FBI doesn't give you much space, does it?
This is the size of my old college dorm room.
Were you visiting someone else in the building, Mr. Gold?
I was, but I thought I'd make a little detour.
I can't talk about any ongoing investigations.
Oh, I didn't think you could.
I thought I'd lklk about 'em.
Oh, knock yourself out.
Glenn Childs has it out for my client.
It is a politically-motivated prosecution, and the FBI should not be in the business of taking sides.
You are reading too much into my visit with Mr. Childs.
He is giving you evidence against Florrick.
He is suggesting that Florrick is responsible for Kozko's death.
And you're buying it.
Well, you know your secret investigation of my client- it's no longer a secret.
I've seen this.
I know you have, but you haven't seent.t... on the side of a bus.
And I had it made into buttons.
One for each of the reporters visiting the court.
And... coffee mugs.
And this is a little mouse pad, just for you.
You think this will scare us, Mr. Gold?
The office that took down Capone?
Really?
Oh, I know how the FBI works... ma'am.
You don't like to hunt for new game.
You'd rather take down an already bleeding deer, because you want to look good for your superiors.
Well, this is just to say that we are not bleeding.
We have a lot of fight left in us yet.
So go find some new game.
KALINDA:
We need to talk.
That doesn't sound good.
It's Sweeney.
When is it ever good?
I got the results of the dog necropsy.
No drugs in Chili?
That's not all.
There was blood on the dog's fur from the victim.
Makes sense.
Blood when she broke in.
No, she didn't cut herself from breaking in.
It's from the struggle.
It...
It can't be.
She wasn't alive after the struggle.
Right.
And there was also blood from Sweeney.
And these.
Hesitation knife wounds, with a tentative angling of the knife.
Someone hesitated before they killed the dog?
Yep.
The dog's owner?
Hardest thing I've ever done.
He was so innocent.
You did it?
You actually killed your dog?
(sniffling
Who was going to believe me?
Not a soul.
You don't.
I panicked.
I
- I thought if the police saw she killed my dog, they'd see...
JULIUS:
Mr. Sweeney, we're gonna have to talk about taking a plea.
Maybe we can talk them down to 30 years.
(scoffs)
I didn't do this.
ALICIA:
Just stop it.
Mr. Sweeney, stop it.
You killed your dog.
Yeah, but this lady tried to kill me.
I was protecting myself.
Oh, my God.
JULIUS:
We'll try to make the best deal we can, Mr. Sweeney.
MARTY:
You used to drop the H-bomb, people would look up, put your resume on the top.
Now everybody's, "Ah, so what?
Harvard grad"
Hey, look- Justice Hart.
MARTY:
No, he's already staffed up.
CARY:
So you guys just drink here, trying to get a job?
You make it sound so sad.
Yeah.
We're absorbing legal culture.
Thanks, guys.
Glenn Childs, six o'clock.
MARTY:
HuHuh.
Righ.
When I want to make a first-year teacher's salary.
Well, they're not hiring, anyway.
So, Cary, you're the last one working.
What's your severance?
My severance?
I don't know.
Oh, you'll find out.
Last one working pays.
All right.
(slow jazz playing)
Have you read Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell?
Excuse me?
The book.
Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.
Okay.
It says The Beatles are The Beatles because they played 10,000 hours in a German strip club.
Bill Gates is Bill Gates because he worked 10,000 hours in an after-school computer lab.
What do you want, Mr. Childs?
To ge e you the chance to work 10,000 hours prosecuting the worst scum in Chicago.
I know who you are, Cary.
I know you're responsible for some of our worst defeats.
And I also know that you were underappreciated and undervalued at Lockhart/Gardner.
I want you to join us, I want you to...
Yes.
I'll need your help with Alicia Florrick.
She and her husband...
Yes.
Good.
See you tomorrow.
Thanks.
Here we go.
I think I hold control, shift and D.
(computer chimes) No.
F.
No.
Actually, Ms. Tascioni, I
- I am a little busy.
I have a client.
Yes, the problem is,
I lack confidence with computers.
Can we... do this another time?
Did you know Mrs. Kozko has three children?
Anthony, Lisa and Arthur.
I didn't.
Anthony is the oldest, Lisa's the middle child, and... (computer chimes) Darn!
Control, C?
(computer chimes) Arthur is the youngest?
Yes.
Arthur is the youngest.
Well, Mr. and Mrs. Kozko placed $45,000 in all of their accounts for college.
(whispers):
Mr. Gold?
Very nice gesture.
Okay.
And this money was not to be touched until they graduated from high school.
Well, Anthony already graduated from college, so he spent his.
And Lisa is in college now, so she's halfway through her spending.
And Arthur...
Arthur didn't start spending his college money until this year.
Two weeks ago, to be specific.
Okay.
Well, the funny thing is, Arthur isn't in college.
In fact, Arthur was a stillborn birth in 1992.
Now, that is funny.
Yes.
And that got me thinking- who is withdrawing all this money from his bank account?
And where is it withdrawn?
Funny you should ask.
STL Bank and Trust in Savannah.
Georgia?
No.
Did you know there's another Savannah, in the Cayman Islands?
I did not know that.
It's interesting, isn't it?
So how are you ahead of the police on this?
They're not looking.
You seem tbebe down one partner today.
And I'm wearing a different tie.
What's that matter?
We want involuntary manslaughter, five years.
With for-day time off?
That's three years for a brutal sexual homicide.
Second degree, 15 years, and we're putting a 24-hour clock on it.
Offer exreres tomorrow.
We have proof that Sweeney was stalked.
Can we at least stipulate the victim stalked him?
Agreed, he was stalked.
So?
ALICIA:
There are stalker statutes on the books- statutes that my husband instituted when he was in office.
statutes tAnd your point, Mrs. Florrick?
Talk to your boss.
What sort of message would he be sending to stalking victims if Sweeney's prosecuted?
Are you really trying a blame-the-victim defense with Colin Sweeney?
Offer him ten years, and we don't have to go to trial.
Then let me talk to my boss.
(clears throat)
Where is Diane?
Chinese Wall.
Criminal and acquisitions.
The merger?
Yes.
It's my guess, it's probably more lucrati if Sweeney's out of the picture.
If Sweeney takes a plea, he can be removed as CEO.
Does Sweeney know about this?
He knows that we represent his criminal and financial interests.
Yes.
Feighen Ladsloe.
The murderer?
Mm-hmm.
On death row.
Sheila corresponded with him.
Before Sweeney?
You know, I thought I recognized those entries in her diary.
The ones Sweeney said were fiction- they were from Feighen's trial.
The court reporter?
Yeah.
I'm checking all of her trials now, see what other killers she corrpoponded with.
Where you going?
To tell Julius.
This could get them down from ten years.
Hey.
Hey.
How's that Chinese Wall?
s.s. Florrick, as much I like keeping our working relationship collegial, don't forget, you're a junior associate, and I'm an equity partner.
Watch your tone.
Yes, sir.
I will.
I think we should reconsider the plea bargain.
Kalinda's found new evidence.
What evidence?
Sheila Warburg- she stalked other killers.
So you think he's innocent?
No.
I think he's innocent of this.
SCHICKEL:
I am ready to hear Mrs. Kozko's testimony, Ms. Tascioni.
Yes, just one last objection, Your Honor.
The Peterson Law- as atrocious as it may be...
Objection.
Sustained.
It requires that Mr. Florrick not only profit from a murder, but be the instrument of that murder, correct?
Are you asking me, Ms. Tascioni?
Um, no, but you can answer if you want to.
And you can get to the point.
Oh, okay.
Well, for Mr. Kozko to be murdered, one key thing is required that we overlooked.
And what is that, Ms. Tascioni?
That he be dead.
(gallery murmuring)
I did it.
Um, this is an ATM photo taken a week ago at BCP Bank and Trust in Savannah, Cayman Islands.
Your Honor, Mrs. Kozko's hearsay testimony is inadmissible, and Mr. Kozko's video proffer is likewise inadmissible for the very simple reason that Mr. Kozko is still alive.
(gallery murmuring) (gavel raps)
SCHICKEL:
Quiet.
Quiet, please.
It's done.
You're free.
(laughs)
Kalinda.
Hi.
Hey.
So, your boy is free.
My boy?
Florrick.
He just won.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
So I hear there are some tapes.
Oh, there are always some tapes.
And I hear that they hurt Childs and Florrick, so neither wanted to use them.
Mutually Assured Destruction.
Sounds like a fairy tale.
Funny how fairy tales turn out to be true.
Here's the thing, Kalinda.
This isn't about Childs or Florrick.
This is about Childs and Florrick.
We're investigating them both, and
I just don't want you to get hurt.
Thank you for your concern.
Hey.
I'm your friend here.
It's good to know.
So you would advise me to take this?
It's the best deal we could have made.
Eight years, and this is after we started with what I would have said was a...
an adamant 45.
SWEENEY:
Mrs. Florrick?
It's true.
They started with 45 years.
And why not court?
JULIUS:
Well, it's coming down to perceptions, Mr. Sweeney.
We would have filed for a change of venue, but...
I'm famous everywhere?
Yes.
(cell lock buzzes in distance)
They like me here.
In prison.
I'm like the king of kings.
It's not unlike getting the best table at Schwa, actually.
Same jockeying for position.
We have until 6:00 to take the plea.
Okay, thank you, Julius.
I
- I-I need to talk to Mrs. Florrick for a second.
We're, uh, working together.
Yes, I understand.
I just have a piece of gossip I want to share, please.
(lock buzzes)
It's about the merger?
Yes.
The company means more with me out of the picture?
Yes.
And... can I get better than eight years?
No.
And if we go to trial?
I don't know.
Sheila Warburg has stalked other killers, but I don't know if that's enough to overcome your... your baggage.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's-that's what I thought.
Well...
I did kill my wife.
So I guess the universe is having its little joke at my expense.
You killed her?
(laughs)
(snorts)
Your face.
Thank you.
Thank you for being honest.
You're welcome.
Well... (sighs)
Off I go.
(door slams) âª You feelin' all right?
âª
(applause and cheering) âª I'm not feelin' too good, myself âª
âª Well, you feelin' all right?
âª âª I'm not feelin' too good, myself... âª
It's over, isn't it?
Looks like it.
(Peter laughing)
Zach's drinking champagne.
Zach?
It's soda.
Do you know all these people?
ALICIA:
Some.
Mike, hey!
So, what are we gonna do?
Well, clean up.
No, after that.
Oh.
I don't know.
What do you want to do?
Buy a big house?
Go to Europe?
âª I'm not feelin' too good, myself... âª
He couldn't have done it without you.
Oh, that's not true.
It is.
We women stay in the shadows, we smile, we comfort, we nurse, but we're always there.
You are a good woman, Alicia.
PETER:
Alicia?
He needs you.
Alicia?
I'm not the lawyer.
You need to speak to my wife.
Hon?
This is Michael from the AFL-CIO, and he's looking for a very good Chicago-based law firm.
Alicia works for Lockhart Gardner.
She's one of their best lawyers.
If I do say so myself.
So, why don't you two talk?
Hi.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of cook county.
Are you still involved with prostitutes, sir?
Thanks for playing the breadwinner for a while.
It's not gonna last forever.
I just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity.
Glad you could come aboard.
Not only are you coming back to the workplace fairly late, but you have some very prominent baggage.
But, hey, if she can do it, so can you.
Kalinda Sharma.
Oh, the investigator.
You're Peter Florrick's wife.
That's right.
Last time I was in court was 13 years ago.
Wow, I was 12.
State's attorney's here.
I'm glenn Childs.
Peter blames me for his downfall.
Don't make yourself collateral damage here.
The day you leaked that sex tape to the press and forced me to shield my children, that was the day I became collateral damage.
You've obviously never made a woman angry before.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of cook county.
but I do admit to a failure of judgment in my dealings with these women.
I've never abused my office for sexual favors.
Give us time to heal and rebuild their trust... trust...
Mom, breakfast.
Oh, hey, congratulations.
That's great.
Your husband's appeal... it looks like he could get out of prison any month now, huh?
Looks like it.
Early Show had a story on it.
Some good stuff on you, too.
Did you catch it?
No, missed it.
Yeah, I caught it online.
I can send you the link.
That's okay.
No, no, no, it's easy.
So litigation wants me on this new class action.
That's where I'm headed.
What about you?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, in here, I guess.
When did you say this was?
May 15, four months ago.
Do you have anything with the date?
A parking receipt.
Had you ever met Mr. McKeon before?
No.
I'd seen his family on the news.
I heard about their hotels and stuff, but that's about it.
Well, the problem here, Christy, is that any civil suit could be seen as... opportunistic.
Because of their money?
Yes.
I'm sorry, but I didn't choose my rapist.
This kid doesn't know what she's in for.
Taking on the McKeon family...
Alicia, if you don't mind, we just need to...
No, it's all right, stay.
I don't know about this.
It's a criminal case, not a civil one.
Except the new state's attorney rejected the charges.
Yeah, because it's got
Duke Lacrosse written all over it.
Oh, come on.
What come on?
Put your politics aside, Diane.
You're Glenn Childs, you get this dropped in your lap... a stripper at a bachelor party accusing the son of the most powerful family in Chicago of rape... and you don't think it's Duke Lacrosse II?
He's worried about the McKeon family money.
He's worried about their campaign contributions.
Well, I'm worried that we're overextended.
How many sheffrin-marks depos o we have left?
210.
210.
We need to keep our eye on the ball.
And Christy is just gonna look like she's trying to make some quick cash from the McKeon family.
Do you believe her?
I believe a lot of things
I can't prove.
All right, here's what I think.
I know the McKeon family lawyer.
Ericcson?
Right,
William Ericcson.
That's just what we need... two Wills.
The McKeons are gonna want to keep this out of the press, even if he didn't do it.
So my guess is they throw her some cash, maybe 50 grand or so to keep her quiet.
Hmm, yeah.
Mr. Ericcson, please.
Tell him it's the other Will.
I want you to be at this lunch.
Don't say anything.
Just listen and look serious.
I can do that.
How you holding up here?
I'm holding up.
Oh, yeah, how do you know her?
Who?
Christy.
I don't.
Then why did she ask for you to be on the case?
I don't know.
Ericcson here.
Will.
Will.
I think you know why I'm calling.
Two months ago, Peter Florrick was sentenced to ten years for bribery and corruption.
Today was the first step toward his release.
He was known in Chicago simply as "the Hammer."
He jailed cop-killers, ceos, corrupt politicians, until "the hammer" got hammered.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
Within weeks, Chicago's incorruptible state's attorney found himself with all the trappings of a modern American scandal:
A rival with an eye on his job, an embarrassed wife, a blushing call girl and an R-rated sex tape.
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God, please.
You are ama...
Hey, ever heard the whole thing?
No.
You're the only one who hasn't.
Everything I have on McKeon.
What?
!
I beat you three sets to two.
Oh, come on, you don't even believe that.
This is driving me crazy.
How do I know you?
Me?
Miner, Parsons Layton?
Alicia is actually our newest junior associate.
One month in.
Will Ericcson, Alicia Florrick.
Well, it is very nice to meet you,
Mrs. Florrick.
You, too.
I'm rooting for your husband.
I know he has a lot of enemies in this town, but I always root for the underdog.
Oh, just ignore him.
The only reason someone's forced out of public office in America these days is sex.
So let's talk about Lloyd McKeon.
It's so sad, really.
I remember when you had a respectable firm, Will.
One that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these.
And what charges might those be, Will?
I haven't said anything yet.
Do you think you're the first firm she's shopping this lawsuit to?
There's nothing there.
Even the state's attorney...
the new state's attorney... thinks there's nothing there.
And yet
I got you to a settlement lunch on a half hour's notice.
Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage?
You want to know what I would say?
I would.
I would say you're trying to change the subject from rape.
Well, I would agree that, as offensive and misguided as these charges are, the optics aren't exactly in our favor.
So we're willing to make an offer.
It's nonnegotiable.
You have till end of business day.
McKeon did it.
Under a hundred thou, I would've said no.
Over a hundred thou...
What about well over?
If you don't mind my asking, Ms. Barbosa, why did you request me?
I saw you on tv.
I thought you'd understand what it's like to be misunderstood.
Ladies.
Sorry about that.
McKeon's lawyers made a financial offer that Diane and I actually agree on.
A first.
It's a cash settlement.
$450,000.
You're kidding.
We don't have to go to court?
He just offered that?
You'll have to sign a standard confidentiality agreement.
Both parties free each other of liability and agree not to speak to anyone, including the press.
What?
It's standard in civil agreements.
I want everybody to know he settled.
Can't we tell the police?
Not if we sign a confidentiality agreement.
McKeon could withdraw the award and sue you for defamation.
What do you think?
I think under the cir...
I think you're looking for justice, Christy.
And sometimes justice comes in a form we don't expect.
If you take this money, the settlement will be known to the two people that matter most, you and him.
I'm sorry, no.
He'll know how much it costs to rape somebody and get away with it, that's all.
This is about him admitting that he did this to me.
She's right.
Okay, ericcson, how flexible are you on confidentiality?
Exclude new criminal discovery.
Oh, come on, this isn't...
You want to go to court, is that it?
Take it as far as pretrial?
He doesn't want to go to trial.
Look, Ericcson, you want to make McKeon the bachelor party rapist, be my...
That's how you want to play it?
We just turned down a half million bucks.
Feels good, doesn't it?
Looks like we got a case.
You have to size these things up pretty quickly.
12 clients, stockbroker types, no one out of control.
It was easy.
They paid $400 for a 90-minute, two-girl fantasy strip.
Two girl?
Who was the other girl?
Maura...
I...
I don't remember her last name.
That was the only time she worked.
Sorry.
She insists on being here during all this.
It's a nightmare.
And McKeon, how'd you meet him?
The groom?
Hmm.
He offered me another $100 for a private lap dance.
When I got in the bedroom, he locked the door.
Then he grabbed me.
I tried to get the mace from my bag, tried to shout.
Did you tell anyone afterwards?
Maura.
And our driver Grant.
He was the one who suggested she drive me to the hospital for the rape exam.
And the service, worldwide elite, how long did you work for them?
Two years.
And what else did you do there?
What do you mean?
I mean, what else did you do there?
For a year, I was an escort.
Didn't you think that might be important to tell us?
I haven't gone on a call in a year.
I was in an abusive relationship.
I needed the money to move out.
When I moved, I stopped working.
But still stripped.
So what's your point...
A call girl can't get raped?
Yeah, that's my point, thanks.
Look, she lied to us.
Why believe her now?
'Cause she walked away from half a million dollars.
And when did she ever lie to us?
You know, the more you bond with these clients, the less helpful you are.
Your stripper was hooking.
Why is she my stripper when she does something bad?
Okay, so the point is to prepare for trial so we don't actually have to go to trial.
Cary, right?
Yes, sir.
Nice suit.
I got a job for you.
I need you to take
Alicia's sheffrin-marks depos for the week.
All right, I'm on it.
This is settlement poker.
No one wants to go to trial, but the person who plays the better hand makes the better deal.
So get me some good cards.
So your first thought is to come to the state attorney's office?
I just need one thing.
And why do I help you, again?
Because you like me.
That still works with people?
Mm-hmm, like a charm.
You never should have quit this place.
I didn't quit.
I was fired.
Come on.
You ran a solid rape investigation.
You should be dying to slip us the witness interviews.
Leah,
Could you come outside for a second?
And you're telling me your husband had nothing to do with this?
Mr. Childs, my law firm is bringing on a civil action, that's all.
Designed to embarrass my office and make it look like I don't care about a rape victim.
A happy coincidence?
I understand the need to blame someone for your husband's downfall, but I didn't release that sex tape to hurt you or your family.
I have kids, too.
And you should know I was holding back.
I had more to release about your husband, a lot more.
Disturbing things, but out of compassion, I held back.
Mr. Childs, if you have something to show me, just do it, okay?
'Cause the one thing I don't have time for these days is empty threats.
You want something on your stripper?
Get a subpoena.
I liked Christy.
She was one of my best dancers.
But I have nothing else to add.
I'm sorry.
We just need contact information.
That's all, Ms. Avarski, for the driver and the stripper.
Dancer.
Look, I would love... because we'd really hate to subpoena your books and client records.
You're East Indian?
Yeah.
Hmm, it's very popular these days.
Contact information?
Follow me.
Why a-b-c?
$1,500 an hour,
$2,100 and, uh,
$3,100.
What makes someone more expensive?
Is this about the rape?
No.
Regular clients and special requests.
Requests?
No condoms or being dominated or role-playing.
Whatever they can't get at home.
People would really pay $3,000 an hour?
The day rate is
$31,000, dawn to dawn.
So about this rape, can you get me contact information on this dancer?
Maura?
She quit right afterwards.
Left a fake number, fake address, fake social.
Happens all the time.
What about the driver?
Could you help me find him?
Zach so, mom, where are you, anyway?
Look, I have to work late tonight.
Can you ask grandma if she can stay till 10:00?
Sure.
Grandma, can you stay till 10:00?
Mom's working late.
No need to shout, dear.
If she has to, she has to.
Grandma can stay.
So, mom, I was talking to grandma, and she said she visited dad this weekend, and he was saying how much he missed us.
Grandma said that?
I was thinking maybe we should be going there.
You know, visiting him?
Your dad didn't want you to see him like that in prison.
He was... he didn't want you to worry.
But let me ask him... maybe he's changed his mind, okay?
Right.
We'll talk about it when I get home tonight, okay?
All right, see you tonight.
I trust you're doing your homework.
Five minutes.
We understand you can corroborate Christy's story.
Which was?
That she told you about the rape right after it happened.
Look, I like Christy, she's a good tipper, but when she drinks, she doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
But you do?
Christy gave the guy a lap dance, he paid her, we went home.
Nobody said anything about any rape.
I don't blame Christy for trying to get extra money out of McKeon, but, hey, she's lying.
Is that dad?
I don't know.
But you're thinking it, too.
Gonna need your help in a minute.
Dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.
Do we tell mom?
They sent them to mom to hurt her.
So I say no.
So?
I don't know.
Do they want to see me?
Oh, Zach does, but Grace doesn't?
She's hurt.
She thought you were everything.
So two months in, you seem well.
I am.
Some good guys here.
There's probably less backstabbing than the state attorney's office.
You look good.
It's like it agrees with you.
So, here's the thing about Childs.
Everything he does is a political calculation.
Everything he says...
Peter, no.
I don't want to be used.
Alicia, I know you don't believe me, but Childs set me up.
And if what I give you can help a rape victim, what's wrong with that?
How do you know she's a rape victim, Peter?
I didn't tell your mom.
Daniel told me.
Your appellate lawyer?
He's the one who referred Christy to you.
What's wrong?
I'm hard-pressed to think what's not wrong.
So he what...?
Well...
I mentioned to Daniel that you were with Stern, Lockhart, and that if he didn't have time for Christy's case that maybe you would.
I thought you'd want the work.
You thought it was a good idea to send me a hooker to represent?
No, I thought it was a good idea to send you a rape victim.
Oh, my God.
You had sex with her.
What?
You're using her first name, Peter.
You're saying "Christy."
She's one of your whores.
Oh, Alicia, would you stop it?
When are you gonna stop thinking that I slept with everyone?
When are you gonna forgive me, for christ sakes?
How much did you spend on Amber?
You had sex with her, what, ten times, 20 times?
You don't want to know the details of what I did.
If you want me to forgive you,
I need to know what I'm forgiving you for.
So 3,000$ a pop, that's what 60,000$?
Did you pay her not to use a condom?
Was that extra?
Your trip to Houston, did you take her with you?
You know I didn't.
I don't know what I know.
Grace's 12th birthday party, you s...
You said you had to leave early.
Where did you go, Peter?
You answer those questions, and then we will talk about forgiveness.
This is a pretrial hearing, so don't worry about the driver yet.
We just need to win a few motions.
Sorry!
Don't worry about it.
It all comes down to the rape kit.
Still no luck finding the other stripper.
All we have is a first name, "Maura,"
and a general description.
We need to box McKeon in.
There's only one of two ways his semen ends up in that rape kit:
consensual sex or rape.
We get him to swear there was no consensual sex.
Why would he do that?
'Cause he has a wife.
There you are.
How you doing?
You nervous?
No, but maybe I should be.
This is just a pretrial hearing.
State's attorney's trying to squash our subpoena, so today we just get the ground rules straight, in case this thing goes to trial.
Kalinda, I need you to get upstairs, get in the state's attorney's office and wait for the subpoena.
I'll do that.
What?
You don't have to.
I know.
I'll be back.
You all right?
Yeah, sure, I'm fine.
Oh, my God, this is too good.
We got Judge Abernathy.
He's our newest judge.
He's so liberal, he makes Michael Moore look like Rush Limbaugh.
Justice may be blind, but judges sure aren't.
God, Ericcson must be pulling his hair out.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Oh, please, don't stand.
Everybody sit back down, please.
We've got the big room here, don't we?
Your Honor, given the stature of my client, Mr. McKeon, and given the fact that this pretrial hearing has already garnered the attention of our friends in the press,
We would ask the court to seal the pretrial filings and avoid a show trial.
Oh, Mr. Ericcson, I don't think we need to do all that.
Do we?
First amendment issues and all?
I deny the petition with regret.
Mr. Gardner?
Yes, Your Honor.
We have a lot of testimony focusing on whether there was a consensual act between Mr. McKeon and my client, but if Mr. McKeon is willing to stipulate there was, indeed, a consensual sexual act, we would forego this testimony.
That's a good point.
Mr. Ericcson, how do you respond?
We will stipulate there was no sex of any kind, forced or consensual, Your Honor.
The plaintiff also requests an expedited trial date,
Your Honor, a DNA sample from Mr. McKeon,
DNA results from the rape kit, and the investigative reports from the state's attorney's office.
They have been... reluctant to furnish them.
Thank you, counselor.
I will grant all four motions.
Mr., uh...
Ericcson?
Ah.
I interpret from Mr. Ericcson's, uh, gesture that he acquiesces.
Well, I'll see you all back here...
Let's see.
My docket is clear.
Five days?
How's that for expedited?
Uh, as a side note, I would like to ask for a moment of silence for the recent mass killings in Darfur.
Okay, thank you.
Court adjourned.
That was a great start, huh?
I understand you're having trouble with the driver.
And you're boxed in on the rape kit.
You should just settle on our terms.
Yeah, right.
See you in trial.
May 15, four months ago.
This one seemed cool.
Hey.
So you know will?
12 clients, stockbroker types.
Mr. Gardner.
You two went to school together?
That's what they were saying the other night at drinks.
Yeah.
So that's why?
Cary, if you don't mind, I've had only a week with this.
You got an expedited trial date to force the other side to settle, and now you guys are the ones suffering.
What are you looking for?
"TZK Industries."
I...
I've seen it somewhere before.
What is TZK Industries?
"TZK Industries."
It's a furniture supply company.
"Supplying elegant furniture
To home and business." Why?
What do you need?
Something to undercut Christy's driver.
Okay.
Oh.
It can't be that easy, can it?
What?
So I find this odd, Mr. Grant.
You were there, and you say there was no rape?
So either you're lying or my client's lying.
All I know is what I saw.
Your Honor, request permission to approach the witness.
Yes.
Please.
Approach.
Mr. Grant, this is a copy of your wife's w-2.
Could you read the name of your wife's employer, please?
"TZK Industries."
And TZK Industries is a company owned by the McKeon family to supply furniture to their properties.
Objection.
Not in evidence.
Well, I think it's all right for it to be asked,
Mr. Ericcson.
I... actually, sustained.
Your Honor, you sustained the objection?
I did.
Mr. Ericcson had a point.
Isn't it an amazing coincidence, Mr. Grant, that after a year of unemployment, your wife got a job in June from the McKeon family, a month after the bachelor party incident?
No.
And why is that, Mr. Grant?
Because my wife and I are divorced.
My wife and I have been separated for a year now, so her getting this job has nothing to do with me.
But, sir, wouldn't you benefit even if only in the form of lowered spousal support?
I guess, but I'm not Warren Buffett.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm sorry.
I didn't see it.
Don't ever let your first chair get undercut like that again.
Good news?
I just got the rape kit results.
State's attorney wasn't stonewalling.
They sent it out to a commercial lab and just got it back.
And?
It's not McKeon's dna.
The rape kit came back.
It's not his sperm.
It's not McKeon's DNA.
Grant says you're lying.
McKeon says you're lying.
I'm not lying.
I...
It's really not his sperm?
Christy, we need to get the full... who else did you have sex with that night?
No one.
I swear.
Well, you obviously had sex with someone because it isn't his sperm.
So, was it a boyfriend or another client?
You need to find Maura.
We can't find Maura.
You really don't remember anything to help us find her?
We can't find Maura.
We didn't talk.
She was on her cell phone the whole night till her battery ran out.
I'm sorry.
I need to get to class.
Not that I mind it, but since when did you become me?
You didn't believe her.
I did.
Maybe she is telling the truth.
Christy said the light was flicked out, so maybe McKeon was with a friend.
So let's see if the cops tested the other party-goers.
Worth a try.
It's not just that.
What's up with your bud, Abernathy?
He's going out of his way to kill us.
You know how this works.
Liberal judge gets on the bench, doesn't want to rule from his bias, so he bends over backwards the other way.
I thought you said you had some pull with him.
He wanted to be on your glass ceiling committee or whatever it is. "Emily's list""
are you suggesting I influence a sitting judge in some untoward fashion?
No, just in a toward one.
Come on, come to the court, let him see your sad little liberal face... and contemplate a life without his friends.
Will, I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
We're a team.
No apologies.
Hey.
Now what are you doing?
Close the door.
Come on, Zach.
Just let it go.
Would you shut up and look at this?
See that?
It's called a "specular highlight."
It's like a light in the eye reflected in the eye.
See where it is?
It's to the left.
And now, look at this.
The lady's eye.
See?
The dot's to the right.
Okay... they're not in the same picture.
Dad's face was photoshopped into it.
Hello?
Zach, Grace, I'm home.
Jackie, I have a request to make.
Certainly, dear.
You want the kids to visit Peter in prison, you talk to me.
You don't talk to Zach.
When did I talk to Zach?
You told him Peter was lonely in prison.
Because he is.
Just don't go around me by talking to my kids.
Hey, mom.
Hey.
How was work?
It was crappy.
I thought I'd make breakfast.
For dinner?
My goodness.
Like when you were little.
You don't have to like it.
It's for me.
So, I want to show you some pictures of where dad's staying.
What?
I want to make sure you know what's involved with visiting dad in prison, okay?
I'll get that.
So, Zach, can you show me how to get to "google images" on your computer?
Yeah, sure.
What is that?
Nothing.
Homework.
Mom!
Someone's here!
Hi.
Still no Maura?
DNA is definitely not from McKeon's semen.
I was going to the crime lab to see if they ever collected DNA from the other party-goers when...
You can watch a little tv.
I'll be right in.
Want to do this later?
No, no, no.
I think I just caught my son checking out porn.
Anyway...
I asked a cop friend to run the rape kit results through codis.
And they got a hit.
Who, the best man?
Manny Lyons.
A rapist serving 20 to life in an Ohio supermax.
I don't understand.
You're in good company.
And he's a convicted rapist.
Christy was raped.
Apparently.
I don't get it.
Was he... was he at the party?
Well, as far as I can tell, he was in a holding cell in Columbus at the time.
This makes no sense.
We know.
This pile is everything on the Manny Lyons rape.
This pile, everything on ours.
And we can't find one thing in common.
No connection with McKeon?
Nope, we checked it.
"Manny Lyons broke into an Upper Arlington apartment, held a knife to the neck of a 40-year-old divorcee, raped her, and stole her car.
He was stopped running a traffic light ten miles away.
The divorcee identified him in a six-pack photo line-up."
What?
They do have one thing in common.
And you were the lab supervisor who worked on analysis 5795... the rape kit in this case... professor?
Doctor.
Doctor.
And these are your initials, "gg""
right at the bottom of the report?
Yes, those are mine.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
This isn't 5795.
Yes, this is 5794.
The Manny Lyons case.
My mistake.
Oh, I see that you ran the analysis on both cases.
Given the sequential numbering,
I imagine that you worked on one right after the other?
It appears so.
In both cases, the DNA matched the same culprit,
Manny Lyons, is that correct?
It is.
So let... let me follow the logic here.
Manny Lyons... who never set foot in Chicago...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
I will sustain that.
Isn't it true, Dr. Girtzman, the only connection between Manny Lyons and Christy barbosa is that you worked on both cases?
Objection.
Argumentative.
Mrs. Florrick, this is not a debating society.
Sustained.
Dr. Girtzman, would you say that the standard of a commercial lab is relaxed?
No.
And, uh, Your Honor, may I answer her earlier question?
Personal privilege.
Oh, yeah, if you'd like.
We handle an immense backlog of untested rape kits from crime labs all across the country.
We do so with speed and professionalism...
And yet isn't it true, sir, that your lab almost lost its accreditation in 2005...
Now, that was never proved!
When it cross-contaminated two DNA samples that were out-sourced from a crime lab...
This is an old slander!
That you failed to sterilize scissors that then carried the DNA from one sample to the next?
I don't have to answer this.
Actually, you do, sir.
Your Honor, given this testimony, we move that the rape kit be reexamined at a second genetic lab.
I think that is an understandable request, Mr. Ericcson.
Your Honor, we would stipulate that Mrs. Florrick has proven her case.
Dr. Girtzman cross-contaminated the sample...
Excuse me?
But we would argue, therefore, that that is the very reason it cannot be tested again.
You've got to be kidding me.
The very fact that it is agreed that the sample is now contaminated means it can't possibly be tested with any authority.
Your Honor...
Mr. Gardner, you argued that the rape kit was contaminated.
You can't now argue it's probative.
The plaintiff's motion for retesting is denied.
Your Honor...!
Motion is denied.
We've got to find that other stripper.
So basically this is a hail mary pass?
Look at you with the sports metaphors.
Yeah, I don't see many other options here.
Good evening.
Do you have a reservation?
Actually, we have a... strange request.
We need to get a printout of a phone bill from four months ago.
The name?
McKeon.
First name?
Lloyd.
Would you liked that e-mailed or a hard copy?
Hard copy.
If I could just see some I.D., Mr. McKeon.
Um, well, actually can I ask you a question...
Rosemary?
There was a bachelor party here in May that resulted in a... a rape.
Were you here then?
I was.
Well, the only person we believe who can corroborate the rape victim's story was using a cell phone that night.
And we're thinking she used the bathroom phone when her battery ran out.
We were hoping to glance at the bill just to see if there was a number she dialed.
I'll have to speak to a manager.
Nice thought.
If all else fails, try honesty.
I got 20 bucks on deception.
Will?
Oh, hey.
What are you doing north of the loop?
You know, just seeing how the other half lives.
Alicia, this is Marlena.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.
Ask for a view of the lake.
It's beautiful at night.
She thinks we're getting a room.
Yep.
Now they all think we're getting a room.
You worried?
You?
We could do worse.
I'm having trouble getting my manager.
If you could just wait another minute.
I owe you $20.
Okay, Christy and Maura arrived at 10:15.
Right there, 11:20.
Out-of-state area code.
Hello.
You don't know me...
Were you the other dancer there that night, Maura?
I was, yes.
And your driver, Mr. Grant, what did he tell you after you took Christy to the hospital?
He told us that the McKeons were very rich, and we should all keep our mouths shut.
And that's why you went back home to Michigan?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I was scared.
And to reiterate,
Christy told you about the rape immediately afterward?
Yes.
In fact, he followed her out intoarking lot and he said, "don't tell anyone.
Just take the money and shut up."
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Alicia.
For... you know.
Christy, I'm just curious.
Where did you meet my husband?
Your husband?
I've never met your husband.
My mistake.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Good afternoon.
I have given this case quite a bit of thought, as you can imagine.
You have both argued your case well.
But I find myself judging in favor of the defendant.
Without a DNA match to the rape kit, we have a classic he-said, she-said; and as much as my personal sympathies lie with the plaintiff, the evidence does not warrant a favorable decision.
Judgment in favor of the defense.
Are you okay?
No.
I'm sorry.
I believe you.
This is all I want to say.
I have been falsely accused by a woman who wanted nothing more than a quick payday.
But every year there are thousands of women who are abused, and I don't think we should let this false accusation...
Mr. McKeon.
You're under arrest for the rape of Christy Barbosa.
Wha...?
Cuff him.
What?
Is this a joke?
It must be hard to lose, Mrs. Florrick.
Not if it forces you to prosecute.
I'm coming out of this with a criminal case I'll win, and you're coming out with a loss.
Nice job.
Lloyd McKeon was arrested today for rape, literally seconds after he was cleared in a civil case for the identical crime.
State's attorney Glenn Childs took credit for finding an untainted sample of DNA that will guarantee McKeon's conviction in a criminal trial.
Childs denied that McKeon's arrest was a reaction to...
This is yours?
Yeah.
Is he going to jail?
I think so.
Well, then that's good.
Thanks.
Good night.
Good night.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to beg.
Please... oh... does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God, please...
You're amazing...
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do to you?
Just... don't... stop.
What'll you give me?
What'll you give me not to stop?
Everything.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
But I do admit to a failure of judgment in my dealings with these women.
I've never abused my office for sexual favors.
Give us time to heal and rebuild their trust.
Mom, breakfast!
Oh, hey, congratulations.
That's great.
Your husband, looks like he could get out of prison.
- Looks like it.
- Early Show had a story on it.
- Stuff on you too.
Catch it?
- No, I missed it.
Yeah, I caught it online.
I could send you the link.
- That's okay.
- No, no, no.
It's easy.
Litigation wants me on this new class action.
That's where I'm headed.
What about you?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, in here I guess.
When did you say this was?
May 15th.
Four months ago.
Do you have anything with the date?
A parking receipt.
Had you ever met Mr. McKeon before?
No.
I'd seen his family on the news.
I heard about their hotels and stuff, but that's about it.
Well, the problem here, Christy, is that any civil suit could be seen as opportunistic.
Because of their money?
- Yes.
I'm sorry, but I didn't choose my rapist.
This kid doesn't know what she's in for, taking on McKeon.
- Alicia, if you don't mind, we need to...
- It's all right.
Stay.
I don't know about this.
It's a criminal case, not a civil one.
Except the new state's attorney rejected the charges.
Yeah, because it's got Duke lacrosse written all over it.
- Oh, come on.
- Put your politics aside, Diane.
You're Glenn Childs, you get this dropped in your lap, a stripper at a bachelor party accusing the son of the most powerful family in Chicago of rape, and you don't think it's Duke lacrosse 2?
He's worried about the McKeon family money.
He's worried about their campaign contributions.
Well, I'm worried that we're overextended.
How many Sheffrin-Marks depos do we have left?
- Two-ten.
- We need to keep our eye on the ball.
And Christy is just gonna look like she's trying to make some quick cash.
Do you believe her?
I believe a lot of things I can't prove.
All right, here's what I think.
I know the McKeon family lawyer.
- Ericcson?
- Right, William Ericcson.
That's just what we need, two Wills.
McKeon's are gonna keep this out of the press.
So my guess is, they throw her some cash.
Maybe 50 grand or so to keep her quiet.
Yeah.
William Ericcson's office.
- Mr. Ericcson, please.
May I tell him who's calling?
Tell him it's the other Will.
I want you to be at this lunch.
Don't say anything, just listen and look serious.
I can do that.
- How you holding up here?
- I'm holding up.
Oh, yeah.
How do you know her?
- Who?
- Christy?
I don't.
Then why did she ask for you to be on the case?
I don't know.
Ericcson here.
Will.
Will.
I think you know why I'm calling.
Two months ago Peter Florrick was sentenced to ten years for bribery and corruption.
Today was the first step toward his release.
He was known in Chicago simply as The Hammer.
He jailed cop killers, CEO's, corrupt politicians, until The Hammer got hammered.
An hour ago I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
Within weeks,
Chicago's incorruptible state's attorney found himself with all the trappings of a modern American scandal.
A rival with an eye on his job, an embarrassed wife, a blushing call girl, and an R-rated sex tape.
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God, please, you are...
- Hey, ever heard the whole thing?
- No.
You're the only one who hasn't.
Everything I have on McKeon.
What?
I beat you three sets to two.
Oh, come on.
You don't even believe that.
This is driving me crazy.
How do I know you?
- Me?
- Minor, Parsons Layton?
Alicia's actually our newest junior associate, one month in.
Will Ericcson, Alicia Florrick.
It's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- You too.
- I'm rooting for your husband.
I know he has a lot of enemies in this town, but I always root for the underdog.
No, no, just ignore him.
The only reason someone's forced out of public office in America these days is sex.
So let's talk about Lloyd McKeon.
So sad, really.
I remember when you had a respectable firm, Will.
One that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these.
And what charges might those be, Will?
I haven't said anything yet.
Do you think you're the first firm she's shopping this lawsuit to?
There's nothing there.
Even the new state's attorney thinks there's nothing there.
And yet I got you to a settlement lunch on a half-hour's notice.
Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage?
- You wanna know what I would say?
- I would.
I would say you're trying to change the subject from rape.
Well, I would agree that as offensive and misguided as these charges are, the optics aren't exactly in our favor, so we're willing to make an offer.
It's non-negotiable.
You have till end of business day.
McKeon did it.
Under 100 thou, I would have said no.
- Over 100 thou...
- How about well over?
If you don't mind my asking, Miss Barbosa, why did you request me?
I saw you on TV.
I thought you'd understand what it's like to be misunderstood.
Ladies.
Sorry about that.
McKeon's lawyers made a financial offer that Diane and I actually agree on.
A first.
It's a cash settlement, $450,000.
You're kidding?
We don't have to go to court?
He just offered that?
You'll have to sign a confidentiality agreement.
Both parties free each other of liability and agree not to speak to anyone.
- What?
It's standard in civil agreements.
I want everybody to know he settled.
Can't we tell the police?
Not if we sign a confidentiality agreement.
McKeon could withdraw the award and sue you for defamation.
- What do you think?
- I think under the circum...
I think you're looking for justice, Christy.
And sometimes justice comes in a form we don't expect.
If you take this money, the settlement will be known to the two people that matter most:
You and him.
I'm sorry, no.
He'll know how much it costs to rape somebody and get away with it.
That's all.
This is about him admitting that he did this to me.
She's right.
Okay, Ericcson, how flexible are you on confidentiality?
Exclude new criminal discovery.
Oh, come on.
This isn't...
You wanna go to court, is that it?
Take it as far as pre-trial?
He doesn't wanna go to trial.
Look, Ericcson, you wanna make McKeon The Bachelor Party Rapist, be my...
That's how you wanna play it?
We turned down a half a million bucks.
Feels good, doesn't it?
Looks like we got a case.
You have to size these things up pretty quickly.
Twelve clients.
Stockbroker types.
No one out of control.
It was easy.
They paid $400 for a 90-minute two-girl fantasy strip.
Two-girl?
Who's the other girl?
Maura.
I don't remember her last name.
That was the only time she...
Sorry.
She insists on being here during all of this.
It's a nightmare.
And McKeon, how'd you meet him?
The groom?
He offered me another $100 for a private lap dance.
When I got in the bedroom, he locked the door.
Then he grabbed me.
I tried to get the Mace from my bag.
I tried to shout.
Did you tell anyone afterwards?
Maura, and our driver, Grant.
He suggested she drive me to the hospital for the rape exam.
And the service, Worldwide Elite, how long did you work for them?
- Two years.
- And what else did you do there?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what else did you do there?
For a year, I was an escort.
Didn't you think that might be important to tell us?
I haven't gone on a call in a year.
I was in an abusive relationship.
I needed the money to move out.
When I moved, I stopped working.
But still stripped.
So, what's your point?
A call girl can't get raped?
Yeah, that's my point, thanks.
Look, she lied to us.
Why believe her now?
She walked away from half a million dollars.
And when did she ever lie to us?
The more you bond, the less helpful you are.
Your stripper was hooking.
Why is she my stripper when she does something bad?
Okay, so the point is to prepare for trial so we don't actually have to go to trial.
- Cary, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice suit.
I got a job for you.
I need you take Alicia's Sheffrin-Marks depos for the week.
- All right, I'm on it.
This is settlement poker.
No one wants to go to trial, but the person who plays the better hand makes the better deal.
So get me some good cards.
And so your first thought is to come to the state's attorney's office.
I just need one thing.
- And why would I help you with that?
- Because you like me.
- That still works with people?
Mm.
Like a charm.
You never should have quit.
I didn't quit.
I was fired.
Come on, you ran a solid rape investigation.
You should be dying to slip us the witness interviews.
Leah, could you come outside for a second?
And you're telling me your husband had nothing to do with this?
Mr. Childs, my law firm is bringing on a civil action, that's all.
To embarrass my office, make it look like I don't care about a rape victim.
A happy coincidence?
I understand the need to blame someone for your husband's downfall.
But I didn't release that sex tape to hurt you or your family.
I have kids too.
You should know, I was holding back.
I had more to release about your husband.
A lot more.
Disturbing things.
But out of compassion, I held back.
Mr. Childs, if you have something to show me, just do it, okay?
Because the one thing I don't have time for these days is empty threats.
You want something on your stripper?
Get a subpoena.
I like Christy.
She was one of my best dancers, but I have nothing else to add.
I'm sorry.
We just need contact information, Ms. Avraski, for the driver and stripper.
Dancer.
Look, I would love...
Because we'd really hate to subpoena your books and client records.
- You're East Indian?
- Yeah.
Hm.
It's very popular these days.
Contact information?
Follow me.
Why A, B, C?
Fifteen hundred an hour, 2,100, and 3,100.
What makes someone more expensive?
Is this about the rape?
No.
Regular clients, and special requests.
Requests?
No condoms.
Or being dominated.
Or role-playing.
Whatever they can't get at home.
People would really pay $3,000 an hour?
The day rate is $31,000, dawn to dawn.
So about this rape, can you get me contact information on this dancer?
Maura?
She quit right afterwards.
Left a fake number, fake address, fake social.
Happens all the time.
What about the driver?
Could you help me find him?
So, Mom, where are you anyway?
Look, I have to work late tonight.
Can you ask Grandma if she can stay until 10?
Sure.
Grandma, can you stay until 10?
Mom's working late.
No need to shout, dear.
If she has to, she has to.
Grandma can stay.
I was talking to Grandma, and she said she visited Dad this weekend, and he was saying how much he missed us.
Grandma said that?
I was thinking maybe we should be going there.
You know, visiting him.
Your dad didn't want you to see him like that, in prison.
He was...
He didn't want you to worry.
But let me ask him.
Maybe he's changed his mind, okay?
Right.
We'll talk about it when I get home tonight, okay?
All right, see you tonight.
I trust you're doing your homework.
Five minutes.
- You can corroborate Christy's story?
- Which was?
That she told you about the rape right after it happened.
Look, I like Christy, she's a good tipper, but when she drinks she doesn't know what she's talking about.
But you do.
Christy gave a lap dance, he paid, we went home.
Nobody said anything about rape.
I don't blame Christy for trying to get money out of McKeon.
But, hey, she's lying.
Is that Dad?
I don't know.
But you're thinking it too.
I'm gonna need your help in a minute.
Dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.
Should we tell Mom?
They sent them to Mom to hurt her, so I say no.
So?
I don't know, do they wanna see me?
Oh, Zach does, but Grace doesn't?
She's hurt.
She thought you were everything.
So two months in, you seem well.
I am.
There's some good guys here.
There's probably less backstabbing than the State Attorney's Office.
You look good.
It's like it agrees with you.
So here's the thing about Childs.
Everything he does is a political calculation...
Peter, no.
I don't wanna be used.
Alicia, I know you don't believe me, but Childs set me up, and if what I give you can help a rape victim, what's wrong with that?
How do you know she's a rape victim, Peter?
I didn't tell your mom.
Daniel told me.
Your appellate lawyer?
He's the one who referred Christy to you.
What's wrong?
I'm hard-pressed to think what's not wrong.
So he what?
Well, I mentioned to Daniel that you were at Stern, Lockhart, and that if he didn't have time for Christy's case that maybe you would.
I thought you'd want the work.
You thought it was a good idea to send me a hooker to represent?
No, I thought it was a good idea to send you a rape victim.
Oh, my God.
You had sex with her.
What?
You're using her first name, Peter.
You're saying Christy.
She's one of your whores.
Alicia, would you stop it?
When are you gonna stop thinking that I slept with everyone?
When are you gonna forgive me, for God's sake?
How much did you spend on Amber?
You had sex with her, what?
Ten times, 20 times?
You don't wanna know the details of what I did.
If you want me for forgive you, I need to know what I'm forgiving you for.
So at $3,000 a pop, that's what?
Sixty thousand dollars?
Did you pay her not to use a condom?
Was that extra?
Your trip to Houston.
Did you take her with you?
- You know I didn't.
- I don't know what I know.
Attention:
Today's visitation is now over.
Grace's 12th birthday party, you said...
You said you had to leave early.
Where did you go, Peter?
You answer those questions, and then we'll talk about forgiveness.
This is a pre-trial hearing, so don't worry about the driver yet.
We just need to win a few motions.
- Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
It all comes down to the rape kit.
Still no luck finding the other stripper.
All we have is a first name, Maura.
And a general description.
We need to box McKeon in.
There's only one of two ways his semen ends up that rape kit.
Consensual sex or rape.
We get him to swear there was no consensual sex.
Why would he do that?
Because he has a wife.
There you are.
How you doing?
You nervous?
No, but maybe I should be?
This is just a pre-trial hearing.
The state's attorney is trying to squash our subpoena.
We get the ground rules straight in case this thing goes to trial.
Kalinda, get in the state's attorney's office, and wait for the subpoena.
I'll do that.
What?
You don't have to.
I know.
I'll be back.
- You all right?
- Yeah, sure.
I'm fine.
Oh, my God.
This is too good.
We've got Judge Abernathy.
He's our newest judge.
He's so liberal, he makes Michael Moore look like Rush Limbaugh.
Justice may be blind, but judges sure aren't.
God, Ericcson must be pulling his hair out.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Oh, please don't stand, everybody.
Sit back down, please.
We've got a big room here, don't we?
Your Honor, given the stature of my client, Mr. McKeon, and given the fact that this pre-trial hearing has already garnered the attention of our friends in the press, we ask the court to seal the pre-trial filings and avoid a show trial.
Oh, Mr. Ericcson, I don't think we need to do all that, do we?
First Amendment issues and all?
I deny the petition with regret.
- Mr. Gardner?
- Yes, Your Honor.
We have a lot of testimony focusing on whether there was a consensual act between Mr. McKeon and my client.
But if Mr. McKeon is willing to stipulate there was a consensual sexual act, we would forego this testimony.
That's a good point.
Mr. Ericcson, how do you respond?
We would stipulate there was no sex of any kind, forced or consensual, Your Honor.
The plaintiff requests an expedited trial date, Your Honor.
A DNA sample from Mr. McKeon, DNA results from the rape kit, and the reports from the state's attorney.
They have been reluctant to furnish them.
Thank you, counselor, I will grant all four motions.
Mr. Ericcson?
I interpret from Mr. Ericcson's gesture that he acquiesces.
Well, I'll see you all back here...
Let's see, my docket is clear.
Five days?
How's that for expedited?
As a side note,
I would like to ask for a moment of silence for the recent mass killings in Darfur.
Okay, thank you.
Court adjourned.
That was a great start, huh?
You're having trouble with the driver?
You've boxed in on the rape kit.
You should settle on our terms.
Yeah, right.
See you in trial.
May 15th, four months ago.
This one seemed cool, this one...
- Hey, so you know Will?
- Twelve clients.
Stockbroker types.
You two went to school together?
That's what they were saying the other night at drinks.
Yeah.
- So that's why.
Cary, if you don't mind, I've had only a week with this.
You've got an expedited trial date to force the other side to settle and now you guys are the ones suffering.
- What are you looking for?
- TZK Industries.
I've seen it somewhere before.
What is TZK Industries?
TZK Industries.
It's a furniture supply company, supplying elegant furniture.
Why, what do you need?
Something to undercut Christy's driver.
Okay.
Oh.
It can't be that easy, can it?
What?
Now, I find this odd, Mr. Grant.
You were there, and you say there was no rape.
So either you're lying or my client's lying.
All I know is what I saw, sir.
Request permission to approach the witness.
Yes, please.
Approach.
Mr. Grant, this is a copy of your wife's W-2.
Could you read the name of your wife's employer, please?
"TZK Industries."
And TZK Industries is a company owned by the McKeon family to supply furniture to...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
Well, I think it's all right for it to be asked, Mr. Ericcson.
L...
Actually, sustained.
You sustained the objection?
I did.
Mr. Ericcson has a point.
Isn't it an amazing coincidence, Mr. Grant, that after a year of unemployment your wife got a job in June, from the McKeon family, a month after the bachelor party incident?
- No.
- And why is that, Mr. Grant?
Because my wife and I are divorced.
My wife and I have been separated for a year now.
So her getting this job has nothing to do with me.
But, sir, wouldn't you benefit, even if only in the form of lowered spousal support?
I guess, but I'm not Warren Buffet.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm sorry, I didn't see it.
Don't ever let your first chair get undercut like that again.
Good news?
I just got the rape kit results.
The state's attorney wasn't stonewalling.
They sent it out to a commercial lab and just got it back.
And?
It's not McKeon's DNA.
The rape kit came back.
It's not his sperm.
It's not McKeon's DNA.
Grant says you're lying.
- McKeon says you're lying.
- I'm not lying.
L...
- It's really not his sperm?
- Christy, we need to get the full...
- Who else did you have sex with?
- No one, I swear.
Well, you obviously had sex with someone because it isn't his sperm.
So was it a boyfriend?
Or another client?
You need to find Maura.
We can't find Maura.
You really don't remember anything that could help us find her?
We didn't talk.
She was on her cell phone the whole night until her battery ran out.
I'm sorry,
I need to get to class.
Not that I mind it, but since when did you become me?
- You didn't believe her, I did.
- Maybe she is telling the truth.
Christy said the light was flicked out, so maybe McKeon was with a friend.
So let's see if the cops tested the other party-goers.
Worth a try.
It's not just that.
What's up with your bud, Abernathy?
He's going out of his way to kill us.
Liberal judge gets on the bench, doesn't want to rule from his bias, so he bends the other way.
You said you had some pull.
He wanted to be on your Glass Ceiling committee.
Emily's List.
Are you suggesting I influence a sitting judge in some untoward fashion?
No, just in a toward one.
Come on, come to the court, let him see your sad little liberal face and contemplate a life without his friends.
Will, I'm so sorry.
Don't be, we're a team.
No apologies.
Hey.
Now what are you doing?
- Close the door.
- Come on, Zach, just let it go.
Would you shut up and look at this?
You see that?
It's called a specular highlight.
It's like a light in the eye, reflected in the eye.
See where it is?
It's to the left.
Now, look at this.
The lady's eye.
See?
The dot is to the right.
- Okay.
- They're not in the same picture.
Dad's face was Photoshopped into it.
Hello?
Zach, Grace, I'm home.
Jackie, I have a request to make.
Certainly, dear.
If you want the kids to visit Peter in prison, you talk to me.
- You don't talk to Zach.
- When did I talk to Zach?
You told him Peter was lonely.
Because he is.
Just don't go around me by talking to my kids.
Hey, Mom.
Hey.
- How was work?
- It was crappy.
I thought I'd make breakfast.
For dinner?
My goodness.
Like when you were little.
You don't have to like it.
It's for me.
So I wanna show you some pictures of where Dad's staying.
What?
I wanna make sure you know what's involved with visiting Dad in prison, okay?
I'll get that.
So, Zach, can you show me how to get to Google images on your computer?
Yeah, sure.
What is that?
Nothing.
Homework.
Mom?
Someone's here.
Hi.
Still no Maura?
DNA is definitely not from McKeon's semen.
I was going to the crime lab to see if they ever collected DNA from the other party-goers when...
You can watch a little TV.
I'll be right in.
Wanna do this later?
No, no, no.
I think I just caught my son checking out porn.
Anyway, I asked a cop friend to run the rape kit results through CODIS.
And they got a hit.
Who?
The best man?
Manny Lyons.
A rapist serving 20-to-life in an Ohio supermax.
- I don't understand.
- You're in good company.
And he's a convicted rapist.
So Christy was raped.
Apparently.
I don't get it.
Was he...?
Was he at the party?
As far as I can tell, he was in the holding cell in Columbus at the time.
This makes no sense.
We know.
This pile is everything on the Manny Lyons rape.
This pile, everything on ours.
And we can't find one thing in common.
No connection with McKeon?
No.
We checked it.
"Manny Lyons broke into an upper Arlington apartment, held a knife to the neck of a 40-year divorcee, raped her, and stole her car.
He was stopped running a traffic light ten miles away.
The divorcee identified him in a six-pack photo lineup."
What?
They do have one thing in common.
And you're the lab supervisor who worked on analysis 5795.
The rape kit in this case, professor?
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
And these are your initials, G.G., right at the bottom of the report?
Yes, those are mine.
Oh, excuse me.
This isn't 5795, this is 5794.
The Manny Lyons case.
My mistake.
Oh, I see that you ran the analysis on both cases.
Given the sequential numbering,
I imagine that you worked on one right after the other.
It appears so.
In both cases, the DNA matched the same culprit, Manny Lyons, is that correct?
- It is.
- So let...
Let me follow the logic here.
Manny Lyons, who never set foot in Chicago...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
I will sustain that.
Isn't it true, Dr. Girtzman, the only connection between Manny Lyons and Christy Barbosa is that you worked on both cases?
Objection.
Argumentative.
Mrs. Florrick, this is not a debating society.
Sustained.
Dr. Girtzman, would you say that the standard of a commercial lab is relaxed?
No.
And, Your Honor, may I answer her earlier question, personal privilege?
Oh, yeah, if you'd like.
We handle an immense backlog of untested rape kits from crime labs all across the country.
We do so with speed and professionalism.
And yet isn't it true, sir, that your lab almost lost its accreditation in 2005...
No, that was never proved.
- When you cross-contaminated two DNA samples?
This is an old slander.
That you failed to sterilize scissors, that carried the DNA from one sample to the next?
- I don't have to answer this.
- Actually, you do, sir.
Your Honor, given this testimony, we move that the rape kit be re-examined at a second genetic lab.
I think that is an understandable request, Mr. Ericcson.
Your Honor, we would stipulate that Mrs. Florrick has proven her case.
Dr. Girtzman cross-contaminated the samples.
But we argue that is the very reason they cannot be tested again.
You gotta be kidding me.
The very fact that it is agreed that the sample is now contaminated, means it can't possibly be tested with any authority.
Mr. Gardner, you argued that the rape kit was contaminated.
You can't now argue it's probative.
The plaintiff's motion for retesting is denied.
- Your Honor...
- Motion is denied.
We gotta find that other stripper.
So basically, this is a Hail Mary pass?
Look at you with the sports metaphors.
Yeah, I don't see many other options here.
Good evening, do you have a reservation?
Actually, we have a strange request.
We need to get a printout of a phone bill from four months ago.
- The name?
- McKeon.
First name?
Lloyd.
Would you like that e-mailed or a hard copy?
Hard copy.
If I could just see some ID, Mr. McKeon.
Well, actually, can I ask you a question, Rosemary?
There was a bachelor party here in May that resulted in a rape.
- Were you here then?
- I was.
Well, the only person we believe who can corroborate the rape victim's story was using a cell phone that night, and we're thinking she used the bathroom phone when her battery ran out.
We were hoping to glance at the bill just to see if there was a number she dialed.
I'll have to speak to our manager.
Nice thought.
If all else fails, try honesty.
I got 20 bucks on deception.
- Will?
- Oh, hey.
What are you doing north of the loop?
Oh, you know, seeing how the other half lives.
Alicia, this is Marlana.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
Ask for a view of the lake.
It's beautiful at night.
She thinks we're getting a room.
Yep.
Now they all think we're getting a room.
- You worried?
- You?
We could do worse.
I'm having trouble getting my manager.
If you could just wait another minute.
I owe you 20.
Okay, Christy and Maura arrived at 10:15.
Right there, 11:20.
Out of state area code.
Hello, you don't know me...
Were you the other dancer there that night, Maura?
I was, yes.
And your driver, Mr. Grant, what did he tell you after you took Christy to the hospital?
He told us that the McKeons were very rich and we should all keep our mouth shut.
And that's why you went home to Michigan?
Yes.
- I'm sorry, I was scared.
- It's okay.
And to reiterate,
Christy told you about the rape immediately afterward?
Yes, in fact, he followed her out into the parking lot.
And he said, "Don't tell anyone.
Just take the money and shut up."
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Alicia, for, you know...
Christy, I'm just curious.
Where did you meet my husband?
Your husband?
I've never met your husband.
My mistake.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Good afternoon.
I have given this case quite a bit of thought, as you can imagine.
You have both argued your case well, but I find myself judging in favor of the defendant.
Without a DNA match to the rape kit, we have a classic "he said, she said."
And as much as my personal sympathies lie with the plaintiff, the evidence does not warrant a favorable decision.
Judgment in favor of the defense.
Are you okay?
No.
I'm sorry.
I believe you.
There he is.
Lloyd, tell us what happened.
Do you feel you can get your good name back?
This is all I wanna say.
I have been falsely accused by a woman who wanted nothing more than a quick pay day.
But every year, there are thousands of women who are abused, and I don't think we should let this false accusation...
Mr. McKeon, you are under arrest for the rape of Christy Barbosa.
- What?
- Cuff him.
- What?
- What's going on?
McKEON:
Is this a joke?
It must be hard to lose, Mrs. Florrick.
Not if it forces you to prosecute.
I'm coming out of this with a criminal case I'll win.
You're coming out with a loss.
Nice job.
Lloyd McKeon was arrested today for rape literally seconds after he was cleared in a civil case for the identical crime.
State's Attorney Glenn Childs took credit for finding an untainted sample of DNA that will guarantee McKeon's conviction in a criminal trial.
Childs denied that McKeon's arrest...
This is yours?
Yeah.
Is he going to jail?
I think so.
Well, then, that's good.
Thanks.
Good night.
- Good night.
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God.
Please.
You are amazing.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do to you?
Just don't stop.
What'll you give me?
What'll you give me not to stop?
Everything.
Previously on the good wife,
- Sorry about that, Mr...
- McVeigh.
Oh, my goodness.
What an unfortunate name.
Hopefully no relation.
- Oh, I've offended you?
- No...
No, I'll talk to you soon.
I think I've just been visited by the Marlboro man.
They're playing craps with that kid's life.
No, you listen.
I know you did everything.
We're not gonna talk about this.
We're not gonna say any more.
We're gonna go to dinner in one week's time, and we'll talk then.
Hey.
Let's go to the bedroom.
No.
Here.
So we can talk now, right?
I mean, the trial's over.
We can talk now.
Yeah, we can talk.
We can swear.
We can do whatever we want.
Okay, so, we'll do bathroom breaks first, then, uh, get down to it.
So, uh, what do you think?
- Guilty, right?
- She did it.
Actually, I think we should wait.
For everybody.
Did you see her at the defense table?
Which her?
The one with the televangelist?
- No, no, no.
Um, the one who sucked the toes.
- Huh?
Oh, come on.
What was his name?
The prostitute.
You're talking about the defense attorney?
She's the wife, right?
Right.
I thought I recognized her.
At the defense table.
Reasonable doubt.
What do we mean by reasonable doubt?
I thought the husband got out.
- Didn't he get out?
- Boy, talk about using her.
Putting her at the defense table like that.
She's there 'cause she's a good lawyer.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Everybody ready?
Do we want to vote first?
Right.
Good idea.
Um, everyone take a pad.
So when you take that vote, you have to ask yourself, is this young woman capable of murder?
Could Bianca Price pick up a gun and shoot her sorority mate in the chest?
Okay.
Six guilty, six not guilty.
- Of course.
- Which is so odd, given we have six men and six women.
Oh, what are you saying, this is a sexist thing?
Well, of course not.
This has nothing to do with her looks.
True.
That's right.
She's just a sweet girl having a threesome.
That's because men can't imagine a pretty woman killing somebody.
Oh, come on.
It's because the prosecution didn't do their job.
- Exactly.
- Oh, fine.
Sure, I voted not guilty, but not because of her looks.
Why isn't it just as likely that women are jealous of her looks?
Thank you, brother.
You are so over the line.
- Thank you.
- He's right.
- So over the line.
- He's right.
Women look at that girl and think home wrecker.
Except she's not a girl.
She's a grown woman.
Okay, but Saint...
what... what's her name?
- Alicia.
- Right, Alicia Florrick.
She was sitting right next to her, supporting her.
And defense attorneys could never be pulling tricks.
Let's just stick to the facts, huh?
All right, all right, everybody, raised hands, please.
One at a time.
Marisol.
Okay, take the cop, the Detective.
Back on the first day of testimony, he looked right at us and said...
The accused was covered with blood.
And she was the only one in the room with the victim.
And the murder weapon?
9mm auto 6-round.
It was the defendant's, registered in her name.
Given to her by her mother for protection.
The weapon was found on the ground by her feet?
Yes, sir.
With her fingerprints on the trigger.
I have a question.
Who was the girl who entered in the middle of his testimony?
Oh, that's right.
He smiled at her.
I thought she was with the defense.
There was a party downstairs for spring break.
30 individuals.
- And they heard the shot?
- Yes, sir.
Within 30 seconds, they burst into the sorority room and found the accused, Bianca Price, standing over the victim.
How long after the murder was this photo taken?
Approximately 30 seconds.
That's the good news about murders at colleges these days.
Everybody has a cell phone camera, so it makes it hard
-to get away with murder.
-Objection!
That wasn't a question, Mr. Gardner.
But I would warn the witness to avoid editorializing.
My apologies, Your Honor.
- Now, this happened at her sorority house?
- Yes, sir.
There was blood all over her.
And this was taken within 30 seconds of the gunshot, and here she is with the gun at her feet.
She said she was in the bathroom, and she came out.
No, she didn't say that.
Her lawyer said that.
Now Bianca has said she was in the bathroom when she heard the shot.
Objection, Your Honor.
Not in evidence.
Mr. Gardner, I expect more of you.
Your Honor, I'm sorry.
My mistake.
Okay, I'll say it.
I didn't trust that cop.
And his earring.
What was that?
Men wear earrings these days.
And what about the five o'clock shadow?
So what are you saying?
You don't trust him because he didn't shave?
So, Detective Burton, you were the first officer on the scene?
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
And where was your partner?
He was out sick.
So you were there unobserved?
Yes, I was unobserved, except for the two dozen other college students in the room.
And you've never tampered with evidence, Detective?
That's correct, sir.
I've never tampered with evidence.
And so if I asked you about this internal affairs report...
Objection, Your Honor!
Mr. Gardner, really.
Up here.
Then what about the internal affairs report?
What internal affairs report?
!
We didn't hear anything about that.
It could have been completely innocent.
Are you serious?
This charge is irrelevant, and it was minor.
Drinking beer on duty?
You are playing with fire here, Mr. Gardner.
Your Honor, any internal affairs charge is completely relevant.
No, sir.
You're trying to imply to the jury that something more nefarious is going on here... that Detective Burton planted evidence.
Let's at least be adults here and admit to each other what you're doing.
Your Honor, no.
Oh...
oh, my God, no.
No.
I...
Look, I will admonish the jury.
That's all I can do, Mr. Brody.
And you watch it, Mr. Gardner.
Go to hell.
Having fun?
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
The Judge admonished us not to consider it.
All right, I won't consider it, but I still don't trust speedy.
We'll reconvene here 9:30 tomorrow.
So, you enjoy tarnishing my reputation?
Best part of my day.
Hey, Jimmy, man.
What's up?
I don't think they liked me.
Who, the jury?
No.
You can never tell.
I just...
Sound so terrible.
I think I'd find me guilty.
No, that's just the prosecution's case.
You wait for our turn.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Any time.
Thank you.
I'll see you, mom.
How did it go, did you think?
It's a good start.
I'm sorry, but we're playing catch-up here.
Your previous lawyers did no investigation, and Cuesta isn't allowing a delay, so we're gonna hit a few bumps.
We're gonna need to spend some more money on a better ballistics expert.
Are you all right with that?
Whatever it takes.
She's my only child.
The thought of her in prison is...
Good work.
Thanks.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
Why?
Yeah.
Good.
I heard you did well.
There's more women on this jury than I wanted.
Sometimes I think justice would be better served with a coin flip.
Who's that?
Oh, uh, mother Jones.
Doing a profile.
Sorry about that.
We're knee-deep in the Bianca Price trial.
You were just saying about pro-choice.
Oh, yes, it's an irony of our times that "activist Judge" used to be a charge hurled by Republicans at...
Democrats?
Excuse me?
Hurled at democrats?
Oh, uh, yes.
I was, um...
The charge of activist Judge, especially with regards to...
Um...
My goodness, I forgot what I was, uh, saying.
Choice is endangered.
Oh, yes, choice.
It is.
Could you give me a minute?
Thank you for the Sarah Palin biography.
Oh, I, uh, I thought you'd like that.
The chapter where she brings big oil to heel.
Just gripping.
I bought a, uh... a Hillary bio for 50 cents on eBay.
So you're, uh...
Will says he wants you on the Bianca Price murder?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm, uh...
I'm in town testifying on another case.
Good.
Well, I...
I just wanted to say hello.
Hello.
You betcha.
Uh, you know my rules.
If, uh... if I find out the client's guilty, I quit.
Yup.
I like your rules.
Even more, I like your fees.
Well, th...
Yeah?
I thought I'd sit in.
Miss Lockhart.
Mr. McVeigh.
So, the problem is, the mom fired her previous lawyers because they wanted to plead this out.
So they lined up Jim Crosby as a ballistics expert.
Well, I agreed to meet with you.
You did.
Thanks.
And I agreed to look over the evidence, give you a bid.
Which is?
I'm not taking this case.
She's guilty.
Sorry.
I can give you some names of people who will say differently, but I wouldn't go with Crosby.
He's not convincing enough.
Um, you're positive?
She's guilty?
Given the evidence, yes.
If I were you, I'd plead out.
Good luck.
The jury needs to be told a story.
The prosecution's story is simple:
Bianca shot her best friend out of jealousy after a threesome.
Our story needs to be just as simple:
Bianca didn't shoot Heather.
Yes, it was Bianca's gun, but her mother had given it her for protection.
What we need to tell the jury is who else had access to Bianca's gun?
Joshua Mundy...
See any difference?
He was with the girls for the threesome, who shot Heather while Bianca was in the bathroom.
No.
Why?
Regarding the witness prep, Cary, Alicia, we're gonna have to delay on the ballistics expert.
- Why?
- We lost him.
We're shopping.
Okay, that's everything.
We got court in one hour, so let's go.
Will?
What's up?
This cell phone photo on Jenny Bauer's student page, it's different than the one she gave to the police.
There.
On this one, that guy's foot is on the rug, and on this one it's not.
She took another picture?
Only a split second between both shots.
It's on video.
Cell phone video.
Find it.
I'll get that for you.
Thanks.
I don't know if we're gonna put Bianca on the stand yet, but if we do, are you all right questioning her?
I'm... yes.
But I think Cary would do a better job.
Why?
They seem to have bonded.
15 years of doing this and I still can never tell who's innocent and who's guilty.
Everybody's a mystery from the outside, including Bianca.
We still haven't had our dinner.
I know.
You worried about Peter?
I'm worried about everything.
I'm not.
All right, all right...
All right!
Everybody, let's talk one at a time, please.
Marisol.
Of course he was scuzzy.
I don't want to marry him.
I just believe him.
It was Heather's idea.
- Heather Cross, the victim?
-Yeah.
She's never done a three-way before on zolpidem, and she wanted to.
- This was the night before spring break.
- Yeah-huh.
She came to me downstairs, and she was, like, um...
Do you want me to quote?
'Cause if I quote, I have to use that word.
Oh, no, you don't, Mr. Mundy, not in my court.
When you feel so inclined, you are welcome to use the word "fluff."
And Judy... delicate flower that she is... will translate it into its proper form.
Yes, Judy?
Okay.
So, um... there was, like...
"Do you want to go... fluff upstairs with Bianca on zolpidem?"
And I was, like... it was something she read in the whole Tiger Woods thing... zolpidem sex, you know?
Relaxed and crazy.
And I was, like, you know?
No, I don't know, Mr. Mundy.
You'll have to use your words.
I was, like, "sure."
I mean, um... "fluff, yeah."
Oh, the joy my life is.
Have you got that, Judy?
And you and Bianca had been dating?
Yeah.
And she was always kinda freaking out about women, so I was surprised that she agreed to go with us.
"Freaking out"" meaning jealous?
Yes.
Then what happened?
Well, we... fluffed.
And I mean fluffed.
And, uh, I left the two of them kinda out of it in Bianca's room, and I went downstairs to grab a brew.
And that's when we heard the shot.
And I raced upstairs, and I found Heather on the floor, you know, like, really red with blood and the gun on the floor.
Oh, that's right.
You're here on another case.
That's right.
We're ready.
You want to watch?
Oh, well, I...
I would, but I'm late.
Dinner?
Tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m., the Westin.
I, uh, uh, o... okay.
So, you'd been dating Bianca for a while?
Uh, a little while, yeah.
A little while, as in two dates?
Yeah, I guess.
And by "dates," we mean you slept with her twice?
Yeah.
You have that effect on women?
They get jealous after two dates?
Objection.
Argumentative.
Sustained, regrettably.
Now about this zolpidem that Heather and Bianca took, you took it, too?
Yeah.
And you know zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic?
What?
You can hallucinate on it.
You might also get diarrhea.
Well, I...
I didn't get diarrhea.
Good.
I'm so glad.
But did you hallucinate?
No.
It's also a drug that can cause memory loss.
Did you know that?
No.
In fact, let's do an experiment.
Objection.
You know I like experiments, Mr. Brody.
Overruled.
What color panties was Bianca wearing that night?
What color?
Uh...
White.
Well, that is a very good guess, Mr. Mundy, given that 85% of the panties sold in the U.S. are white.
And yet you're wrong.
They were black.
See?
That was silly.
Men don't remember things like that.
The color of a woman's panties?
Are you kidding me?
Not at that moment.
And you're telling me she's having sex with her boyfriend, another girl, and she's not jealous?
Well, actually, that was a stretch for me.
I mean, she only slept with the guy twice.
That doesn't make him a boyfriend.
So are you changing sides?
Now you're not guilty?
No.
I don't know.
I just...
The motive seemed ridiculous.
College today... a threesome doesn't mean anything.
I'm getting old.
I'm going back to college.
All right.
I think we should take another vote with our hands.
All those in favor of not guilty?
Seven to five.
Now we're getting somewhere.
I want to know how those voting not guilty can explain the picture.
What I don't understand, Miss Bauer, is I looked at your student page, and there's a different shot.
See, this one's from an earlier frame, and this one's from a later one...
From your cell phone video.
Are you with the cops?
Well, I've been assigned to investigate.
I erased it.
The video?
I don't believe you.
Anyone who brags about helping the police on their student page isn't gonna erase anything.
Look, I wasn't trying to hide anything from the police.
I know you weren't.
It's just I'd never done it before.
Done what?
Okay, Tim,
I do this for you...
You do this for me.
I was drunk.
We were just sexting.
If my parents saw this...
It's okay.
We don't need to tell them.
Josh went up before the gunshot.
What?
Josh went up before the gunshot.
He said he went up afterwards.
Oh, my God!
We need to get out of here.
Who's Josh talking to?
Who's that?
I've seen him at the gym.
Josh is always hanging out with him.
I think he's on the coaching staff or something.
This guy.
Who is he?
Oh, Ernie Suarez, assistant to the athletic director.
Does he have a locker here...
Ernie?
Yeah, a coach locker, but he hasn't cleared it out yet.
It's right there.
You got the keys?
Um, don't you need a warrant or something?
Yeah, if I were a cop.
I can get bolt cutters in here, but it'd be easier if you just opened it.
So you're not a cop?
No.
- And you're not with campus police?
- Mm-mm.
So who are you?
Kalinda.
Whoa.
Someone's been busy.
Campus police checked the serial number on the computers.
They're from a series of 30 campus burglaries
- over the last year.
- Good.
So the narrative is this:
Josh killed Heather after she discovered him burglarizing her room.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I'm gonna go catch a ride with campus police when they go check Josh's room for more stolen goods.
Good.
Is that our ballistics expert?
We'll see.
I'm interviewing him now.
God help us.
- What's going on?
- What?
Is going on?
Will doesn't even look at you anymore.
He does.
You been a bad girl?
Going now.
In other news,
Sarah Palin spoke to party members in Texas as part of her nationwide tour.
We need a commander in chief, not a professor of law standing at the lectern.
America is ready...
So, professor, you're saying this is consistent with the prosecution witness, Josh Mundy, firing the weapon that killed the victim?
Yes.
This is... yes, I am.
Even without evidence of gunshot residue on his hands?
Yes, that's right.
Could you explain?
Well, yes, I, um...
Uh, let's see, uh...
Here we go.
So the path of the bullet, um...
Darn it.
The gun was at chest level, held by someone as tall as the accused, and was shot from three feet away.
The defense ballistic expert...
- when he finally got his laser pointer working...
- Objection.
Withdrawn.
He argued that the gunshot residue found on Bianca Price's hands could have come from her contact with the victim.
Does that seem likely to you?
No.
I don't know.
Two experts say the exact opposite thing, and they're both 100% certain.
So what do we do with that?
There was this CSI:
New York, where the gun residue was transferred from one person to another.
They say it happens all the time.
But that's TV.
- Yeah, but I've heard it some other place.
- Me, too.
So it's not impossible.
It's also weird how little there is, you know, physical evidence.
There's the GSR.
Yeah, but what about the forensic stuff?
The DNA?
So, wait, you two are changing your minds?
So, let's take another vote.
All those in favor of not guilty.
Okay, six to six.
Yeah, but it's a different six, so that's progress.
Campus police.
Coming in.
All right, go ahead, check it out.
Anything?
Is your plan just to follow me?
Yep.
It's the only way I can get more from you than you from me.
What's up?
Josh finishes his threesome, goes downstairs to get a beer in his shirtsleeves.
Where did you get this?
Josh heads back upstairs.
Bianca in the bathroom hears the gunshot.
Everybody runs up and seconds later, as if by magic,
Josh in his leather jacket.
Mm-hmm.
He's cold.
He puts on a jacket, it happens.
Or he uses it to cover the gunshot residue off his hands.
Are you writing fiction these days?
There's only one way to find out.
Check that for gunshot residue.
Where would I go?
What do you mean?
What prison?
Dwight correctional center.
Is that big?
I don't know.
- We've got a really good case.
- I know.
Just the people at school, they don't visit.
If my roommate were in prison, I guess I wouldn't either.
I don't know.
45 years.
That's a worst-case scenario.
Would you visit me?
Yes.
Thank you.
I'm being stupid.
No.
No, you're not being stupid.
This silently stoic thing... that's all just a pose, right?
When you get home, you start spouting Proust?
Yep.
Yep.
Well, to cowboys.
Who knew I loved cowboys?
Maybe it's in our DNA.
Part of being American.
You don't need to talk like that.
I do need to talk like that, because that's how I talk.
You know, there's a selfishness to the silence of the cowboy... forcing everybody else to carry the weight of the conversation.
Whew, what am I doing?
No, I mean, really, what am I doing?
You're having dinner.
I mean, you like Sarah Palin, and I...
I...
I think she's the devil incarnate.
Yep.
And choice...
I mean, how can you be for back alley abortions?
The murder of 1.2...
Don't... don't talk.
Stoically silent?
I can't.
I can't, I'm sorry.
I want to, but I...
I can't.
You have to go?
I want to stay, but three generations of Democratic ancestors are screaming out in protest.
That's a lot of generations.
I hope it's good.
We're struggling here.
Potentially good.
They found gunshot residue on Josh's jacket.
His... where are you?
Police station.
Listen, they found something else on it, too...
Heather's blood.
They're interrogating Josh now.
Okay, I'll have to get a continuance.
You may not have to.
The cops are all over this.
Look, I'm outside the interrogation room.
Phone me when you get something.
I'll call the troops, we'll line up the witnesses.
A different ballistics expert.
Ahead of you.
What?
Malt ball?
What happened, Burton?
Mmm.
Well, he did burglarize those dorm rooms.
He was actually in league with Heather.
They were planning to Rob your client.
Makes sense.
Trying to kill his cohort in crime.
And the lab confirms that is GSR on the jacket and Heather's blood.
Okay...
I'm not seeing how this is bad yet.
Well, it's not... for me.
The blood and the GSR were on the inside lining of the jacket.
So he wrapped it around his shooting hand.
Josh said the jacket was on the floor of the bedroom.
He heard the shot, got into the room, grabbed the jacket from between Bianca and Heather, put it on and wore it home.
Because he's guilty.
Yes... of burglary.
I'm not an advocate here, Kalinda.
I don't lie to make things better for a client.
I just look at the facts.
And the facts are against you.
Right.
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, sorry, Alicia.
It's late, I know.
No, no, no, no, I'm up.
Look, we ran into a problem with the narrative.
I think we may need to put Bianca on the stand.
I thought Kalinda had something.
It didn't pan out.
Do you think you'll be able to handle questioning her?
Yes.
We're in a weird place, I know.
It's okay.
No.
I don't like being in a weird place.
I know.
Me neither.
When I look at you during the day,
I want to know what you're thinking.
Sometimes I don't even know what I'm thinking.
Will...
Yeah?
If it had been differently... at Georgetown, if... if it had been us and not Peter, we would have lasted a week.
No, we wouldn't have.
We would have.
It's romantic because it didn't happen.
If it had happened, it would have just...
Been life.
Will don't say that, please.
I don't understand.
9mm autoshot six.
They don't make them anymore 'cause they have a hair trigger.
The slightest pressure fires the mechanism.
An accidental firing?
Yeah, but not the one that you'd expect.
The prosecution was correct.
The shot came from three feet away.
The weapon was in the drawer of your client's bureau.
Heather was a thief, and when Bianca was in the bathroom,
Heather checked the drawer for valuables, money.
Oh, my God.
She checked the drawer with the weapon...
Reached in to take it, and...
You're kidding.
The shot was fired from three feet away, but vertically, not horizontally.
And it was accidentally fired by Heather.
There's no service in here.
And once it was fired, the gun fell to the floor.
The problem was there was no blood or gunshot residue below the impact.
That's why I didn't see it.
- He took his jacket.
- That's right.
Mr. Mundy took his leather jacket from the floor, and that had the blood and the GSR on it.
You'll testify to this?
Of course.
Usual fee.
The problem is, it's not a good story.
It's just a freak accident.
There are no villains.
But if it's true...
But it doesn't sound true.
The prosecution's story sounds like the truth... there's a villain:
Bianca, there's a motive: jealousy.
This story just says there's no rhyme or reason.
Everything's random.
Well, we're not trying to teach a lesson.
- Just win a verdict.
- There's another problem.
We've already set our story that Josh did it.
Even our own ballistics expert supported that.
Right.
We'd have to contradict our own ballistics expert.
Well, there's an another way to settle this:
Ask the client.
So that's what happened?
That's what our ballistics expert said happened.
So, I don't know.
Do we put this new evidence on the stand or not?
Which is smarter?
Well, that's up for discussion.
Our worry is we tried one defense with the jury, and now if we try another, we might do two things:
Undercut our credibility and hurt our chances if the jury was believing our first defense, that Josh did it.
So what should I do?
You go with the truth.
The truth has the advantage of being true, and on some level, the truth is always more believable.
Then that's what we go with, the truth.
And you believe the gunshot was self-inflicted?
Well, I don't believe.
The science points there.
The gunshot was accidentally self-inflicted.
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.
No problem.
As you said, Mr. McVeigh, you originally didn't want to testify in this case?
- Yes.
I thought Miss Price was guilty.
- Right.
Then two days ago you had an epiphany?
Well, if by epiphany you mean a new piece of evidence... this jacket with bloodstain and GSR... then yes, I did have that.
A change of heart?
Not my choice of words, but I won't object to 'em.
You're staying at the Westin while you testify in another case?
Yes.
This is a hotel where many prosecutors house their witnesses?
Yes, I believe that's true.
It's a hotel where several prosecutors observed you meeting with another lawyer.
Is that a question?
No.
Here's the question:
Two nights ago before you magically changed your mind about this case, did you have dinner with a partner from the law firm, Stern, Lockhart Gardner?
- Yes.
- Objection!
The question's been answered, Mr. Gardner.
Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry, but it was answered too quickly.
Well let me overrule just as quickly.
And after this dinner, the partner in question,
Diane Lockhart, joined you in your hotel room?
Yes.
And did you have sexual relations?
Objection, Your Honor!
How is this relevant?
Well, I would imagine that Mr. Brody would say that the witness's testimony was bought these alleged sexual relations, isn't that correct, Mr. Brody?
It is, Your Honor.
Well, Mr. Brody, I will sustain.
Mr. Gardner's objections, but I don't think you'll mind much because you just threw a stink bomb into the lap of the jury, and now you're running for cover.
Your Honor, this is an instance...
And, Mr. Gardner, yes, I see the outrage on your face, which I might be more moved by if you hadn't done the exact same thing with Detective Burton's testimony.
- Excuse me, Your Honor, with all dues respect...
- Please, Your Honor...
No, no, no.
This one we're calling a draw, gentlemen.
You have both been playing fast and loose with implications, not facts, so we're gonna try and let justice take care of itself.
- You have any more questions, Mr. Brody?
- No, Your Honor, but we do request a limiting instruction.
Members of the jury, in weighing.
Mr. McVeigh's testimony, you may consider any potential bias in assessing the weight you want to give to what he had to say.
You know, I think it's almost medieval.
They toss us in here, they lock the door, they throw a lot of contradictory evidence at us, and then they expect us to come up with a fair decision.
I mean, come on.
So...
Shall we take another vote?
I am finished with this conversation.
You're in my office.
You don't have the courtesy...
You don't understand what you did to this firm.
Okay, I'm getting out of here.
Did it even occur to you to tell me?
No, it didn't.
I was under the mistaken impression
- that it was my life.
- It's your life when it doesn't impact our clients.
It didn't impact our clients.
Diane, the jury ate it up.
It was sex.
It wasn't GSR or ballistics, it was sex.
I'm going home.
If you had just told me.
If you had just given me a sign!
- Come on.
- Come on.
Don't be a hypocrite.
A hypocrite?
How am I a hypocrite?
Alicia.
That's supposed to what, make me quake, make me humble?
Make you honest.
There's nothing going on with Alicia.
That's not true.
It is true.
Will...
I have two eyes.
Then use them.
Watch me.
Watch us.
There's nothing going on with Alicia.
Turn out the lights.
Prosecution's come in with a last-minute offer:
second-degree murder, ten years.
We don't have a lot of time.
When the verdict comes in, the offer goes away.
You'd be 34 years old, baby.
You'd still... you'd still have a life.
But if they find you guilty... 45 years, no parole.
2055.
I...
I...
What do you think?
I think you didn't do it... and the jury will see that.
Really?
Yes.
You only need one juror.
Yes, but if you're wrong, you'll go back to work, and I watch my daught...
Oh, my God, I can't do this.
I know.
Can you give us a minute?
Mom...
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Listen, listen, they were just arguing the opposite!
Which they're allowed to.
They're the defense.
But two ballistic experts, one saying one thing,
- the other saying...
- They're the defense.
The whole point is to poke holes in the prosecution's case.
Yes, but this ballistics expert said two days ago he thought one thing, now he's thinking another...
Right!
And what if in three days more he thinks something else?
Hey, doc, you look depleted.
I guess I am.
I don't know.
I sit here listening to everybody talk, and I just feel like we weren't given enough information.
So what do we do?
Do you have reasonable doubt?
I don't know.
I just have...
Reasonable ignorance.
Kalinda, we've got a problem.
The bailiff's warning that the verdict's coming in.
Okay.
Bianca and her mother want to talk to us.
Oh, no.
Yep.
Where's Cary?
We need Cary.
Why?
She likes him.
Maybe he can talk to her.
Okay.
We're unanimous.
- Oh!
- Yes!
Finally.
Good job.
Democracy in action.
All for $15 a day.
I bet a lot of jurors trade numbers and say they'll stay in touch, but I bet nobody does.
Why don't we just save time and not trade numbers?
Hello.
Hi.
Hello, Judge.
I thought I'd just join you in here and thank you for your service.
Unfortunately, I now need to excuse you and thank you for your service.
- What did we do?
- Nothing.
You did your job well.
This happens sometimes, and there's no way to prepare for it.
The prosecution and defense have agreed to a plea bargain just seconds ago.
You're kidding me?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not.
This happens sometimes when one side or the other worries about the outcome.
So again, thank you.
I hope this doesn't diminish your enthusiasm for the court system because in another year you're gonna get another summons.
So what happened?
What was the plea bargain?
Oh.
Miss Price agreed to a charge of second-degree murder.
Ten years.
Thanks again.
An hour ago, I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
But I do admit to a failure of judgment in my dealings with these women.
I've never abused my office for sexual favors.
Give us time to heal and rebuild their trust.
Mom, breakfast!
Oh, hey, congratulations.
That's great.
Your husband, looks like he could get out of prison.
- Looks like it.
- Early Show had a story on it.
- Stuff on you too.
Catch it?
- No, I missed it.
Yeah, I caught it online.
I could send you the link.
- That's okay.
- No, no, no.
It's easy.
Litigation wants me on this new class action.
That's where I'm headed.
What about you?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, in here I guess.
When did you say this was?
May 15th.
Four months ago.
Do you have anything with the date?
A parking receipt.
Had you ever met Mr. McKeon before?
No.
I'd seen his family on the news.
I heard about their hotels and stuff, but that's about it.
Well, the problem here, Christy, is that any civil suit could be seen as opportunistic.
Because of their money?
- Yes.
I'm sorry, but I didn't choose my rapist.
This kid doesn't know what she's in for, taking on McKeon.
- Alicia, if you don't mind, we need to...
- It's all right.
Stay.
I don't know about this.
It's a criminal case, not a civil one.
Except the new state's attorney rejected the charges.
Yeah, because it's got Duke lacrosse written all over it.
- Oh, come on.
- Put your politics aside, Diane.
You're Glenn Childs, you get this dropped in your lap, a stripper at a bachelor party accusing the son of the most powerful family in Chicago of rape, and you don't think it's Duke lacrosse 2?
He's worried about the McKeon family money.
He's worried about their campaign contributions.
Well, I'm worried that we're overextended.
How many Sheffrin-Marks depos do we have left?
- Two-ten.
- We need to keep our eye on the ball.
And Christy is just gonna look like she's trying to make some quick cash.
Do you believe her?
I believe a lot of things I can't prove.
All right, here's what I think.
I know the McKeon family lawyer.
- Ericcson?
- Right, William Ericcson.
That's just what we need, two Wills.
McKeon's are gonna keep this out of the press.
So my guess is, they throw her some cash.
Maybe 50 grand or so to keep her quiet.
Yeah.
William Ericcson's office.
- Mr. Ericcson, please.
May I tell him who's calling?
Tell him it's the other Will.
I want you to be at this lunch.
Don't say anything, just listen and look serious.
I can do that.
- How you holding up here?
- I'm holding up.
Oh, yeah.
How do you know her?
- Who?
- Christy?
I don't.
Then why did she ask for you to be on the case?
I don't know.
Ericcson here.
Will.
Will.
I think you know why I'm calling.
Two months ago Peter Florrick was sentenced to ten years for bribery and corruption.
Today was the first step toward his release.
He was known in Chicago simply as The Hammer.
He jailed cop killers, CEO's, corrupt politicians, until The Hammer got hammered.
An hour ago I resigned as state's attorney of Cook County.
Within weeks,
Chicago's incorruptible state's attorney found himself with all the trappings of a modern American scandal.
A rival with an eye on his job, an embarrassed wife, a blushing call girl, and an R-rated sex tape.
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God, please, you are...
- Hey, ever heard the whole thing?
- No.
You're the only one who hasn't.
Everything I have on McKeon.
What?
I beat you three sets to two.
Oh, come on.
You don't even believe that.
This is driving me crazy.
How do I know you?
- Me?
- Minor, Parsons Layton?
Alicia's actually our newest junior associate, one month in.
Will Ericcson, Alicia Florrick.
It's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
- You too.
- I'm rooting for your husband.
I know he has a lot of enemies in this town, but I always root for the underdog.
No, no, just ignore him.
The only reason someone's forced out of public office in America these days is sex.
So let's talk about Lloyd McKeon.
So sad, really.
I remember when you had a respectable firm, Will.
One that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these.
And what charges might those be, Will?
I haven't said anything yet.
Do you think you're the first firm she's shopping this lawsuit to?
There's nothing there.
Even the new state's attorney thinks there's nothing there.
And yet I got you to a settlement lunch on a half-hour's notice.
Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage?
- You wanna know what I would say?
- I would.
I would say you're trying to change the subject from rape.
Well, I would agree that as offensive and misguided as these charges are, the optics aren't exactly in our favor, so we're willing to make an offer.
It's non-negotiable.
You have till end of business day.
McKeon did it.
Under 100 thou, I would have said no.
- Over 100 thou...
- How about well over?
If you don't mind my asking, Miss Barbosa, why did you request me?
I saw you on TV.
I thought you'd understand what it's like to be misunderstood.
Ladies.
Sorry about that.
McKeon's lawyers made a financial offer that Diane and I actually agree on.
A first.
It's a cash settlement, $450,000.
You're kidding?
We don't have to go to court?
He just offered that?
You'll have to sign a confidentiality agreement.
Both parties free each other of liability and agree not to speak to anyone.
- What?
It's standard in civil agreements.
I want everybody to know he settled.
Can't we tell the police?
Not if we sign a confidentiality agreement.
McKeon could withdraw the award and sue you for defamation.
- What do you think?
- I think under the circum...
I think you're looking for justice, Christy.
And sometimes justice comes in a form we don't expect.
If you take this money, the settlement will be known to the two people that matter most:
You and him.
I'm sorry, no.
He'll know how much it costs to rape somebody and get away with it.
That's all.
This is about him admitting that he did this to me.
She's right.
Okay, Ericcson, how flexible are you on confidentiality?
Exclude new criminal discovery.
Oh, come on.
This isn't...
You wanna go to court, is that it?
Take it as far as pre-trial?
He doesn't wanna go to trial.
Look, Ericcson, you wanna make McKeon The Bachelor Party Rapist, be my...
That's how you wanna play it?
We turned down a half a million bucks.
Feels good, doesn't it?
Looks like we got a case.
You have to size these things up pretty quickly.
Twelve clients.
Stockbroker types.
No one out of control.
It was easy.
They paid $400 for a 90-minute two-girl fantasy strip.
Two-girl?
Who's the other girl?
Maura.
I don't remember her last name.
That was the only time she...
Sorry.
She insists on being here during all of this.
It's a nightmare.
And McKeon, how'd you meet him?
The groom?
He offered me another $100 for a private lap dance.
When I got in the bedroom, he locked the door.
Then he grabbed me.
I tried to get the Mace from my bag.
I tried to shout.
Did you tell anyone afterwards?
Maura, and our driver, Grant.
He suggested she drive me to the hospital for the rape exam.
And the service, Worldwide Elite, how long did you work for them?
- Two years.
- And what else did you do there?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what else did you do there?
For a year, I was an escort.
Didn't you think that might be important to tell us?
I haven't gone on a call in a year.
I was in an abusive relationship.
I needed the money to move out.
When I moved, I stopped working.
But still stripped.
So, what's your point?
A call girl can't get raped?
Yeah, that's my point, thanks.
Look, she lied to us.
Why believe her now?
She walked away from half a million dollars.
And when did she ever lie to us?
The more you bond, the less helpful you are.
Your stripper was hooking.
Why is she my stripper when she does something bad?
Okay, so the point is to prepare for trial so we don't actually have to go to trial.
- Cary, right?
- Yes, sir.
Nice suit.
I got a job for you.
I need you take Alicia's Sheffrin-Marks depos for the week.
- All right, I'm on it.
This is settlement poker.
No one wants to go to trial, but the person who plays the better hand makes the better deal.
So get me some good cards.
And so your first thought is to come to the state's attorney's office.
I just need one thing.
- And why would I help you with that?
- Because you like me.
- That still works with people?
Mm.
Like a charm.
You never should have quit.
I didn't quit.
I was fired.
Come on, you ran a solid rape investigation.
You should be dying to slip us the witness interviews.
Leah, could you come outside for a second?
And you're telling me your husband had nothing to do with this?
Mr. Childs, my law firm is bringing on a civil action, that's all.
To embarrass my office, make it look like I don't care about a rape victim.
A happy coincidence?
I understand the need to blame someone for your husband's downfall.
But I didn't release that sex tape to hurt you or your family.
I have kids too.
You should know, I was holding back.
I had more to release about your husband.
A lot more.
Disturbing things.
But out of compassion, I held back.
Mr. Childs, if you have something to show me, just do it, okay?
Because the one thing I don't have time for these days is empty threats.
You want something on your stripper?
Get a subpoena.
I like Christy.
She was one of my best dancers, but I have nothing else to add.
I'm sorry.
We just need contact information, Ms. Avraski, for the driver and stripper.
Dancer.
Look, I would love...
Because we'd really hate to subpoena your books and client records.
- You're East Indian?
- Yeah.
Hm.
It's very popular these days.
Contact information?
Follow me.
Why A, B, C?
Fifteen hundred an hour, 2,100, and 3,100.
What makes someone more expensive?
Is this about the rape?
No.
Regular clients, and special requests.
Requests?
No condoms.
Or being dominated.
Or role-playing.
Whatever they can't get at home.
People would really pay $3,000 an hour?
The day rate is $31,000, dawn to dawn.
So about this rape, can you get me contact information on this dancer?
Maura?
She quit right afterwards.
Left a fake number, fake address, fake social.
Happens all the time.
What about the driver?
Could you help me find him?
So, Mom, where are you anyway?
Look, I have to work late tonight.
Can you ask Grandma if she can stay until 10?
Sure.
Grandma, can you stay until 10?
Mom's working late.
No need to shout, dear.
If she has to, she has to.
Grandma can stay.
I was talking to Grandma, and she said she visited Dad this weekend, and he was saying how much he missed us.
Grandma said that?
I was thinking maybe we should be going there.
You know, visiting him.
Your dad didn't want you to see him like that, in prison.
He was...
He didn't want you to worry.
But let me ask him.
Maybe he's changed his mind, okay?
Right.
We'll talk about it when I get home tonight, okay?
All right, see you tonight.
I trust you're doing your homework.
Five minutes.
- You can corroborate Christy's story?
- Which was?
That she told you about the rape right after it happened.
Look, I like Christy, she's a good tipper, but when she drinks she doesn't know what she's talking about.
But you do.
Christy gave a lap dance, he paid, we went home.
Nobody said anything about rape.
I don't blame Christy for trying to get money out of McKeon.
But, hey, she's lying.
Is that Dad?
I don't know.
But you're thinking it too.
I'm gonna need your help in a minute.
Dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.
Should we tell Mom?
They sent them to Mom to hurt her, so I say no.
So?
I don't know, do they wanna see me?
Oh, Zach does, but Grace doesn't?
She's hurt.
She thought you were everything.
So two months in, you seem well.
I am.
There's some good guys here.
There's probably less backstabbing than the State Attorney's Office.
You look good.
It's like it agrees with you.
So here's the thing about Childs.
Everything he does is a political calculation...
Peter, no.
I don't wanna be used.
Alicia, I know you don't believe me, but Childs set me up, and if what I give you can help a rape victim, what's wrong with that?
How do you know she's a rape victim, Peter?
I didn't tell your mom.
Daniel told me.
Your appellate lawyer?
He's the one who referred Christy to you.
What's wrong?
I'm hard-pressed to think what's not wrong.
So he what?
Well, I mentioned to Daniel that you were at Stern, Lockhart, and that if he didn't have time for Christy's case that maybe you would.
I thought you'd want the work.
You thought it was a good idea to send me a hooker to represent?
No, I thought it was a good idea to send you a rape victim.
Oh, my God.
You had sex with her.
What?
You're using her first name, Peter.
You're saying Christy.
She's one of your whores.
Alicia, would you stop it?
When are you gonna stop thinking that I slept with everyone?
When are you gonna forgive me, for God's sake?
How much did you spend on Amber?
You had sex with her, what?
Ten times, 20 times?
You don't wanna know the details of what I did.
If you want me for forgive you, I need to know what I'm forgiving you for.
So at $3,000 a pop, that's what?
Sixty thousand dollars?
Did you pay her not to use a condom?
Was that extra?
Your trip to Houston.
Did you take her with you?
- You know I didn't.
- I don't know what I know.
Attention:
Today's visitation is now over.
Grace's 12th birthday party, you said...
You said you had to leave early.
Where did you go, Peter?
You answer those questions, and then we'll talk about forgiveness.
This is a pre-trial hearing, so don't worry about the driver yet.
We just need to win a few motions.
- Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
It all comes down to the rape kit.
Still no luck finding the other stripper.
All we have is a first name, Maura.
And a general description.
We need to box McKeon in.
There's only one of two ways his semen ends up that rape kit.
Consensual sex or rape.
We get him to swear there was no consensual sex.
Why would he do that?
Because he has a wife.
There you are.
How you doing?
You nervous?
No, but maybe I should be?
This is just a pre-trial hearing.
The state's attorney is trying to squash our subpoena.
We get the ground rules straight in case this thing goes to trial.
Kalinda, get in the state's attorney's office, and wait for the subpoena.
I'll do that.
What?
You don't have to.
I know.
I'll be back.
- You all right?
- Yeah, sure.
I'm fine.
Oh, my God.
This is too good.
We've got Judge Abernathy.
He's our newest judge.
He's so liberal, he makes Michael Moore look like Rush Limbaugh.
Justice may be blind, but judges sure aren't.
God, Ericcson must be pulling his hair out.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Oh, please don't stand, everybody.
Sit back down, please.
We've got a big room here, don't we?
Your Honor, given the stature of my client, Mr. McKeon, and given the fact that this pre-trial hearing has already garnered the attention of our friends in the press, we ask the court to seal the pre-trial filings and avoid a show trial.
Oh, Mr. Ericcson, I don't think we need to do all that, do we?
First Amendment issues and all?
I deny the petition with regret.
- Mr. Gardner?
- Yes, Your Honor.
We have a lot of testimony focusing on whether there was a consensual act between Mr. McKeon and my client.
But if Mr. McKeon is willing to stipulate there was a consensual sexual act, we would forego this testimony.
That's a good point.
Mr. Ericcson, how do you respond?
We would stipulate there was no sex of any kind, forced or consensual, Your Honor.
The plaintiff requests an expedited trial date, Your Honor.
A DNA sample from Mr. McKeon, DNA results from the rape kit, and the reports from the state's attorney.
They have been reluctant to furnish them.
Thank you, counselor, I will grant all four motions.
Mr. Ericcson?
I interpret from Mr. Ericcson's gesture that he acquiesces.
Well, I'll see you all back here...
Let's see, my docket is clear.
Five days?
How's that for expedited?
As a side note,
I would like to ask for a moment of silence for the recent mass killings in Darfur.
Okay, thank you.
Court adjourned.
That was a great start, huh?
You're having trouble with the driver?
You've boxed in on the rape kit.
You should settle on our terms.
Yeah, right.
See you in trial.
May 15th, four months ago.
This one seemed cool, this one...
- Hey, so you know Will?
- Twelve clients.
Stockbroker types.
You two went to school together?
That's what they were saying the other night at drinks.
Yeah.
- So that's why.
Cary, if you don't mind, I've had only a week with this.
You've got an expedited trial date to force the other side to settle and now you guys are the ones suffering.
- What are you looking for?
- TZK Industries.
I've seen it somewhere before.
What is TZK Industries?
TZK Industries.
It's a furniture supply company, supplying elegant furniture.
Why, what do you need?
Something to undercut Christy's driver.
Okay.
Oh.
It can't be that easy, can it?
What?
Now, I find this odd, Mr. Grant.
You were there, and you say there was no rape.
So either you're lying or my client's lying.
All I know is what I saw, sir.
Request permission to approach the witness.
Yes, please.
Approach.
Mr. Grant, this is a copy of your wife's W-2.
Could you read the name of your wife's employer, please?
"TZK Industries."
And TZK Industries is a company owned by the McKeon family to supply furniture to...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
Well, I think it's all right for it to be asked, Mr. Ericcson.
L...
Actually, sustained.
You sustained the objection?
I did.
Mr. Ericcson has a point.
Isn't it an amazing coincidence, Mr. Grant, that after a year of unemployment your wife got a job in June, from the McKeon family, a month after the bachelor party incident?
- No.
- And why is that, Mr. Grant?
Because my wife and I are divorced.
My wife and I have been separated for a year now.
So her getting this job has nothing to do with me.
But, sir, wouldn't you benefit, even if only in the form of lowered spousal support?
I guess, but I'm not Warren Buffet.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm sorry, I didn't see it.
Don't ever let your first chair get undercut like that again.
Good news?
I just got the rape kit results.
The state's attorney wasn't stonewalling.
They sent it out to a commercial lab and just got it back.
And?
It's not McKeon's DNA.
The rape kit came back.
It's not his sperm.
It's not McKeon's DNA.
Grant says you're lying.
- McKeon says you're lying.
- I'm not lying.
L...
- It's really not his sperm?
- Christy, we need to get the full...
- Who else did you have sex with?
- No one, I swear.
Well, you obviously had sex with someone because it isn't his sperm.
So was it a boyfriend?
Or another client?
You need to find Maura.
We can't find Maura.
You really don't remember anything that could help us find her?
We didn't talk.
She was on her cell phone the whole night until her battery ran out.
I'm sorry,
I need to get to class.
Not that I mind it, but since when did you become me?
- You didn't believe her, I did.
- Maybe she is telling the truth.
Christy said the light was flicked out, so maybe McKeon was with a friend.
So let's see if the cops tested the other party-goers.
Worth a try.
It's not just that.
What's up with your bud, Abernathy?
He's going out of his way to kill us.
Liberal judge gets on the bench, doesn't want to rule from his bias, so he bends the other way.
You said you had some pull.
He wanted to be on your Glass Ceiling committee.
Emily's List.
Are you suggesting I influence a sitting judge in some untoward fashion?
No, just in a toward one.
Come on, come to the court, let him see your sad little liberal face and contemplate a life without his friends.
Will, I'm so sorry.
Don't be, we're a team.
No apologies.
Hey.
Now what are you doing?
- Close the door.
- Come on, Zach, just let it go.
Would you shut up and look at this?
You see that?
It's called a specular highlight.
It's like a light in the eye, reflected in the eye.
See where it is?
It's to the left.
Now, look at this.
The lady's eye.
See?
The dot is to the right.
- Okay.
- They're not in the same picture.
Dad's face was Photoshopped into it.
Hello?
Zach, Grace, I'm home.
Jackie, I have a request to make.
Certainly, dear.
If you want the kids to visit Peter in prison, you talk to me.
- You don't talk to Zach.
- When did I talk to Zach?
You told him Peter was lonely.
Because he is.
Just don't go around me by talking to my kids.
Hey, Mom.
Hey.
- How was work?
- It was crappy.
I thought I'd make breakfast.
For dinner?
My goodness.
Like when you were little.
You don't have to like it.
It's for me.
So I wanna show you some pictures of where Dad's staying.
What?
I wanna make sure you know what's involved with visiting Dad in prison, okay?
I'll get that.
So, Zach, can you show me how to get to Google images on your computer?
Yeah, sure.
What is that?
Nothing.
Homework.
Mom?
Someone's here.
Hi.
Still no Maura?
DNA is definitely not from McKeon's semen.
I was going to the crime lab to see if they ever collected DNA from the other party-goers when...
You can watch a little TV.
I'll be right in.
Wanna do this later?
No, no, no.
I think I just caught my son checking out porn.
Anyway, I asked a cop friend to run the rape kit results through CODIS.
And they got a hit.
Who?
The best man?
Manny Lyons.
A rapist serving 20-to-life in an Ohio supermax.
- I don't understand.
- You're in good company.
And he's a convicted rapist.
So Christy was raped.
Apparently.
I don't get it.
Was he...?
Was he at the party?
As far as I can tell, he was in the holding cell in Columbus at the time.
This makes no sense.
We know.
This pile is everything on the Manny Lyons rape.
This pile, everything on ours.
And we can't find one thing in common.
No connection with McKeon?
No.
We checked it.
"Manny Lyons broke into an upper Arlington apartment, held a knife to the neck of a 40-year divorcee, raped her, and stole her car.
He was stopped running a traffic light ten miles away.
The divorcee identified him in a six-pack photo lineup."
What?
They do have one thing in common.
And you're the lab supervisor who worked on analysis 5795.
The rape kit in this case, professor?
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
And these are your initials, G.G., right at the bottom of the report?
Yes, those are mine.
Oh, excuse me.
This isn't 5795, this is 5794.
The Manny Lyons case.
My mistake.
Oh, I see that you ran the analysis on both cases.
Given the sequential numbering,
I imagine that you worked on one right after the other.
It appears so.
In both cases, the DNA matched the same culprit, Manny Lyons, is that correct?
- It is.
- So let...
Let me follow the logic here.
Manny Lyons, who never set foot in Chicago...
Objection.
Not in evidence.
I will sustain that.
Isn't it true, Dr. Girtzman, the only connection between Manny Lyons and Christy Barbosa is that you worked on both cases?
Objection.
Argumentative.
Mrs. Florrick, this is not a debating society.
Sustained.
Dr. Girtzman, would you say that the standard of a commercial lab is relaxed?
No.
And, Your Honor, may I answer her earlier question, personal privilege?
Oh, yeah, if you'd like.
We handle an immense backlog of untested rape kits from crime labs all across the country.
We do so with speed and professionalism.
And yet isn't it true, sir, that your lab almost lost its accreditation in 2005...
No, that was never proved.
- When you cross-contaminated two DNA samples?
This is an old slander.
That you failed to sterilize scissors, that carried the DNA from one sample to the next?
- I don't have to answer this.
- Actually, you do, sir.
Your Honor, given this testimony, we move that the rape kit be re-examined at a second genetic lab.
I think that is an understandable request, Mr. Ericcson.
Your Honor, we would stipulate that Mrs. Florrick has proven her case.
Dr. Girtzman cross-contaminated the samples.
But we argue that is the very reason they cannot be tested again.
You gotta be kidding me.
The very fact that it is agreed that the sample is now contaminated, means it can't possibly be tested with any authority.
Mr. Gardner, you argued that the rape kit was contaminated.
You can't now argue it's probative.
The plaintiff's motion for retesting is denied.
- Your Honor...
- Motion is denied.
We gotta find that other stripper.
So basically, this is a Hail Mary pass?
Look at you with the sports metaphors.
Yeah, I don't see many other options here.
Good evening, do you have a reservation?
Actually, we have a strange request.
We need to get a printout of a phone bill from four months ago.
- The name?
- McKeon.
First name?
Lloyd.
Would you like that e-mailed or a hard copy?
Hard copy.
If I could just see some ID, Mr. McKeon.
Well, actually, can I ask you a question, Rosemary?
There was a bachelor party here in May that resulted in a rape.
- Were you here then?
- I was.
Well, the only person we believe who can corroborate the rape victim's story was using a cell phone that night, and we're thinking she used the bathroom phone when her battery ran out.
We were hoping to glance at the bill just to see if there was a number she dialed.
I'll have to speak to our manager.
Nice thought.
If all else fails, try honesty.
I got 20 bucks on deception.
- Will?
- Oh, hey.
What are you doing north of the loop?
Oh, you know, seeing how the other half lives.
Alicia, this is Marlana.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
Ask for a view of the lake.
It's beautiful at night.
She thinks we're getting a room.
Yep.
Now they all think we're getting a room.
- You worried?
- You?
We could do worse.
I'm having trouble getting my manager.
If you could just wait another minute.
I owe you 20.
Okay, Christy and Maura arrived at 10:15.
Right there, 11:20.
Out of state area code.
Hello, you don't know me...
Were you the other dancer there that night, Maura?
I was, yes.
And your driver, Mr. Grant, what did he tell you after you took Christy to the hospital?
He told us that the McKeons were very rich and we should all keep our mouth shut.
And that's why you went home to Michigan?
Yes.
- I'm sorry, I was scared.
- It's okay.
And to reiterate,
Christy told you about the rape immediately afterward?
Yes, in fact, he followed her out into the parking lot.
And he said, "Don't tell anyone.
Just take the money and shut up."
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Alicia, for, you know...
Christy, I'm just curious.
Where did you meet my husband?
Your husband?
I've never met your husband.
My mistake.
All rise for Judge Abernathy.
Good afternoon.
I have given this case quite a bit of thought, as you can imagine.
You have both argued your case well, but I find myself judging in favor of the defendant.
Without a DNA match to the rape kit, we have a classic "he said, she said."
And as much as my personal sympathies lie with the plaintiff, the evidence does not warrant a favorable decision.
Judgment in favor of the defense.
Are you okay?
No.
I'm sorry.
I believe you.
There he is.
Lloyd, tell us what happened.
Do you feel you can get your good name back?
This is all I wanna say.
I have been falsely accused by a woman who wanted nothing more than a quick pay day.
But every year, there are thousands of women who are abused, and I don't think we should let this false accusation...
Mr. McKeon, you are under arrest for the rape of Christy Barbosa.
- What?
- Cuff him.
- What?
- What's going on?
McKEON:
Is this a joke?
It must be hard to lose, Mrs. Florrick.
Not if it forces you to prosecute.
I'm coming out of this with a criminal case I'll win.
You're coming out with a loss.
Nice job.
Lloyd McKeon was arrested today for rape literally seconds after he was cleared in a civil case for the identical crime.
State's Attorney Glenn Childs took credit for finding an untainted sample of DNA that will guarantee McKeon's conviction in a criminal trial.
Childs denied that McKeon's arrest...
This is yours?
Yeah.
Is he going to jail?
I think so.
Well, then, that's good.
Thanks.
Good night.
- Good night.
Does she do this for you?
Does she?
Oh, God.
Please.
You are amazing.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do to you?
Just don't stop.
What'll you give me?
What'll you give me not to stop?
Everything.
Marcus.
How are you?
It's been an hour.
I thought I'd try... one last time.
You should have stayed in San Francisco, Dr. Kogan.
By signing this consent form, you'll be donating your body to a noble cause.
You'd... have a second chance... through my research to live again.
You know what I did.
My brother and two cops are dead because of me.
I'm not lookin' for a second chance.
But I'm not the only one with a death sentence, am I?
Do you think I'm gonna kill your cancer this permanent?
I'm not worried about myself.
I'm worried about the future of the human race.
I'll sell it to you.
For what?
A kiss.
So that's what death tastes like.
You are doing something very noble.
I'm guilty.
Just cut me up until there's nothing left.
That I walk through the valley of the Shadow of Death.
I will fear no evil.
For thou art with me, thy rod and my staff, they comfort me.
Do you have any last words?
Bag Art, this is Black Hawk Six.
Missile imbound to Skynet target.
TTO 11 seconds, taken close.
- Come on, come on!
- Move, move!
- Help, go back!
- Right here!
Connor is on the ground.
This mission is a quick in-and-out.
Command teams the information on those computers should be at the highest priority.
Connor, there's no sign of the machines.
They're gone.
We too quiet.
It's almost like they were waiting for us.
What the hell's that smell, man?
Whoa!
You're seeing this?
Olson.
Objective located.
There's something else you'd have to see.
We got what we came for, Barbaros.
The clock's ticking.
Spread out, secure the perimeter.
I got a big gap over here.
Why didn't we know about this?
Sir, I think this is what Command's looking for.
I'm in their source code.
These people are being taken up north to San Francisco.
Some sort of RD project, for a new Terminator.
Send it to Command.
It's uploading, I need two minutes.
Wait, wait, wait.
Go back.
Go back!
Stop!
- T-800.
- A new Terminator.
Thought you said it would be...
It's worse.
Connor, get your nose out of that.
None of your business.
You're not leading this mission.
Alright, let's cut these sorry bastards loose.
Come on, let's go!
- Jericho, come in.
- What's that?
Come in, Jericho.
Connor, get your ass top-side.
Remind those men they need to answer me on the radio, even if they're dead.
Connor!
Connor, get those men to respond.
Olson, something's wrong up here.
Top-side, come in!
Help out enemy aircraft, I'm in pursuit.
There are human prisoners aboard there.
Get after 'em!
Data transferred to plane.
Connor, we're joining you, top--
Bravo Ten, Bravo Ten.
Do you copy?
Over.
Eagle White to Bravo Ten.
Bravo Ten, do you copy?
Over.
Bravo Ten, Bravo Ten, do you copy?
Over.
Here.
Bravo Ten, identify.
Over.
Connor!
We'll send units to the extraction point.
How many survivors are outside?
Over.
One.
Copy.
Return to base, sir?
RGB?
Negative.
Take me to Command.
Sir.
Command!
Roger, re-routing.
Request has been denied.
Command doesn't want to give up their position.
Radio cogs, over.
Are they down there?
Request has been denied, sir.
Need to go home.
It's straight from the top.
You open up that ramp!
And you tell them...
I need divers for a log-in.
Now!
This is crazy.
John Connor, prophesied leader of the Resistance.
Soldier, you put every man and woman in this sub in jeopardy with your little frogman stunt.
What the hell are you doing here?
What did we find down there?
You'll be pleased down the need-to-know basis.
Well, I need to know, because my men died down in that hole.
What did we find down there?
We found the solution, Connor, that can end this war, once and for all.
We know the machines use short-wave transmitters to communicate.
Our intel has located a hidden signal under the primary channel.
It allows for direct control over the machines.
Skynet's a machine, and like all machines, it has an off-switch.
Does it work?
Will it work?
Yes.
Have we field-tested it?
No.
Give it to me.
I'll do it.
I'll test it.
Connor, you can stay Comm unit.
Have a nice one record.
Alright.
Alright.
Leave Connor in top-side.
Prepare for lock-out.
Connor, we do this right...
The war is over.
Remount our offensive in 4 days.
Connor...
These are the codes for the signal.
Good luck.
Why four days?
A kill list was intercepted from Skynet.
It says everyone in this room will be dead by week's end.
You are number two on the list.
Well, who's number one?
I don't know.
A civilian.
Kyle.
Reese.
Barnes...
My brother...
He didn't make it, did he?
This is tape number 28.
It's Sarah Connor to my son, John.
What's most difficult for me is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to.
Should I tell you about your father?
Will it affect your decision to send him back in time to protect me, knowing that he is your father?
And he'll be younger than you, only a teenager, when you meet him.
Kyle.
Person could go crazy thinking about this.
But if you don't send Kyle, you can never be and Skynet will win the war.
You want to talk about it?
Kyle is out there somewhere alone and Skynet is hunting him.
What about the signal?
What do you think?
If it works, it's incredible.
Yeah.
- We have to be careful.
- I agree.
But we have to try.
Okay.
Alright then, start with something small, something more familiar with.
We should try to capture a Hydrobot, bring it in for testing.
Yeah.
What is it, John?
Kill Kyle Reese, reset the future.
No John Connor.
Hey!
Come with me if you want to live.
What is that?
She doesn't talk, but you need to start.
Where did you get that jacket?
The other guy didn't need it.
You see that red?
It stands for blood.
It's a symbol of the Resistance.
You're obviously not a Resistance fighter, so take it off.
Take it off!
You point a gun at someone, you better be ready to pull the trigger.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
What the hell was that thing?
A Terminator.
T-600.
What day is it?
What year?
2018.
What happened here?
Judgement Day happened.
I gotta get outta here.
You can't go on foot.
Machines will cut you down.
You need speed.
I need a car.
Look, there's some by Griffith Observatory.
- I don't know now.
- Take me.
Get down!
That was a Hunter Killer.
Thanks to you, they know we're here.
What's your name, kid?
Kyle Reese.
Come on.
We burn down the transmitters so it can't talk to any of its pals that it can still recieve.
Turn it on!
You got it?
Hold it down!
Hold a bit...
Turn the signal up.
Get me a strap.
- Holy shit.
- Could you believe it?
Just strap it tight.
The signal has to be continuous.
If there's any interruption...
Let's rig up a portable shortwave.
I need to test it on something larger in the field.
Alright.
Destroy this thing.
So where are the cars?
You don't want to go out after dark.
Hunter Killers have infrared.
Hunt better at night.
We'll all go tomorrow morning.
What is that?
Two-day old coyote.
Better than three-day old coyote.
Hey, hey!
- Grab it.
- What?
Grab it.
Magic.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
This radio work?
No.
My dad tried to fix it, but...
He could never get it to work.
Hold that.
Where is everybody?
They're gone.
So why are you still here?
'Cause we're the Resistance.
L.A. branch.
Welcome to the headquarters.
Resistant to what?
Machines.
Skynet.
Just the two of you?
Yeah.
How come you're not wearing one of these?
'Cause I haven't earned mine, yet.
I hope he's listening to this.
We've been fighting a long time, and we've all lost so very much, so many loved ones gone.
But you are not alone.
There are pockets of Resistance all around the planet.
We are at the brink...
Do you want to see a magic trick?
Hold that up.
Press the button.
If we had to finally scope when it is less than 100 meters.
We've had a lot of firepower but the T-600's are heavy, and so, their primitive design.
Who is that?
If you can help or no...
- I don't know.
- then you have one option.
Their motor cortex... is partially exposed to the back of their neck.
A knife to this area will disorient their tracking device but not for long.
Above all, stay alive.
You have no idea... how important you are and how important you will become.
The machines are advancing even faster than I told you they would.
I've seen it with my own eyes.
They were inventing new Terminators.
New ways of killing us.
Skynet is planning something big.
But the Resistance is planning something bigger.
This is John Connor.
If you're listening to this, you are the Resistance.
John Connor.
We gotta find this guy.
So...
You get it working?
- Almost.
- Good.
Look, I figure we head east, right?
We go through the desert, then we can connect with the Resistance there.
I'm heading north.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
The machines control the whole Northern Sector upto San Francisco.
That's Skynet's central.
I have to find someone.
There's a lot that you don't understand about Skynet, okay?
It's just too dangerous for us to go there.
What about the L.A. branch?
Come on, man.
We need to get out of L.A.
[ Song:
Rooster Band:
Alice in Chains ]
What is that?
Something my brother used to listen to.
Star, get out.
Don't look at me like that, Star.
Get out.
Get out!
You're leaving?
You're gonna leave us?
Ah, I get it.
Do you want to know the difference between us and the machines?
We bury our dead.
But no one is coming to bury you.
Aerostat!
- It's a scout of a Terminator.
- Go!
Drive!
The Aerostat heard the music.
Keep the steering.
I've never driven before.
Hold the wheel.
This thing is pissing me of.
Get it!
Hold on!
If the idea was to stay alive...
I'll drive.
We're seeing a lot of enemy movement in L.A.
Any of our people in the area?
No one on the ground.
Two A-10s in the air.
Williams and Mirhadi.
Send the birds down.
Guide them to a safe area.
Roger, Coyote 6-7 in console.
Ten miles to bring.
Lima-Alpha, 1-2-5-7-9-0-3.
Over.
- Copy that.
- Roger, Wild Eagle.
Final copy.
Hey, there's someone here.
Get down, now!
- Get down!
Now!
- Move!
- Drop your weapons.
- Let's see your hands!
I never thought that you guys--
- That's it, drop it!
- Move, man!
What?
Is there a problem?
Hey, we saw your Resistant sign.
The old lady put it there, not me.
What do you want?
We're looking for fuel.
The dark season's coming.
We only got enough for ourselves.
You point that gun at somebody, you better be ready to pull the trigger.
Put your guns down, everyone.
Look, we just came to find the Resistance.
That's all.
The Resistance?
What a joke.
Fighting those machines is impossible.
We keep our heads down, they ignore us.
You keep your heads down and they'll come for you eventually.
We help you and maybe they will.
These people aren't gonna help you.
Let's go.
You're not going anywhere.
Not until this one gets something to eat.
Bring me a basket.
Here you go.
Come on, help yourself!
Eat up.
Are you alright, son?
It's our food.
Our fuel.
It's not your choice to make!
- Are you okay?
- What?
Are you okay?
Star, Star!
Damn!
You brought them here!
You brought them here.
Hey!
- Stop, stop!
- Come on, wait.
- Hey!
- Go!
Go get 'em, go!
- Head for the tunnels!
- Truck!
Marcus, Marcus!
We can't just run for it.
Run!
Shoot it!
Go, go, go!
It didn't work!
Shit!
Hell, yeah!
Mototerminators!
Shoot that son of a bitch!
Marcus, turn right up here.
Hold on!
Where is the other one?
Get up here!
Come on!
Star, give me the gun.
I got it.
Yeah!
Hang on!
- Drop the ball!
- Uh, alright.
Star, go!
- Star!
- No!
Kyle!
Marcus!
Get back!
Marcus!
Marcus!
I got my eyes on two targets.
We've got two bogeys at 270º.
They've never come this deep before.
They're looking for something.
H.K. is down.
We've got an H.K. porching our six.
Come over by.
Breaking off.
Evasive maneuvers now!
Taking fire.
I'm hit.
Portside damage.
It's got a lock on you.
Break off.
Eject, Williams, eject!
Punching out.
There's your transport, headed northwest, bearing 2-8-9 towards San Francisco.
First, test the signal... and pray it works.
You okay?
Get my knife.
It's in my left boot.
What's your name?
Blair Williams.
What's yours?
Name's Marcus.
You can let me down now, Marcus.
- That thing, where'd it go?
- The transport?
Skynet.
Where the hell are you going?
After it.
Hate to break it to you but...
If you've got friends on that thing...
They're good as dead.
The same is you if you keep walking in that direction.
They've only been dead a while and I am getting used to it.
Why don't you come with me to my base?
Connor might know why.
Listen, if you've got a problem with the machines, he's definitely the guy you wanna talk to.
- How far is your base?
- It should be 1 or 2 days hike.
And it's that way.
What are you saying?
Speak English!
I was telling him...
It is not true, the part the machines killing us.
They're gonna kill us.
They're gonna kill everyone.
We are in a cattle cart, on our way to the slaughterhouse.
Calm down.
You're not helping.
The most important thing that we can do right now is stay alive.
In here and in here.
Alright?
Just stay alive.
Over there.
Find something that can burn.
We'll be at my base tomorrow.
Are you hurt?
I'm fine.
What you got there?
Just some antibiotics.
Antibiotics are hard to come by these days.
Listen, I don't have much, but... you're welcome to whatever you need.
We've been watching you.
Looking for this?
Come on, guys.
Machines are the enemy.
- We're on the same side.
- No, no.
See, I've got a couple of friends on my side.
Maybe they can carry you home... when I'm done with you.
You might want a chamber around.
Kill me, you ain't gonna win this war.
Ow!
Oh, God!
I'm a little cold.
Relax.
I just want some body heat.
You have a strong heart.
God, I love that sound.
Thank you... for saving me back there.
I don't meet a lot of good guys these days.
I'm not a good guy.
You are.
You just don't know it, yet.
Do you think people deserve a second chance?
Yeah.
I do.
This is it.
Skynet's Valley of Death.
We've never been this deep before.
We've got to be sure this thing works in their territory.
On the bigger machines.
That will bring them in.
H.K. They're coming.
Turn it up!
It works, man.
The signal works.
It's beautiful!
- Commander Ashdown.
- Connor, tell me it works.
It works.
That is affirmative.
The signal works.
Good.
The attack commences tomorrow at 0400, worldwide.
Your unit will be in support of a bombing in Skynet's central.
What is the extraction plan for the prisoners?
Extraction plan?
There is no extraction plan.
We're gonna level the place.
Negative!
I told you.
Skynet Central is filled with human prisoners.
This is war, Connor.
Leadership has its cost.
You, above all, should know that.
Ashdown, come in.
Ashdown, Connor.
Ashdown, Con...
Damn him!
Star!
Get back!
Get back!
You have to calm down, now.
I gotta get out of here!
Blair.
What?
This is us.
The mines are magnetic.
If we head due west at this point of entry, we're good.
I'll go first.
Let's go, Marcus.
I'm starving.
For thou art with me, thy rod and my staff,
- they comfort me.
- Father.
This is the beginning of something wonderful.
- The son of a bitch is here.
- What do we've got here?
He stepped on a landmine.
Start a large bore-IV.
Keep it open.
- I'm okay.
- Patient needs more morphine.
- What's his name?
- Marcus.
He's got a prosthetic limb?
What?
Okay, pulse is dead.
Let's see what we've got here.
Barnes?
The Devil's hands have been busy.
- What is it?
- It's real flesh and blood.
Though it seems to heal his off quickly.
The heart is human, but very powerful.
The brain too, but with a chip interface.
- He done enough?
- It has a hybrid nervous system.
One human cortex.
- One machine.
- What the hell would have they done?
Who built you?
My name is Marcus Wright.
You think you're human?
I am human.
No!
No!
God!
Where were you manufactured?
I was born...
August 22nd, 1975.
I know you.
I heard your voice on the radio.
- You're John Connor.
- Of course you know me.
You were sent here to kill me.
Kill the leadership.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why are you here?
Blair said you could help me find who I'm looking for.
Now let me down.
If I let you down... you'll kill everyone in this room.
Just you, Connor.
'Cause I ain't give a shit about you.
I didn't even know your name until two days ago.
No?
You and me...
We've been at war, since before either of us even existed.
You tried killing my mother, Sarah Connor.
You killed my father, Kyle Reese.
You will not kill me.
Kyle Reese is on a Transporter, heading for Skynet.
If I wanted to kill him,
I would have done him in L.A.
Where did you find that thing?
You sent Mihradi and me to provide cover for some civilians.
He was one of them.
Was there a teenage boy?
I honestly don't know.
They were taking him to a Transport.
- He was the only one left.
- Not he, Blair.
It.
"It was the only one left." Don't be naïve.
It saved my life.
Kate, what's gonna happen to him?
Disassembled.
You mean killed.
It may have information on Skynet.
I know he's not the enemy.
I've been shot at by the enemy.
That's not him.
That machine saved you only to gain access to kill all of us.
We're gonna be okay.
Don't worry.
For my brother.
No!
Connor wants to see you.
What for?
Like he's going to tell me, Barnes.
Let me see that.
You want me to tell Connor you're not coming?
No.
Watch him.
I told you everything I know, John.
Skynet is ruthless and unpredictable.
They will use the best part of you against yourself, and they will have methods I can't imagine or predict.
That I can't help you with.
And when you're unsure, which just always follow your heart, John.
I love you.
Goodbye.
There's nothing on the tapes about machines with organs.
That thing in there...
I thought I knew our enemy.
But that thing...
That makes me feel like I know nothing.
I looked in its eyes, and it believes, absolutely believes, that it is human.
It believes everything that it says, and it is telling me that Kyle Reese is in Skynet.
If that is true...
The Command is about to bomb my father and the rest of those prisoners and I cannot stop them.
Thank you.
Come in!
Wassup?
Blair says you needed me.
Get in!
Kill them!
Barnes!
What about Blair?
She made her choice.
Get down!
Let's move.
- Put some light out there!
- We're back in the minefield.
I have a plan.
- Blair, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay!
- Get your team back!
- There they are!
Run!
God--
Now what?
M-My plan stopped at the jeep.
Okay.
Do you have the shot?
I'll draw the fire.
You take out the light.
I got a target!
Behind the wall.
- Stand behind the wall!
- Go!
Down!
Keep your head down!
Keep your head down!
Go, go, go, go!
Come on!
- You alright?
- Let's get you out of here.
There they are!
On the ground!
Stay on the ground!
Report 27.
Coming straight down.
I'm going in.
- Do not move!
- Keep your eye on them.
Who's there?
Alligator, this is Scarface 5-1, we have eyes on the machine.
Contact--
Take my gun!
Check the river.
You see him?
Move!
God!
I'm going down!
Fall!
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!
They know what you are, even if you don't.
Enough!
That gun ain't gonna stop shit!
Nobody shot you in the heart, and I see that thing beating a mile a minute.
Kyle Reese...
He's in Skynet.
You do that, he's dead.
I can get you in.
How?
Look at me.
That's why I don't trust you.
I'm your only hope you have.
I need to find who did this to me.
So do you.
Connor!
Make your choice.
You kept being...
You tell me where I can find Kyle Reese.
- Yeah?
- I will.
Contact me on that.
Let me know he's still alive.
What are you?
I don't know.
Hey, he's over here.
Where is he heading?
You alright?
Any sign of him?
He's gone.
What'd you do?
I saw a man, not a machine.
How's your leg?
I'll live.
Let me go!
Connor.
Command for you.
This is Connor.
Connor, are your men ready?
Negative.
Nobody is ready.
We are not, you are not.
We must abort the attack.
The game has changed.
What are you talking about?
All our elements are past the release points.
They are in assault position.
Then delay the attack.
At least, delay the attack.
I have a chance to infiltrate Skynet and rescue those prisoners.
Give me that opportunity.
No, absolutely not.
This is not the time for a rescue mission.
What you ask for, will undermine the whole operation.
Skynet has Kyle Reese.
And that is his fate.
No, it's our fate.
I have to save him.
He is the key.
The key to the future, to the past.
Without him, we lose everything.
No!
You stay the course!
If we stay the course, we are dead!
We are all dead!
As of this moment, soldier, you are relieved to your command.
You are no longer a part of this Resistance.
I didn't catch that last statement.
Neither did I.
This is John Connor.
If you're listening to this, you are the Resistance.
Listen carefully.
If we attack tonight, our humanity is lost.
Command wants us to fight like machines, they want us to make cold, calculated decisions.
But we are not machines.
And if we behave like them, then what is the point... in winning?
Command is going to ask you to attack Skynet.
I am asking you not to.
If even one bomb drops on Skynet before sunrise, our future will be lost.
So, please.
Stand down.
Give me the time to protect our future, that all of us, are fighting for.
This is John Connor.
Thank you.
What should I tell your men when they find out you're gone?
I'll be back.
[Song:
You Could Be Mine Band:
Guns N' Roses]
I'm coming for you.
Come on, Marcus.
Okay.
Signal broadcasted with full thrift, sir.
Good.
Commence bombing of Skynet.
We have a green light for the attack.
This is Bakersfield.
That's a no-go on your last.
Out.
Eugene.
Standing down.
This is Reno.
Negative on your last.
Eugene, Reno, Bakersfield, they're all standing down.
They will not attack, unless Connor gives the order.
Kyle Reese?
Go!
Get to your transport!
Go!
Is Kyle Reese here?
Welcome home, Marcus.
We knew you'd be back.
After all, it was programmed in you.
Oh, and you executed that programming beautifully.
What am I?
You are an Infiltration Prototype.
The only one of your kind.
We resurrected you.
Advanced CyberDyne's work...
amended it.
You're dead.
Calculations confirmed the Serena code on this face isn't easiest for you to process.
It can be others if you wish.
Marcus...
What else could you be...
if not machine?
A man.
The human condition no longer applies to you.
Accept what you already know...
That you were made to serve a purpose.
To achieve what no another machine has achieved before.
To infiltrate, find a target, and then bring that target back home to us.
We've been at war since before either of us even existed.
You tried killing my mother, Sarah Connor.
You kept being...
You tell me where I can find Kyle Reese.
Yeah, I will.
Kyle Reese!
Kyle Reese!
Move!
Move!
Kyle Reese!
Get to your transport.
Kyle Reese!
You, move!
In times of desperation, people will believe what they want to believe.
And so, we gave them what they wanted to believe.
A trick, in the form of a signal, the Resistance thought would win the war.
And they were right, it will end this war.
Except that it is the Resistance that will be terminated, not Skynet.
Get the attack through Skynet's Central back online.
I want our aircraft in the sky, immediately!
Sir, sir, we got a bogey with a very large radar signature, closing in on our position.
Losenko?
We have destroyed ourselves.
Skynet tracked our signal.
We led them straight to us.
Our best machines have failed, time and again, to complete a mission.
Something was missing.
We had to think, radically.
And so we made you.
We created the perfect infiltration machine.
You, Marcus.
You did what Skynet has failed to do for so many years.
You killed John Connor.
Kyle!
Hey!
Don't fight, Marcus.
Remember what you are.
I know what I am.
I'm better this way.
You will not be given a second chance.
You cannot save John Connor.
Watch me.
We got a message from Connor!
He's in Skynet.
Needs air support.
Let's go!
Scram for the aircraft.
Star!
Star, go!
Star!
Star!
Star!
Go back!
Come on!
Come on.
Come on.
What's your name?
Kyle Reese.
Stay with me!
Back!
Get back!
Come on, Star, move!
Move!
T-800s.
There's so many of them.
Be careful!
- What are these?
- Fuel cells.
Life source for the T-800.
Nuclear.
Enough to level this place.
Cover us.
Get ready.
Run!
Star, come on!
Let's go!
Come here!
- Come on!
- Come on!
We got to get to the transport!
Where are you going?
- I gotta end this.
- No, no!
I'm not gonna leave you!
- You didn't.
- Who are you?
John Connor!
- Hang back now!
- Hey!
Hey, John Connor's in there.
Where?
- You show me there.
- Hey, hey!
What?
John Connor's in there.
Come with me!
Connor!
I need help!
Help!
Connor, it's Kyle!
Help!
You son of a bitch!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's get out of here.
John...
We can't make it back to base.
Center's down and they never say so.
Medevac, urgent.
Severe chest trauma.
Call the surgical team.
We're locked.
It's Connor.
How long?
His heart... can't take it.
He's going to be okay.
He's going to be okay, Kate.
Kyle?
Take it...
You earned it.
Kate...
Take mine.
Marcus?
Everybody deserves a second chance.
This is mine.
What is it that makes us human?
It's not something you can program.
You can't put it into a chip.
It's the strength of the human heart.
The difference between us and machines.
There is a storm on the horizon.
A time of hardship and pain.
This battle has been won, but the war against the machines raises on.
Skynet's global network remains strong, but we will not quit, until all of it is destroyed.
This is John Connor.
There is no fate, but what we make.
Pay later.
{\pos(192,220)}Pay now.
Pay later.
Pay later.
Pay later.
"Last notice."
Hey, Dad?
When you're solving quadratic equations, is it factoring or completing the square that only works when the solution's rational?
I was with you up till "solving."
Are we gonna lose the bar?
We'll be fine.
Well, I wish there was something I could do to help.
I could pay you less.
I already work for free.
How about you pay me?
The exterminators still here?
- I need to talk to them.
- Yeah, they're in the back.
What are you guys doing?
It's a miracle.
- What are you talking about?
- The statue.
She's crying.
{\pos(192,240)}Please... please back up.
{\pos(192,230)}I need you to stop pushing each other.
{\pos(192,230)}I know you've been waiting around a really long time.
I promise we'll get to everyone.
I know it's getting late.
Just be patient, all of you, and we'll get to you all.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Go ahead.
Excuse me.
Honey,
I can't believe I slept that long.
I only {\meant to }put my head down for a minute.
- Why didn't you wake me up?
- Well, you need the rest.
Okay.
Well, we need to close the bar.
Hey, I'm sorry, everybody.
Listen, I got to close up now.
Ken, some of these people been waiting over two hours.
I understand.
I thank you for your patience, everybody,
I really do, but special circumstances dictate that I close.
Thank you.
Could you please make in orderly fashion in your way to the door.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Dad we need their money.
I can't do this anymore.
I want you to go upstairs, lock the door, get ready for bed, okay?
I'll be up later.
{\pos(192,240)}Okay, boss, we're looking for Ken Gilroy... 40, owner of Gilroy's Bar and No Grill.
Also missing is the weeping statue of St. Theresa that made this place famous the past few weeks.
Remember that little bodega in Queens last year had the Jesus empanada?
But the empanada didn't have the tears.
Yeah, at least you could eat it.
Gilroy's 15-year-old daughter, Addy, she's the one who called it in.
Mother is deceased.
NYPD notified CPS.
I just told them to meet us at headquarters.
Also, the back door shows evidence of pry marks.
The register's empty, so it looks like a burglary gone wrong.
Statue's also missing.
Maybe somebody wanted their own little miracle maker.
There's a lot of desperate people out there, man. {\Yes, there are.}
You know, the first thing to go are the eyes.
I would revise that and say that the first thing to go are the observational skills.
There is a... bullet lodged there.
You want to use these?
{\pos(192,210)}
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure.
{\pos(192,210)}I'm on my way I mean I've got to
{\pos(192,230)}you know, get to work, but... {\pos(192,230)}
- Right.
- No problem.
{\pos(192,230)}Look, I'm sorry for
{\pos(192,230)}just showing up at your apartment.
{\pos(192,230)}I was affraid if I called you'd tell me not to come.
Yeah, why did you come?
I wanted to see my son.
- You signed the papers, Brian.
- I made a mistake.
{\pos(192,210)}Right.
{\pos(192,210)}I thought I was okay with giving up my rights.
{\pos(192,210)}But I'm his dad.
{\pos(192,230)}And just because we're not together
{\pos(192,230)}doesn't mean that he isn't going to need me in his life.
I'm sorry, I... {\pos(192,230)}I know this is a lot to handle.
{\pos(192,230)}Look... {\pos(192,230)}The truth is, I think... {\You know, }I think I knew this conversation was going to happen,
{\pos(192,210)}I just...
I didn't expect it to happen quite this soon.
{\pos(192,210)}So the guy who answered the door of your apartment's a little too scary to be the babysitter.
{\pos(192,210)}I'm assuming he's your boyfriend?
{\pos(192,210)}I'm going to need some time to figure this out.
You know?
{\pos(192,210)}What I can tell you is... {\pos(192,210)}whatever decision I make, I...
I think it has to be final... for all of us.
{\pos(192,210)}Right?
{\pos(192,210)}I understand.
Give Finn a kiss for me.
Sure.
I'm Special Agent Malone with the FBI.
I'm... here to assist in...
finding your father.
{\pos(192,210)}And I was just wondering if you could answer a few questions?
- Sure.
- It's... just some hot chocolate.
So... {\pos(192,210)}The last time you saw your father was last night?
{\pos(192,210)}Yeah.
I mean, I thought he'd be back soon.
He didn't even take his cell.
But then in the morning, he wasn't there.
And I saw the statue was gone.
{\pos(192,210)}Do you think something happened to him because of the statue?
{\pos(192,210)}That's what we're trying to determine.
{\pos(192,210)}
- How long has he owned the statue?
- As long as I can remember.
My mom gave it to him.
{\pos(192,210)}And then after she died, he brought it to the bar.
{\pos(192,210)}When did you notice that the statue was... crying?
{\pos(192,210)}A couple weeks ago.
{\pos(100,170)}When people heard about it, the bar got crazy.
{\pos(192,210)}And I understand that you were
{\pos(192,210)}charging to put prayers in the box?
{\pos(192,210)}I mean, my dad
{\pos(192,210)}said that since it helped people, we could ask for donations.
Anybody object to that?
Why?
We recovered a bullet from the bar.
Is there something you want to tell me?
It was... it was a couple days ago.
We'd just closed up, and I forgot to lock the back door.
That's a lot of money.
- You know, it almost broke my leg.
- Don't worry, I'll buy you a new one.
We're doing pretty good.
{\Well, }If people keep coming in like this, it's going to be okay.
And it's all thanks to St. Theresa.
I don't know why this is happening, but I appreciate it.
Nobody move!
Get behind me.
Come on!
Where's the money?
- We're closed up.
- That doesn't answer my question!
Where's the safe?
!
Just go.
Just go.
We won't call the cops.
What are you doing, man?
Back up.
Hey, no matter how bad things are, this is not the answer.
- Don't make me shoot you!
- Dad, stop!
You don't want to do this to us.
D-Don't be stupid, man!
It's just money.
And the statue saved his life.
My dad said it was a miracle.
Why didn't he call the police?
He said that if people heard about a robbery, they'd be too scared to come see the statue.
And we really need the money.
{\Look, }There's really no way for me to say this without sounding like a jerk, so...
Is there any possibility that your father could've faked the statue?
He wouldn't do that.
Is that what you think?
You know, it doesn't really matter what... doesn't really matter what I think.
Could you just excuse me for a minute?
Audrey Salke, CPS.
- Jack Malone.
- Firm grip.
I hate it when I get the dead fish.
Glad I passed the test.
With flying colors.
Is she ready?
I was kind of hoping that she didn't have to go into the system right away.
Paperwork's already moving.
And there's no one else to take her.
There's {\a lot of }questions that we need to ask her.
I was kind of hoping she could stay here.
Come on.
It's not a bad thing for the FBI to owe you one.
- How long do you want?
- How long can I get?
Logan Group Home locks its doors at 6:00.
Thank you.
The bullet from the bar was too mangled to I.D.
NYPD is looking for robberies with similar MOs.
You know, I don't get it.
{\I mean, }How can people believe that this whole crying statue thing's real?
{\You know, }Danny, that's why it's called a leap of faith.
It involves trust.
People went to the statue because it gave them hope.
{\All right, well, }If I'm a believer and somebody scams me, I'm doing something about it for sure.
Yeah, {\well, }maybe someone did.
I mean, some of these sound really desperate.
Listen to this one.
"Please, don't let my Tony join the Latin Kings."
That life took his brother.
I don't think I could survive burying another of my children.
Please... give me the strength not to drink anymore.
I know it's my last chance.
Make him propose.
Nobody could love him as much as I do.
Some jumper cables.
Or a new car.
You know, I mean, whatever you...
whatever you think is best.
I don't do drugs.
You know...
My wife, she's been sick a long, long time.
Please take her so she doesn't suffer.
And tell her not to be afraid.
And then there's the less-charitable.
"Get rid of the statue or I will burn this bar to the ground."
- God does that?
- Not since the Old Testament.
Let me take it to the lab for prints.
I called you, like, five times.
Oh, yeah.
I got...
I was...
We need to talk.
Okay.
Brian wants to be a part of Finn's life again.
And?
And...
I'm gonna have to figure out what to do.
Don't look at me like that.{\, okay?
} I already know what you think.
You don't know what I think.
And it doesn't matter what I think.
- It matters what you think.
- I don't know what I think.
- {\See, }That's {\the answer }I don't want to hear.
- {\Well, }Then don't ask me...
Excuse me.
Am I interrupting something?
- Yes!
- No!
I'll talk to you later.
Sorry.
Your timing sucks.
- {\Just }Looking for a missing person.
- {\Yeah, well, }Give me a call if you find 'em.
I'm about to interview a Luis Ochoa.
He broke into the bar last week.
Apparently, Ken caught him halfway out the door with St. Theresa in his hands.
- Why wasn't this in the initial report?
- Ken wouldn't press charges.
He said the guy worked for him.
It was all a {\big }misunderstanding.
He's a liar.
You're good at this.
Hello, Luis.
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Ever?
That's very impressive.
So breaking into a bar, that's not wrong?
How about killing the bar's owner?
Is that wrong?
Somebody killed Ken?
Very convincing.
You know, the eyes, they're good, but the mouth, we're gonna have to work on the mouth, Luis.
I did break in to get the statue, but I didn't hurt Ken.
When I told him about my son, he promised to help me.
You said your son had a fever.
He's a lot sicker than that.
He can barely breathe.
- St. Theresa will cure Jaime.
- It's a statue.
You need to take him to a hospital.
- I can't.
We're not legal.
- Then I'll take him.
Look, we gotta do something.
He could die.
You were given the miracle of St. Theresa for a reason.
{\pos(192,230)}I believe it was to save my son.
{\pos(192,230)}Come on.
{\pos(192,230)}Luis, do you have a car?
And then all of sudden your son just got better?
She saved his life.
She...?
St. Theresa?
He said a lady's voice told him to wake up.
Okay, Luis, and that night, that's the last time that you saw Ken, right?
Yes.
If he's out there with St. Theresa, he's doing good for people.
Luis, this is the address of a free clinic...
Just in case your son needs another miracle.
We got security video from a loading dock near the bar the night of the attempted robbery.
Can we get an angle on the
- on that license plate right there?
- Let's see.
- There.
- I'll run it through DMV.
Okay.
Come on, Jason, take off the mask.
Freeze it.
Blow it up.
I've got an I.D. linked to the plate.
What are the odds the Gilroys are having a family reunion this week?
Addy, this is the man who tried to rob your father's bar.
His name is John Gilroy.
Do you know him?
Yeah, they're brothers.
Were you aware of any problems between the two of them?
I don't know.
Addy, I know this is difficult, but if you know something, you're not protecting anyone by keeping it to yourself.
Ken isn't my father.
John is.
So, if John is your father, why are you living with your uncle?
{\pos(192,210)}My father was a drug addict.
{\pos(192,210)}Ken... he's raised me since I was ten.
{\pos(192,210)}He loves me and takes care of me.
Okay.
Where's your biological mom?
I don't know.
I never met her.
And when was the last time you saw John?
Five years ago.
He would drop me off at the bar when he was using again.
Ken tried to keep it from me, but it was hard not to see.
All right.
Where's the olive?
Oh, incorrect.
One more shot.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Must be...
Where is it?
Wait a second.
There it is.
You want it?
Not if it's been in my ear.
What?
No hello?
Addy, go upstairs, okay?
You're late.
I'm not a punctual guy.
You're three days late.
I am parched.
What's your problem?
My problem?
Have you ever stopped for one minute to think about what you're doing to your daughter?
No, I'm not letting you put her through it anymore.
Who are you to tell me what to do?
I'm her father.
That's not her fault.
Do the right thing.
Stay out of her life.
You can wipe that look off your face, 'cause it's only a temporary loan.
Whatever you need to tell yourself.
At first, he'd call to say hi, but really, he just wanted to ask Ken for money.
And then, after a while, he just stopped calling.
You know, some people are not really equipped to be parents.
They do the best they can.
{\Yeah.}Ken always said that my dad showed he loved me when he gave me away.
Do you know where John might be?
Well, when I lived with him, we had an apartment in Howard Beach somewhere.
Hola.
So, how did your talk with Brian go?
He wants to be a part of Finn's life.
Understandable.
I have enough moving pieces already, right?
I need another man like I need a hole in my head.
I know.
You don't have to say it.
It's not about what I need.
It's... about what my son needs.
You are absolutely right.
I'm glad I didn't have to say it.
Jack's never gonna be able to handle this, Elena.
Listen, if he can't, that's something that you need to find out.
Right.
All right.
{\pos(192,230)}You know, John's rap sheet doesn't exactly scream killer.
{\pos(192,230)}I mean, he's got a lot of busts for possession, in and out of rehab, but that's it.
Well, Ken's brother is not his only problem.
I've been going through his financials.
Now, the bank shows $40,000 a month in cash deposits coming into the bar that aren't showing up in his books.
- Any idea where it's coming from?
- Not yet.
But, you know, a bar is a cash business... perfect for money laundering.
Okay, the prints from the "Burn this bar down" note belong to this guy over here.
Tommy Nichols.
Okay, his hobbies are extortion and loan-sharking.
You got to love it.
Ken asks for a miracle.
Instead, he gets a drug addict brother and this.
Look familiar?
It's got your prints all over it, Tommy.
And people saw you going into the bar the night Ken was last seen.
Hell, yeah, I went in there.
Charging people money to see a miracle wasn't right.
Jesus himself kicked the moneylenders out of the temple.
Sometimes, you just got to ask yourself,
"What would Jesus do?"
Yeah, well, we're asking ourselves, "What did Tommy do?"
Tommy didn't do nothing.
Let's see here... 40 grand in cash deposits showed up in Ken's account the first of every month.
At the end of the month, that cash was used to buy cases of scotch
- from a company that you owned.
- Now, that's what?
That's 150 cases per week, and it's clear from the bar's inventory that they weren't all delivered, so that's what I'd call money laundering.
Well... seeing as how it was his bar, that would be on Ken, now.{\ wouldn't it?
}
Yeah, but the murder charge for killing him when he wanted to stop, that would be on you.
Whoa, hold on.
- I didn't do that.
- Then, what did you do?
Okay.
Yeah, maybe I was unhappy about the statue but it didn't go the way you think it did.
This lovely piece of plaster attracts attention.
Attention which could bring the State Liquor Authority and the IRS around, two organizations which will not exactly shine the light of forgiveness on either one of us.
{\All right, }I get it.
You'll never see her in the bar again.
- Right.
Because I'm taking her.
- Why?
- You don't believe in {\any of }this stuff.
- Untrue.
I have a firm belief that I can sell Her Holiness for some serious coin.
All right,{\ look,} we can get rid of her, but at least let me take her to some people she can help.
Holy crap.
You actually believe this thing is magic.
Please make me the next Mr. Pam Anderson.
Hey, that's not the way it works.
She gives you opportunities to change your life a chance to make things right.
I'm deeply moved.
But I got to take a leak.
When I get back, I want her wrapped up to go.
We're closed!
We're closed!
You will not be forgiven!
- Give me the statue.
- {\Okay, }It's right there.
- Just take it and leave.
- You think that I'll...
So, that's what you're going with, Tommy?
- A priest with a razor?
- That's the truth.
You're telling me that you turned your back on a potential homicide.
Who am I to interfere with God's plans?
Yeah.
I'll send it over now.
Thanks for the help.
{\pos(192,210)}Here's a sketch of Father Slasher.
{\pos(192,210)}Great.
{\pos(192,210)}So the archdiocese said they need the day
{\pos(192,210)}to talk it over with their counsel before they talk with us.
{\pos(192,210)}Okay, give them an hour, call them back.
Tell them if they don't cooperate, we {\gonna }release the story to the Post.
- Nice.
Playing hardball.
- Jack, come here.
{\I think }I have a lead on Ken's brother.
Three years ago, Ken wrote a check for $700 to a transient hotel in Howard Beach.
I love transient hotels.
They put toe tags on the pillows instead of chocolates.
What are the chances that his brother's {\still }living there?
Zero.
But there might be somebody down there that remembers where he went.
Agent Malone?
I was just about to call you.
We're making tremendous progress.
Good to hear.
Is...
Addy ready to go?
{\Well, }She's been really helpful in the investigation.
It'd be great if she could stay a {\little }longer.
CPS has rules, and I'm not gonna let the FBI break them.
Even if she has to stay in an institution?
I am not in love with the idea, but what's our option?
- She can't sleep here.
- I do.
Do you want to tell her or should I?
Did you find him?
Not yet.
How you doing?
None of this would have happened without me.
What do you mean?
I was cleaning.
I'm supposed to dust under the bottles once a week.
But I wasn't paying attention.
And I dried it off, but right away, it started crying.
So I hid it in the back.
I mean, I thought after a few days, it would dry out.
But then those guys found it, and everyone started coming to see it.
And my dad was so happy, {\I just, }I couldn't bring myself to tell him.
- Did you keep putting water on it?
- No.
I never touched it again.
And it kept weeping.
Yeah.
I should have told him.
I don't really think that would have made any difference.
Ms. Salke is here to take you somewhere where you can sleep tonight.
I'd rather stay here.
You know, I get that, but... really can't help you there.
Come on.
Listen... here's my business card.
Give that to the person in charge of where you're going.
Tell them to give me a call when you get there.
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay?
In the meantime, we'll keep looking for Ken until we figure out where he is.
I really don't like calling him Ken.
We'll keep looking for your father until we find him.
Thank you.
Okay.
- So, is Addy Gilroy off to Logan?
- Yes.
Well, it's the best of our city's facilities.
That's like saying the Hudson's the cleanest of our polluted rivers.
The archdiocese called.
The priest is not a real priest, but they know who he is.
What's his angle?
Well, he's been in and out of mental institutions in the last ten years, kicked out of two seminaries, and last year he assaulted one of the archbishop's staff.
He's waiting for me in Interrogation One.
Great.
- If he starts speaking in tongues...
- I'll let you know.
Father Shepard.
How are you doing today?
- Fine.
- Good.
So, do you know why we brought you in?
I suspect it's due to my faith.
It isn't the first time I've experienced religious persecution.
It's not easy being a true believer.
What would you know about that?
I know that for those who have felt God's touch, that they don't always fit into the... establishment's belief system.
That is painfully true.
I know, too, that if you held a razor to a bar owner's throat, that there has to be another side to that story.
So... what did you do to Ken Gilroy?
I saved him.
From what?
From godlessness.
You will not be forgiven.
Give me the statue.
Okay, okay, fine.
It's right there.
Just take it and leave.
You think that I'll let you off that easy?
After you sold your gift like a cheap whore?
Oh, please don't kill me.
My daughter depends on me.
I was {\just }trying to pay the bills.
I'm sorry.
God bestowed you with a sign of his grace, and you chose to profit from it, from fools who pray for their worthless things.
True miracles are not of the flesh.
They are of the soul.
I...
I know.
It spoke to me.
Who spoke to you?
I don't know who it was...
God or the statue,
I'm not sure... but it did tell me what I need to do to fix my life.
He speaks to me, too.
Then you understand what I need to do.
When I saw a man who had experienced a true miracle himself,
I knew my work there was done.
And after all that, you just let him walk away?
Forgiveness is a virtue.
{\Well, }We're going to have to check out your apartment, Father Shepard.
I do hope you're telling me the truth.
He's fine.
St. Theresa told me so.
Good.
Then we can stop worrying.
So we found the statue in the priest's apartment.
Fantastic.
If we were the Department of Missing Statues, we could go home.
We also followed up on the checks to the transient hotel.
The brother doesn't live there anymore, but the manager remembered his girlfriend's name.
She still in the area?
We have a probable.
Martin's tracking her down.
- Listen...
- Look, Jack.
- Just let me talk for a sec.
- Look... you go first.
- The thing about Brian and I...
- {\Okay, }I'm gonna go first.
I don't want you to let this guy back in your life but that's not my decision to make.
No, it's not.
You know, if I hadn't done a background check on him... which
I had no right to do... he would probably be in our lives anyway.
- Yes, that's true.
- So I realize that, you know... you have to do what you have to do to take care of yourself and Shorty, you know, the little guy, and... my job is to support you.
Who are you and what have you done with Jack Malone?
Well, my initial instinct was to plant four ounces of black tar heroin in his car and call the DEA.
I really want this to work out.
Yeah, so do I.
Okay.
I don't know where Ken is.
What about your boyfriend, {\you know, }the goalie for the Rangers?
I don't want to get in trouble.
Then I'd go with the truth.
- They both were here.
- When?
This morning.
I figured it was brother-to-brother business, so I stayed out of it.
I don't know what I was thinking. {\I just...} I owed this guy money and I thought,
{\"What the heck?
} "I could use a miracle, too."
You pulled the trigger.
I don't understand how you could pull the trigger.
I didn't.
The piece just went off in my hand.
The guy I bought it from
- said it was solid.
- Addy was right there.
What if you'd hurt her?
What did she say?
Nothing.
I didn't tell her it was you.
- You didn't?
- No.
When I was holding that gun and I saw her face...
She's just so grown up now, you know.
I thought, the true frigging miracle is that I'm standing here wearing this ridiculous mask so that she can't see what a dumb ass I am.
Look, Johnny, we got to stop this.
I know.
I promise I won't bother you no more.
Not for me.
It's for Addy.
She needs to know her father again someday.
I don't want the next time she sees you to be on a slab at the morgue.
So what do we do?
They both got into John's car, and I haven't seen either of them since.
You have any cats in that place of yours?
No.
Why?
You know, sometimes they rile up the drug-sniffing dogs.
Okay.
Okay.
John was supposed to carry some prescription meds across the Canadian border for this black-market pharmacist.
He got to the crossing and he saw one of those...
Mountie cops checking cars, so he dumps the pills in the woods.
How much are they worth?
$10,000.
The pharmacist sent a nasty-looking guy over to tell John that he better pay up soon or something bad was gonna happen.
I'll need the address of the pharmacist.
FBI.
Get your hands up!
I got one.
Where's Ken?
I don't know.
I thought he'd be back by now.
Okay, John.
Your friendly pharmacist already layered up with the high pressed firm.
It's no way you can {\be able to }compete with that, so why did you just cut the crap and tell me where you brother is.
- He is in Canada.
- He's in Canada?
Oh, that's great so generally anywhere about the 49th parallel.
Just outside the Lac Paul cross.
It's better.
He never should going down like this.
That's all I got.
$4,000, but I'll get the rest.
I'm not running a bank.
Then I'll sign over my bar.
I already have a business, one that he's made a lot less profitable.
I already told you, I'd go get it.
I don't trust you.
I'm not really sure why I ever trusted you.
Then I'll go.
Fine.
But if my supply is not back here by tomorrow morning,
I'll have to inform my cousin, and then you'll be a lot less helpful.
I believe he's already introduced himself.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
Addy needs you.
If something were to happen,
- she'd have nobody.
- All right, listen to me.
There was a prayer box, I put it next to the Theresa statue.
I come down to the bar one day to collect those prayers and I find one with Addy's handwriting.
You know what it said?
She prayed that you were safe, and you had somebody who loves you
and that one day... you'd come back and see her again.
Yeah.
You gotta have faith.
This will work out.
I told him where to go and he left.
And how long ago was this?
Nine hours.
He was supposed to call as soon as he got back across the border.
Okay.
Listen.
I need to know where you dropped the drugs, what kind of container they were in, everything.
All right?
Okay, you ready?
The license plate is New York State
Victor, Ocean, Frank, seven, six, Union, one.
Thanks.
{\Yeah. }I'm gonna fax you his picture right now.
Thank you.
RCMP's on the lookout.
They have the best hats.
We've notified all New York state authorities, just in case he had an accident along the way.
We got a call coming in on Addy's cell phone.
Unknown caller.
Area code 905.
905's Ontario.
Okay.
Let me take this.
Ken?
- Don't hang up.
- Where's Addy?
She's not here.
Who are you?
Special Agent Jack Malone with the FBI.
How do I know you are who you say you are?
Because your niece contacted us when you and St. Theresa went missing.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's fine.
We placed her with Social Services while we were looking for you.
Now I want you to listen to me carefully.
Do not cross the border with those pharmaceuticals.
- I was just trying to help my brother.
- He's fine.
He's okay.
We have the pharmacist in custody.
Now we're just trying to get you back.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
I think I'm losing my mind.
Yeah, you and me both.
What's going on?
{\Well, }The night my brother tried to rob me...
I was a little freaked out, so I had some drinks.
That's when everything went a little Twilight Zone.
I blame you.
First you brought nothing but good... money, the crowds.
Then it all goes south.
Then my own brother's shoving a gun in my face.
I should just call the cops.
It's the right thing to do.
What did you say?
What do you mean?
"The right thing for her"?
I heard a voice in my head.
It was clear as day.
Yeah, I think I've heard that voice.
Might I suggest that it's the alcohol speaking?
Well, maybe.
But St. Theresa was right.
If St. Theresa could come to the phone right now, she would tell you to put down the drugs and head straight for the border as fast as you can.
Do I sound like a lunatic?
Yes, but I've dealt with worse.
{\Look, }When you get to the border, contact the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Tell them to contact us, and we'll come and pick you up.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Jack Malone... miracle worker.
Amen.
{\You know, }We could sit in my office.
I have...
I have comfortable chairs in there.
I know, but then I can't see the elevator.
Yeah, I know, but, you know, I can have someone call us
- and tell us when they're here.
- I'm fine.
Agent Malone?
Do you think the statue's real?
I don't think it really matters.
You know, people got what they could out of it, and some of them even got what they thought they needed.
You must be the guy with the phone.
You must be the guy with the statue.
Thank you.
It was nothing.
Jack?
What?
Just your... your face.
What about it?
Nothing.
Go home.
Bother your boyfriend.
Who is that?
Who is that?
Should we go see?
Come on.
Oh, up.
Here it is.
Hello.
Come on in.
Remember to join us again tomorrow night with the result show of "dancing with the stars."
They are just so beautiful when they dance.
- You should dance with mommy.
- And you should be in bed.
She's right, honey.
Come on.
Dance with me.
Dance with her, daddy.
- Dip her, daddy.
- Dip me, honey.
Dip me.
- My back!
- Oh, god.
Are you okay?
It's my back.
I think I threw it out.
Here, sit down.
I'll get you some ice.
Are you really hurt?
I just didn't want to dance anymore.
But you dropped her.
I never do anything halfway, honey.
Remember that.
And I can always tell mommy.
Rememberthat.
All right, i'm back from the nursery.
I bought so much fertilizer, I think I'm on a Terrorist watchlist.
Hey, daddy, do you want to hear my paper for school?
It's called "my Hero."
Yeah, I think I do.
"My Hero is someone who is always there for me.
"I think about him when I'm happy, "and I think about him when I'm sad,
"and then I'm happy again.
He is the most important man in the world to me."
Anne, are you hearing this?
"My Hero is Zac Efron from'High School Musical.'
mine used to be Chachi.
He is so cute, and he sings and dances, and I think about him every day.
Imagine if he was walking down the street, and then I was walking down the street, and then he looked at me, and then I looked back at him like this and then we got married and adopted babies from Africa.
Honey, that's very nice.
That's a very nice paper.
Thanks, dad.
I hope you have better luck with him than your mom had with hachi.
-= 101 =- " HERO "
Sub VO : ¤Aka¤
Subs-Addicts" [Sub-way.fr]
Hey, morning, neighbors.
It smells like crap back here.
It's like the back of your house farted.
It's the fertilizer...
Mostly.
I'm hoping this isn't too much to ask, but can I leave one of my house keys with you guys?
Gee, Onno, I don't think that's such a good idea.
What?
Why?
Don't you remember the last time a neighbor gave us a house key?
It ended in disaster.
What happened?
Well, we lost their key, and they couldn't get back into their house, and they were locked out.
- They didn't have their own key?
- No, you'd think they would, right?
And they went on vacation, and the guy went swimming, and he had the key in the pocket in his bathing suit, and, you know, they call it a pocket, but they should call it a "lose-it," you know?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Excuse us just a...
What?
We'll be right...
What are you doing?
I'm covering so we don't have to take his key.
That's what you want isn't it?
You don't even like the guy.
I don't notlike him.
So, you like him?
No, no, I mean, I don't no.
I mean, I don't not...
Stop it!
It doesn't matter.
I mean, he's our neighbor.
What's the big deal if we take his key?
As soon you take a neighbor key, you're taking n all kinds of responsibilities.
It's like you're their slave.
Yes, I think that was Abraham Lincoln's big issue.
The keys.
Look...
Trading keys is what neighbors do.
Really?
We don't go around giving our keys to the neighbors.
Yes we do, but they don't give ustheirkeys because of you.
The whole neighborhood thinks you're a grumpy old man, the only defense I can give is that you're not that old.
Just...
We'll be right there.
Look, this guy doesn't know us.
Maybe he's gonna trust us with something, and then we can be friends.
And 20 years from now, we look back and laugh about this and go on a cruise with his new wife.
I want this key, Steve.
Wait a second.
Who have you been giving our keys to?
How can you do this?
How can you take the simple act of accepting a key and turn it into a 30-minute discussion?
Is there no issue too small?
- I just think that...
- Stop it!
Stop it!
You are exhausting me.
We are going to take his key, we are gonna put it in a drawer,
- we're probably gonna forget about it.
- Exactly.
We're gonna forget about it.
Then a year later gonna open a drawer and pick up a key and go
"what's this go to?" And then I'm gonna try it in every lock in the house.
We are taking... his key!
Fine.
I was just trying to save us time.
Onno, we would love to take your keys.
Love it.
Absolutely love it.
Could not be more excited.
Thank you.
You guys, you're great neighbors.
Thank you.
I almost forgot to mention, we're going away for a few days.
- I was hoping you would feed my fish.
- Sure.
'cause that's what you do when you take people's keys.
All right.
Thanks, guys.
Later, Pattersons!
- See that?
Now it begins.
- For crying out loud.
- I hate feeding fish.
- Small issue.
I know.
It's just you give them a little too much food, and then they all die.
At least it's quick, unlike this conversation which is killing me slowly.
What are you shushing me for?
The man owns a strip club.
This is a holy place we're breaking into.
We're not breaking in.
He gave me a key.
I'm here to feed the fish.
I don't know what the hell you're doing here.
I've read about guys like this, guys in the flesh trade.
They have, like, dungeons and swings and collections of swizzle sticks.
A collection of swizzle sticks?
- Yeah it's a thing you stir your drink.
- I know what it is.
What a rip-off!
This looks just like myliving room.
Of course it does.
Now, will you just go home?
Hey, you have that same book in your nightstand.
How would you know that?
Anne gave me your key.
I bring in your mail when you go on vacation.
- I'm gonna check his medicine cabinet.
- No, you're not.
Is this what you do when you take in my mail?
Mr. Propecia.
Hey, it was a free sample.
Fish are terrible pets.
They don't do anything.
They don't come when you call them.
They don't look happy when you walk in the room.
They smell like fish.
God, I hate fish.
This is all anne's fault.
- What are you doing?
- He's got a lot of'em.
You want one?
They're from havana.
Those are good.
I hear they're rolled between the thighs of cuban virgins.
I don't know about you, but that sounds sweaty to me.
Look at this.
He's got a remote but no Tv.
I will marry this guy.
It's his address book.
- So?
- So...
It's got all the numbers of all his strippers in it.
What makes you think they're strippers?
Let's see...
Bambi that could be his accountant.
Jasmine, Pocahontas.
- We should call them.
- And say what?
"How are you?"
- Really?
- That's just off the top of my head.
- Put the phone back.
- No!
I want to call a stripper.
- How old are you?
- How old are you?
- Give me the phone, Jim.
- Give me the phone!
- I'm telling your wife about this!
- You are so immature!
- Jim, the drapes are on fire!
- I'm not falling for that old trick.
Since when is there an old "drapes on fire" trick?
Help me!
Run!
I've got the address book!
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Absolutely.
So, how did this happen?
Well, we were out back, recycling plastics, like you always ask me to do.
Not just plastics.
Paper.
Yeah, and then we saw smoke coming out of onno's house.
And green clippings from the yard.
We're just borrowing this planet, people.
- Anyway, I grabbed the key.
- Thank god he had the key.
And we ran over there, and Jim was yelling, "don't go in there!
- You'll die!"
- And I said,
"yeah, but if idon't go in there, the fishwill die."
"And that's not gonna happen.
- Not on my watch."
- It was all very emotional.
So, I ran in, and I scooped the fish up in the first thing I could find.
And then I grabbed the aquarium, and I dumped it on the drapes,
- and I called 911.
- Life is so fragile.
Next time, call us first.
Civilians shouldn't go into burning buildings.
My brain knows you're right, but my heart says something different.
So, you really went into a burning house?
Daddy, you're my Hero.
Thanks, honey.
So, I guess that would make me your favorite parent.
Steve, buddy, I cannot thank you enough for saving my house.
Listen, I got a little surprise for you inside I think you're really gonna enjoy.
No, you didn't.
You brought home one of your dancers, didn't you?
Hey, I'm a married man.
My wife's right next door.
It's a French maid, isn't it?
No, no, no, I'm kidding.
I love my wife.
It's a lady cop, right?
It's even better.
Okay, I'm just gonna take one look so I can get an image and hope my wife is in the mood later.
Surprise!
Well, this is a disappointment.
The whole neighborhood wanted to honor the Hero.
Well, I wouldn't call myself a Hero.
- But it's all right if you do.
- Well, i will, because you are.
I mean, I nearly lost my house, Steve, and it's not just the house, it's the things that you can't replace the photos and the stuff from my parents and...
Charlie Tuna and Mr. Limpet.
I can't even think about it.
Just go.
Enjoy the party.
Go.
Here you go, Patterson.
I know how you love your scotch.
And you apparently do, as well.
Yes, I do.
You know what I love more?
- A Hero.
- You mean the sandwich, right?
Patterson, I know there's always been this tension between us, but let's face it...
It could all be sexual.
Not all.
Listen, I have a little something for you.
Oh, god, right from the treasure chest.
It's my spare key to my house in case I go out of town, or in case you're walking through the neighborhood late at night with... nothing to do.
Yeah, if anything ever happens to anne you've always been my backup.
I got to say, i'm a little irritated.
Everyone's treating you like a king, but I was there, too.
You threw brandy on it.
It's an accelerant.
I believe it's a liqueur.
Hey, dad, can I talk to you?
Excuse me.
This better be good, son.
Seems a little awkward for me to walk out of there on Steve Patterson day.
Hey, to celebrate, why don't we smoke a cigar and spill some liquor on the drapes?
That seems like an odd way to celebrate.
Dad, I know you started the fire.
I didn't think it was a lucky guess.
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna go back in there and blab to everybody like a little schoolgirl?
Okay, dad, let's pretend for a minute that you're older than me.
I'mnot gonna tell, because I'm sure that, eventually, youwill.
Why would I do that?
Because having people think you're some sort of Hero when you're not is gonna eat away at you.
You know, henry...
I kind of thought that that would be the case.
But, no, it isn't.
But it will.
You'll feel guilty every time you see a cigar or drapes or liquor.
Got to get rid of the guilt.
Honey, the strangest thing just happened.
I was standing by the other mothers.
Are you ready for this?
They said, "hi."
And they smiled.
And it wasn't that pity smile I normally get.
You know what, honey?
All this attention is getting to me.
I think maybe we should just leave.
What?
No.
No.
We are staying.
I have earned this.
You have earned this?
Sweetheart, please don't take this the wrong way, but for years, people have been saying bad things about you behind your back, and I have always defended you.
Okay, well, not always, 'cause let's face it...
You've pulled some real doozies.
But...
Finally, they get to see the man that I have always said you were.
You know, when they break out the champagne, let someone else do the toast.
You.
- Hey, you guys having a good time?
- Wonderful.
Yeah, pretty good.
Good.
Look, I don't want to make a big deal out of this, but I've been struggling with a way to say thanks for...
Well, you know.
Anyway, I got this timeshare in cabo.
I want you guys to use it.
No, no, no, I can't.
We can't, because I already feel too guilty about the party and everything.
No.
It's three bedrooms, ocean view, infinity pool, the works.
It's on me.
No, I wouldn't feel comfortable.
I don't even speak spanish.
Hola!
Are you out of your mind?
Of course we'll take it, and thank you.
You're welcome.
Steve, have a Cuban.
Enjoy the party.
All right, let me get that for you...
Hero.
So, daddy, I'm gonna rewrite my whole paper, and I'm gonna call it "why my dad is better than Zac Efron."
Honey, you don't have to do that.
It's gonna say that you became such a big Hero that Zac Efron wanted to meet you.
So, he came over to our house, and he said,
"i'm happy to make your acquaintance."
And then you said, "i'm happy to make your acquaintance.
And would you like to meet my daughter?"
And then I looked at him like this...
And he fell in love with me, and he moved into my room.
Hope you don't mind.
Honey, I'm sure that's exactly how that's gonna happen.
- Time for bed, sweetie.
- Night, mommy.
Good night.
- Night, daddy.
- Night, honey.
What's this for?
I have a confession to make.
I had a hard time believing your story about putting out the fire.
Some stories are hard to believe.
Yes, and that's what makes me feel so guilty about doubting you, right?
I mean, of course you would put out a fire.
You're not a monster.
Monster?
Where...
Where did that come from?
Well, you know, all I'm saying is you're a good man.
You're a Hero.
There, I said it.
You're my Hero.
I said it again.
Honey, i, I have something to tell you.
Can it wait...
Until after we've made the best love we've had in 20 years?
Well, that was fantastic.
A lot less fumbling than usual.
You are welcome.
So...
You ready for another round?
Well, sure.
I'm just gonna, you know, grab a sandwich and take a little nap, and then I'm good to go.
I love you so much.
You know, when I look at your smile right now, you look just like you did back in college.
Better.
I just feel so close to you right now.
Isn't it great that, after all this time, can still be surprised by each other?
I can't do this.
Well...
Honey...
I was just teasing you.
I know you need a 3-hour turnaround.
No, what I'm saying is I started the fire at Onno's.
You started the fire?
Not intentionally.
It was an accident.
I was just over there to feed Onno's fish, and one of his cigars just...
You started the fire?
!
Dr. Jim!
Dr. Jim did it.
He distracted me.
He wanted to call one of Onno's strippers, and I said no!
And then the drapes just burst into flames!
And then you lied to me, and then you slept with me!
You lied to me to sleep with me!
Hey, I've done that before.
How could you do such a thing?
Because you're beautiful?
Donotdo that!
Do not use my beauty against me!
Look, I'm a screw-up.
Everybody knows that.
But it didn't seem to bother you when we were dating.
And it didn't seem to bother you when we had kids.
It only bothered you when we moved into this damn neighborhood.
And then when I saw you and the neighbors and Courtney all proud of me...
I just wanted to be a Hero.
I think you have to do good deeds to be a Hero.
Well, sure, in hindsight.
Well, it's late.
We should go to bed.
Hi, daddy.
Do you think this looks like you?
Why am in a dress?
That's a cape, 'cause you're a Hero.
I really wish you'd stop calling me that, honey.
Good morning, Courtney.
Daddy, I can't wait to show my new paper to my teacher.
I bet she'll want you to come into class.
- About your paper.
- What?
I want you to change it.
- Why?
- Steve, what are you doing?
I need to set the record straight, because it's important.
So, anyway...
I really wish you'd stop looking at me like that.
You know, with love in your eyes.
'cause heroes are supposed to be honest.
Honey, what your dad is trying to say is, who would you rather have save you from a burning building?
Dad or Zac Efron?
Well, I guess dad.
Zac could get hurt.
I think your dad is a Hero, and you should keep your paper the way it is.
I'm gonna go check my e-mails now.
What was that about?
Look, what you were just about to do is very brave.
Not, you know, "putting out an actual fire" brave, but for you, really up there.
And brave guys should be heroes to their children...
And their wives.
But, you know, in the future, let's just try to be honest.
I better call Onno and cancel the condo.
We are using that condo.
- But you just said to be honest.
- Yeah, to me, not the neighbors.
Wasn't Mexico great?
I don't know.
It just seems everywhere you turn, there's needy people.
Yeah, but if you give them a peso, they'll go away.
You guys are home early.
I made popcorn.
- What are you doing?
- I brought in your mail.
You're welcome.
- Give me back my key.
- After the game.
Hey, the ultrasuede feels really good on the area.
We need a new couch.
Come on, honey.
So, who's winning?
Team Subs-Addicts
I don't want to hold him back.
I can't stand the thought of losing him.
I know.
Me neither.
I spent all this time trying to go to college.
It's seeming more and more impossible.
You are gonna have everything you are dreaming of.
The Vanderbilt thing not working out was fate.
I'm going to San Antonio with Tim.
You liked calling the cops on my dad.
That's not true.
Katie, I had no choice.
I want nothing to do with you.
Redistricting, try to open up East Dillon High...
It's never gonna happen.
No one is gonna stand by and let the Dillon Panthers get dismantled because of some dang politics!
And Panther wide receiver and quarterback
Matt Saracen will be going to the prestigious Art Institute of Chicago next year.
And Panther tailback Tim Riggins will be going to San Antonio State University.
Congratulations, Tim.
We're all so proud of you.
And Lyla Garrity, number two in her class, will be attending...
San Antonio State University next year.
That's great, Lyla.
And Tyra Collette, who's done such a great job this year as student council president...
let's give her a big hand for that!
And she is still in the process of making a decision between some real exciting possibilities for next year.
She's been wait-listed at UT!
She's gonna get in.
Mama, seriously...
Stop.
She's gonna get in!
Very exciting, very exciting.
Congratulations on all your great, hard work...
All right, here we go, listen up!
You are now officially released until August 1st.
What do you say?
Final note.
J.D.!
I want everyone to know that J.D. has been named...
Dave Campbell's High School Quarterback of the Year.
Let's give him a hand.
J.D., why don't you break 'em down?
Let's go.
Y'all have a good summer, now.
Bring it in!
One now... 2, 3!
Panther pride!
J.D.!
Way to go, 12!
Way to go!
You know that Coach Taylor's contract is up for discussion at the board meeting this Saturday.
Yes, I do.
And I want to give you the option to recuse yourself.
Why would I want to do that?
Well, Tami, he is your husband.
Yeah, he is, and...
These contract negotiations can get heated.
It might be difficult to stay objective under the current circumstances.
I actually have a lot of confidence in my ability to stay objective, and professional, and... and do my job as principal, so...
Ok.
Hey, Paul.
Is there...
Is there a question about Eric's contract for next year?
Like I said, Tami, these matters are complicated.
Right, well...
The Aveo 5 is a beautiful car.
Besides that, you got side airbags, and that's the whole reason I want...
Look, enough about the damn car, would you please!
What the hell am I doing?
You know what we're doing.
Yeah.
It's recruitment, everybody does it, I understand.
It is not recruitment.
If it were recruitment, it would be illegal.
Whatever you wanna call it, all right.
It's simply a visit.
I want you to meet the parents.
We got to get there before Smith, from Arnett Mead.
That's the whole point.
Great.
When we get there, you can do the talking, that's what you do best.
He may offer him something, we're not.
It's this right, right up here.
So I don't have to tell y'all about the tradition of Dillon Panther football.
I mean, you see what Smash Williams is doing this year over at AM.
And he's just the last player that we've had go into college.
And so many players have gone into the pros.
So Shane going to Dillon means that he's gonna probably be with the best coach...
Mr. Garrity!
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but...
I might as well just tell you.
We've already made our decision.
Shane's gonna go to Dillon High.
Right, son?
Yes, sir.
Well, that's... that's excellent.
Congratulations.
That's a good decision.
I just have one question, though.
Who's the head coach?
Well, Eric's the head coach.
It's not Wade Aikmen?
No, sir.
Wade Aikmen's been helping us out with our offense, but no...
Eric's the head coach.
When they come by last week, I sure got the impression that...
Who came by?
Wade Aikmen.
Him and that other fellow, what was his name?
McCoy.
Yeah, McCoy.
They sure made it sound like they were the ones making the decisions.

Eat that one.
I think I know why they want you to recuse yourself.
I think it's a negotiating thing, you know?
They're trying to get you to take less money, or something.
A scare tactic.
Joe McCoy, Wade Aikmen, over at the Dubuque house... acting like they're running the team?
Joe McCoy's trying to get me fired.
I don't think so.
I mean, that's, that's pretty low.
They're mad at us, but I can't believe that they would do that.
I know, baby.
Eat those, eat those!
I can.
Lorraine, you need all these dresses?
Yes, ma'am, we do.
Please, just put them in that suitcase.
I got 'em all out for that reason.
Grandma!
It's only 15 minutes away.
You don't need to bring everything.
Well, I need my dresses, though.
If you were a woman, you'd understand.
I understand you need your clothes, you just don't need all of 'em.
Right, Julie?
You understand.
I need my clothes.
She needs her clothes.
Yes, ma'am.
Thanks, Julie.
Maybe just leave some here, you know, for when you come back.
What about the magazines from the 70s?
Can we just pitch them?
No, I'm not through.
There's a recipe in there, in one of those.
I still need them.
If you'd just put them in that box, that'd be great.
Do you remember this?
Oh, my gosh!
Shelby, did you see this?
What?
Just leave it in the box.
Look at how cute it is.
Oh, my God.
Look at your hair!
Ok, 7th grade was a bad year.
No, it's cute.
Well, I want this picture, and that's why I packed it, I'm taking it.
Look, Grandma, either way, you can take the picture, but you don't have to take everything.
That's right, I don't.
But I darn sure am gonna take this picture!
Let's suppose you're at college, I wake up one morning, I have one my spells, and I can't... can't remember you... you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna look right up on my wall, and there you're gonna be, with that smile... that precious, precious boy.
That's my concern.
Just... go in?
I know, I see...
I see your point.
Well, I do see your point.
Now I do...
Hey!
Thanks for coming.
Come on in.
Hey, baby.
What's going on?
Well...
Go ahead.
We just wanted to talk to you about going to San Antonio State.
What about it?
Well, I think your dad has some concerns about the quality of the school, for you, and I frankly agree that it may not be the best fit.
I'm already going.
I mean...
I was already there, I paid the tuition, and I'm enrolled.
It's done.
Yeah, but honey, it's a party school.
It's not a party school, Dad.
It's a good school.
It's a crap-ass party school, and Tim Riggins is going there, and that's the reason you're going.
You know what, Dad?
Maybe you shouldn't have blown my college fund on tearing up a strip club!
Listen, honey.
I...
You see what I'm up against.
If you'll excuse me, please.
I do not mean to interfere in any way, but I did want you to know that at your dad's request, I called Vanderbilt.
They actually are willing to extend the decision until Monday.
If you choose to go, they would like to have you.
How're we gonna pay for it?
Well...
I thought maybe we could call your uncle Gary.
He hates you.
Well,
I'm not really fond of him either, but...
I'm the one who did this to you, and I feel like I...
I'll do anything, honey, for you to be able to go to Vanderbilt.
Even call Uncle Gary, so...
It's a big decision.
It's an important decision.
And I think Tim will understand.
How you doing?
What's up?
Doing ok?
Ginnie Warwick!
She got into Brown.
I know that.
She came to celebrate with her family and I got to serve her.
Which is pretty much the metaphor for my future.
Oh, and, you know, Vickie Savo?
She's going to Rice.
So... that's awesome.
What, now, you are going to UT.
You sound like my mother.
You are.
Well, no, I'm on the wait list, ok?
And there's nothing you can do when you're on the wait list, except wait!
Why don't you just go to UT, then?
UT?
Yeah, why don't you find the admissions officer who sent the letter, and just talk to him directly?
It's a lot better than just sitting around here and beating on my car.
Well, it's a bit desperate.
You are desperate.
What can I do for you, Eric?
Buddy Garrity and I went over to Shane Dubuque's yesterday.
That kid's an animal.
Like a water?
No.
As I understand it, you and Wade were over there last week.
Yeah, that's right.
You might be able to imagine how that makes me feel.
Hey, if we lost Shane Dubuque to Arnett Mead, we'd be dead next year.
So I figure, we need him, let's go get him.
Hey, Joe, I don't want you and Wade running around making house calls, acting like you represent this team.
I didn't see you moving aggressively on him, and I did not wanna miss that opportunity.
Joe, you do not represent this team.
I backed up a truckload of cash for this team, this year.
Without my son, there is no team.
So as far as I'm concerned, I represent this team as much as anybody else in this town.
You trying to replace me?
If you would like to continue,
I need your guarantee that, barring injury, of course, my son starts every game next season.
I also need your guarantee that Wade Aikmen calls all the plays.
Mac calls my plays.
Yeah, I know.
Joe, I don't give a damn how much money you got, and I don't care how well you think that boy of yours can throw a football.
But you're not just messing with my livelihood now, you are threatening my family.
I'm not threatening anybody.
Against my better judgment,
I'm offering you an opportunity to continue with this team.
I'm sure you know what you can do with that opportunity.
I'm pushing down on the broom!
You're not pushing hard enough.
I'm putting pressure on the broom.
You push so fast, it won't pick up the dirt!
Hi, guys.
So, what do you think?
I think it's amazing.
Really?
It looks good, doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.
I can't believe you guys actually pulled it off.
It looks great.
Good job.
So, you hungry?
Kinda.
Wanna go get something to eat, work on our schedules?
I do... bad.
But Billy and I, we're gonna head out of town to...
We gotta go pick up a hydraulic lift at auction.
It's kind of a big deal, so...
Ok.
Really, ok?
Hey, how'd it go with...
Mrs. Taylor today, your meeting?
It went fine.
Sweet.
What'd she want?
Just wanted to talk about my schedule.
Did she?
Perfect.
Mr. Garth?
Dr. Garth.
Can I help you?
Hi, I'm Tyra Collette.
I'm on the wait list.
I just...
I wanted to tell you how much... how much I appreciate being on the list, and how much I respect the process.
And I don't wanna rush it, but...
I just wanted to tell you that going to UT has been a dream of mine pretty much my entire life.
It's the dream.
And if there's anything I can do to help my chances...
Do you have your letter with you?
I do, it's... it's right here.
Thanks.
Let's see.
Miss Collette, I need you to understand, we get over 35,000 applications each year.
And we put about a thousand on the wait list.
A thousand?
So, a thousand people got that letter?
Unfortunately, yeah.
That's the way the system works.
You need to come to that meeting.
Why?
To stand up for your job.
There's nothing I could, should, or need to say at that meeting.
They can see what I've done and decide.
If they want Joe McCoy to take over this team... that's their damn funeral!
I don't think that's a good strategy.
That's because it's not a strategy.
I know.
But I'm starting to think that we're gonna need a strategy.
I can't outtalk nor outspend, that's for damn sure, Joe McCoy.
I know.
I have given everything I've got for this team.
I've still got that, I still got my pride, I'm not giving that up.
Uh-uh, honey, you're never gonna give up your pride.
But if you don't fight for this, I think we're gonna regret it.
All right, we got several good items here.
You can take a look around and see there are things you cannot buy in a store, 'cause they just would not sell 'em.
Right now, item #42 over here, we got the Lincoln arc welding machine.
We got this barber chair...
That's stupid.
Item #28, that's an owl head, which is made from a deer's rear end.
Who'll give me $25 on the owl head taxidermy?
That's a big owl, sitting there, staring at you.
It's cool... but no.
What do we got up next?
We got item #27, we got this two-post hydraulic lift, model NT9...
All right, let's get ready.
You ready?
Who'll give me 950?
950 over here, now 1000. 1000 over here, we got 1000.
Now... 1100.
Go, go!
1100, we got 1100, who'll go 1150?
1150 over here.
Now 12. 12 over here.
Get him, get him.
12, now 13.
Who'll go 13?
Anybody go 13?
13?
He's stealing it over here, friends.
You know they go for twice this.
1200 going once, 1200 going twice...
Sold for $1200 to the man from Dillon!
And sir, you stole that item, there.
Got it, Billy!
We're gonna bring our next item...
That was huge!
Take a gander to your left, my right, friends, and we have got a Texas longhorn steer.
You could be riding Beevo home tonight.
We have money left, don't we?
I defy anyone to pass through Riggins' Rigs with that steer in front of it, and not go inside.
If you get that, you're making clients for life.
Listen to me.
Hey, listen to me.
Things happen for a reason, Billy.
And this guy right here, he's one of 'em.
No regrets.
All right.
Look at that!
Who's gonna give me $1500?
1500 over here...
Ok, this is for... great report card, all your help around the house, all your help with Gracie Belle, I could not have done without you...
So for all that, and for being the most beautiful, amazing daughter anyone could ever dream of...
Are you guys kidding me?
It's mine?
Yeah.
It's not like a family shared, no?
No.
We got the first payment, we split the rest of the payments and the insurance.
Oh, my God, that's so rad!
Honey!
That'll do.
I didn't think about her driving it.
You hold her.
I'm getting in there, you're not going anywhere without me.
You and I are staying safe right here.
Wait for me, wait for me!
Plastic still on the floor!
Look at this!
I like it, I like it, I like it!
What?
Is this not what you wanted?
No, no, this is perfect.
This is perfect.
I don't know, it's stupid, I just...
I don't know.
I just...
I never thought that Matt would actually move away to school, and... all my friends would be leaving high school, and...
Just kinda feeling left behind.
It's a lotta change.
And... and a lot of it's really, you know, really good.
And I'm really proud of him, and he's done a really, really good job, and...
It's stupid.
It's not stupid, honey.
So stupid.
It's a hard, hard thing.
And y'all have had a really nice relationship.
And you don't know what's gonna happen after that.
If you are meant to be together, you'll be together, and if you're not... there's gonna be somebody else special for you.
But it's not Matt.
I know it's hard to say goodbye.
Good morning.
Good morning.
This is my grandson.
Morning, good to see you.
He's a quarterback.
Or used to be.
Yeah, I'm Matthew.
Bye, we'll see y'all in a bit.
Which hall is it?
It's this one.
All right, put these there, too.
Matthew, you've gotta be exhausted.
No, no, I'm good, I just...
I just want to help you get all this stuff... you know, put away.
That can go on that shelf, there.
Matthew.
What?
Go home.
Honey...
Go, I...
I'll be fine.
You got your chair, so...
All set?
I'll talk to you later.
Ok.
All right.
One in a thousand!
One in a thousand...
They should just tell you on the application,
"Do not apply."
I mean, what the hell?
You know what?
It's fine, 'cause I have a great job at Applebee's, and my sister can get me a job at the Landing Strip in no time.
And you and I, why don't we just get married and start popping 'em out?
'Cause I'm gonna be here forever, it seems.
Ok, that's it, I can't take this one in a thousand!
one second longer.
What are you doing?
I cannot take you talking for another two hours with this!
What the hell are you doing?
We're in the middle of nowhere!
I cannot take you feeling sorry for yourself, Tyra!
You care so much about what everyone else thinks about you!
And what some idiot in some college thinks about you.
Landry, it's not just one idiot, ok?
I coulda sworn we'd been...
No.
When so many people tell you one thing about yourself, you start to believe it, ok?
So you know what?
Screw you!
Screw you, Mr. 4.2-GPA-can-go- wherever-the-hell-you-want!
Yeah, screw you.
You don't have a clue what my life's like, or how hard this has been, how hard I've worked!
I've worked since I was 13 to frikking get here!
You don't understand!
Don't you just stop it for one second?
Ok, I don't care what anyone else thinks about you.
I don't care what a counselor thinks about you.
I don't care what you think about yourself, but I believe in you, ok?
I could care less what anyone else thinks.
I believe in you.
And I want this for you more than anything.
But you just gotta start... believe in yourself, Tyra.
You know, maybe we shoulda got that steer towed, because I think it taxed the engine too much.
No kidding, dumbass!
You know what else?
I hate San Antonio State!
Who cares, Tim?
Bars are junk.
They don't even have a place like Smitty's where I can just go relax, you know, and just be me.
Maybe that's good for you, Tim.
I got 4 classes all in a row.
There's no "me" time, Billy.
I'm getting these books, they... are like 800 pages long!
Where's the "me" time, Billy?
What are you talking about?
Would you shut up for 2 seconds, and try and crank the engine.
Please!
Thank you!
I'm telling you my deal.
I don't care about your deal!
Crank it!
I'm cranking!
I ask you a question?
What?
Why mess with the alternator?
It's not generating enough juice.
Yeah, it is, man.
It's the timing.
How would you know?
Oh, you gotta listen to this baby.
She'll talk to you, man.
Really?
What are you, the car whisperer, Tim?
Seriously, I just put a new distributor in there a week ago.
Serious, give her a whirl now.
Just try it.
Billy, we got it started, what are you pouting about?
I just bought a frikking repair shop, Tim, and I can't even fix my own damn car!
Shoulda never bought that damn garage, man!
Seriously!
If I don't start making money like right now,
I'm gonna lose that property, I'm gonna lose everything.
Be back down to zero!
You know what, Billy?
You buying that garage was the best damn thing you've done your entire life.
You're living the American dream.
Please!
You have your own business, you're gonna have your own employees.
You'll be able to go home, hang with the wife, have a beer here and there, and watch your kids grow up in front of you.
It's pretty darn cool, man.
You don't believe a word that you're saying, do you?
Funny thing is, I wish I was in your shoes, man.
It'd be pretty cool, huh?
The Riggins brothers... sitting around all day, fixing cars, drinking beer.
Anyway... it better work.
Mindy's pregnant.
What?
Say that again.
Mindy's pregnant!
For real?
Yeah, hundred percent!
Don't go telling everybody about this, either.
Hundred percent, we have a little football coming our way?
Something like that.
You're kidding me!
Are you kidding me?
Congratulations, Billy!
You got a kid and your own business?
That's incredible!
Get off of me!
It's a beautiful car, great gas mileage.
Like I say, it's a family car now.
You know, when we were kids, it was... it was all about sporty, but this is...
Look at this!
Hey, baby!
Hi, Daddy.
Excuse me just a minute.
Go ahead, take a seat.
Sorry.
That's all right.
What?
I think we should talk to Uncle Gary.
Mama, we don't show her the letter till tomorrow, after the wedding.
I know how you feel, but I just don't think that's right.
It's unethical!
I can't have her being all mopey and Tyra-ish the whole time.
I know, but it's not right.
And not ethical!
It is uneth...
What's not right?
What're you talking about?
What is that?
What is it?
It's from UT.
Oh, my God!
Just a first receipt!
Just wait like a couple days!
It came!
Is that the letter?
It came!
It's thin.
I wonder what that means.
That doesn't mean anything...
All letters are thin.
Are you gonna open it?
I'm afraid.
Look at me.
You deserve this, ok?
I can honestly say you have worked harder than anyone could have worked for this, ok?
You'll love me no matter what?
No matter what, I promise.
All right.
I'm obviously... shaking.
What did I tell you?
I got in.
Oh, my baby's going to college!
My baby's going to college!
I'm so proud of you!
I love you.
I love you.
Oh, my God!
I'm proud of you.
Now it's time to move on to our final piece of business today.
Mr. McCoy!
Have you had a chance to speak with Wade about his interest in coming in as head coach?
Yes, Mr. Superintendent, I have.
Wade is ready and eager to take on the position.
All right.
Now, as far as salary goes...
He'll take whatever we give him, or I will personally kick his ass.
All kidding aside, Wade understands that this is a... first-year coaching position.
He knows the range.
Bottom line is, he gets it.
Thank you.
All right, then.
Now, before we put this to a vote, let me ask if anyone else would like to speak on behalf of Coach Aikmen... or Coach Taylor.
I did not want to be here today.
Here I am.
I love my job, I'm good at it, and I'd like to keep it.
I love this school,
I love the kids.
And I feel like I've just gotten started here.
There's some people here who want to replace me for a man with an awful lot of money and a boy with a good arm.
To those people I would say, you're wrong.
You are dead wrong.
You all have a good Saturday.
Stay still, stay still.
You gotta be kidding me.
They offered the job to Wade Aikmen.
All right, now we know.
And, hon... the board would like to offer you the position of head coach at East Dillon High.
Well, hello, gorgeous!
This... is for you.
Thanks.
I gotta tell you something.
Shoot.
Yesterday... when you were at... the auction?
I had this... crazy idea in my head that Principal Taylor and my dad put in... just about me going to Vanderbilt, and that I can still go and...
So we went to my uncle and got the money so that I could go, and...
I'm not gonna go, and I don't wanna go.
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that I would even think of doing that without talking to you first...
Go.
What?
You need to go to Vanderbilt.
I don't want to.
Is that what you want?
No.
What I want is to be with you.
Listen to me.
I love you.
I love you, too.
So much.
And this...
San Antonio State...
You're so much better than that.
So much.
We know this, we know this.
And these opportunities... happen for a reason.
I'm not gonna be that guy that stopped you from achieving your dreams.
Look, we...
Don't let me be that guy.
Go.
You don't wanna dance?
Not really.
So...
I don't wanna be all Debbie Downer at the wedding or anything, but...
I've been thinking.
Look, you're going away to college.
You're gonna meet new people and have new experiences, and... take different classes, and... meet a lot of new girls, and...
I don't wanna be that high school couple that has to stay together just to prove everybody wrong, and gets in fights all the time over the phone, and never sees each other...
And I love you...
I just think we should break up.
It's not really a yes or no question.
Too bad, 'cause we're not breaking up.
Julie, I love you.
We're gonna be fine.
Come here.
It's gonna be ok.
All right?
Your grandma would've really liked this wedding.
Yeah, she would.
Hey, Grandma!
Matthew!
What are you doing here, honey?
Get up, take the curlers out of your hair, and we're gonna go to a wedding, ok?
That's crazy, sweetie.
No.
We're gonna go to a wedding, and then I'm gonna take you home.
For good.
Honey.
No, you can't do that...
No, I can't...
Listen.
You're the only person who's never left me.
I'm not gonna leave you.
You mean go back home?
I'm gonna stay here.
My chair!
I'm gonna need my chair.
It's kind of a sucky day, hon.
Well, the rib eye was good.
I don't even know what the hell we're doing here.
I don't even know Billy Riggins that well.
I think they think very highly of us.
Hi.
Hi.
You know what?
No matter what happens, no matter where you go, no matter what you do,
I'm always gonna be behind you.
Always, and always, and always.
I know that.
I know that.
Look, everybody's all...
lined up.
Come on, there's some place I wanna go.
Gimme the keys, I'm driving.
Don't worry about the keys.
Hey, I need a minute.
You're kidding me!
No, I need a minute.
Gimme a minute.
You're an ass.
What?
Lyla's going to Vanderbilt.
So what?
So everything!
She was the sole purpose of me going to college.
Now, I don't have to go,
I'm staying in Dillon, is what it means.
Riggins' Rigs!
We're in it together now!
We're gonna be popping beer, making money, getting off early!
I'm telling you!
You're not getting it, Billy!
Come here!
You listen to me, you little idiot.
You're not gonna wuss out on this.
You're gonna go to college get a degree.
And I don't care if it takes you seven years, all right?
And when you start thinking that it's too hard, or that you can't handle it, remember one thing.
I want you to think about the kids that you don't have yet, and I want you to think about my kids, me and Mindy's kids, that we don't have yet.
And you'll get the job done, so that I can tell them that they don't have to settle for second best, that they can be whoever they want to be, because their uncle Timmy went to college.
God bless our mom and dad, wherever the hell they are.
But we gotta do better by our kids.
Do you hear me?
Tim!
I thought...
Do you hear me?
All right.
I gotta get out of here and go to Portico.
So don't... torch the house.
No promises.
Have fun.
Love you!
I don't want to hold him back.
I can't stand the thought of losing him.
I know.
Me neither.
I spent all this time trying to go to college.
It's seeming more and more impossible.
You are gonna have everything you are dreaming of.
The Vanderbilt thing not working out was fate.
I'm going to San Antonio with Tim.
- You liked calling the cops on my dad.
- That's not true.
- Katie, I had no choice.
- I want nothing to do with you.
Redistricting, try to open up East Dillon High...
It's never gonna happen.
No one is gonna stand by and let the Dillon Panthers get dismantled because of some dang politics! And Panther wide receiver and quarterback
Matt Saracen will be going to the prestigious Art Institute of Chicago next year.
And Panther tailback Tim Riggins will be going to San Antonio State University.
Congratulations, Tim.
We're all so proud of you.
And Lyla Garrity, number two in her class, will be attending...
San Antonio State University next year.
That's great, Lyla.
And Tyra Collette, who's done such a great job this year as student council president...
let's give her a big hand for that!
And she is still in the process of making a decision between some real exciting possibilities for next year.
She's been wait-listed at UT!
She's gonna get in.
- Mama, seriously...
Stop.
- She's gonna get in!
Very exciting, very exciting.
Congratulations on all your great, hard work...
All right, here we go, listen up!
You are now officially released until August 1st.
What do you say?
Final note.
J.D.!
I want everyone to know that J.D. has been named...
Dave Campbell's High School Quarterback of the Year.
Let's give him a hand.
J.D., why don't you break 'em down?
Let's go.
Y'all have a good summer, now.
Bring it in!
One now... 2, 3!
- Panther pride!
- J.D.!
Way to go, 12!
Way to go!
You know that Coach Taylor's contract is up for discussion
- at the board meeting this Saturday.
- Yes, I do.
And I want to give you the option to recuse yourself.
- Why would I want to do that?
- Well, Tami, he is your husband.
Yeah, he is, and...
These contract negotiations can get heated.
It might be difficult to stay objective under the current circumstances.
I actually have a lot of confidence in my ability to stay objective, and professional, and... and do my job as principal, so...
OK.
Hey, Paul.
Is there...
Is there a question about Eric's contract for next year?
Like I said, Tami, these matters are complicated.
Right, well...
The Aveo 5 is a beautiful car.
Besides that, you got side airbags, and that's the whole reason I want...
Look, enough about the damn car, would you please!
- What the hell am I doing?
- You know what we're doing.
Yeah.
It's recruitment, everybody does it, I understand.
It is not recruitment.
If it were recruitment, it would be illegal.
- Whatever you wanna call it, all right.
- It's simply a visit.
I want you to meet the parents.
We got to get there before Smith, from Arnett Mead.
That's the whole point.
Great.
When we get there, you can do the talking, that's what you do best.
- He may offer him something, we're not.
- It's this right, right up here.
So I don't have to tell y'all about the tradition of Dillon Panther football.
I mean, you see what Smash Williams is doing this year over at AM.
And he's just the last player that we've had go into college.
And so many players have gone into the pros.
So Shane going to Dillon means that he's gonna
- probably be with the best coach...
- Mr. Garrity!
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but...
I might as well just tell you.
We've already made our decision.
Shane's gonna go to Dillon High.
Right, son?
Yes, sir.
Well, that's...
That's excellent.
Congratulations.
- That's a good decision.
- I just have one question, though.
Who's the head coach?
Well, Eric's the head coach.
It's not Wade Aikmen?
No, sir.
Wade Aikmen's been helping us out with our offense, but no...
Eric's the head coach.
When they come by last week, I sure got the impression that...
Who came by?
Wade Aikmen.
Him and that other fellow, what was his name?
- McCoy.
- Yeah, McCoy.
They sure made it sound like they were the ones making the decisions.

Eat that one.
I think I know why they want you to recuse yourself.
I think it's a negotiating thing, you know?
They're trying to get you to take less money, or something.
A scare tactic.
Joe McCoy, Wade Aikmen, over at the Dubuque house... acting like they're running the team?
Joe McCoy's trying to get me fired.
I don't think so.
I mean, that's, that's pretty low.
They're mad at us, but I can't believe that they would do that.
I know, baby.
Eat those, eat those!
I can.
- Lorraine, you need all these dresses?
- Yes, ma'am, we do.
Please, just put them in that suitcase.
I got 'em all out for that reason.
Grandma!
It's only 15 minutes away.
You don't need to bring everything.
Well, I need my dresses, though.
If you were a woman, you'd understand.
I understand you need your clothes, you just don't need all of 'em.
Right, Julie?
You understand.
I need my clothes.
- She needs her clothes.
Yes, ma'am.
- Thanks, Julie.
Maybe just leave some here, you know, for when you come back.
What about the magazines from the 70s?
Can we just pitch them?
No, I'm not through.
There's a recipe in there, in one of those.
I still need them.
If you'd just put them in that box,
- that'd be great.
Do you remember this?
- Oh, my gosh!
- Shelby, did you see this?
- What?
- Just leave it in the box.
- Look at how cute it is.
Oh, my God.
- Look at your hair!
- OK, 7th grade was a bad year.
No, it's cute.
Well, I want this picture, and that's why I packed it, I'm taking it.
Look, Grandma, either way, you can take the picture, but you don't have to take everything.
That's right, I don't.
But I darn sure am gonna take this picture!
Let's suppose you're at college, I wake up one morning, I have one my spells, and I can't... can't remember you...
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna look right up on my wall, and there you're gonna be, with that smile... that precious, precious boy.
That's my concern.
- Just... go in?
- I know, I see...
I see your point.
Well, I do see your point.
Now I do...
Hey!
- Thanks for coming.
Come on in.
- Hey, baby.
What's going on?
Well...
Go ahead.
We just wanted to talk to you about going to San Antonio State.
What about it?
Well, I think your dad has some concerns about the quality of the school, for you, and I frankly agree that it may not be the best fit.
I'm already going.
I mean...
I was already there, I paid the tuition, and I'm enrolled.
- It's done.
- Yeah, but honey, it's a party school.
It's not a party school, Dad.
It's a good school.
It's a crap-ass party school, and Tim Riggins is going there,
- and that's the reason you're going.
- You know what, Dad?
Maybe you shouldn't have blown my college fund on tearing up a strip club!
- Listen, honey.
I...
- You see what I'm up against.
If you'll excuse me, please.
I do not mean to interfere in any way, but I did want you to know that at your dad's request, I called Vanderbilt.
They actually are willing to extend the decision until Monday.
If you choose to go, they would like to have you.
How're we gonna pay for it?
Well...
I thought maybe we could call your uncle Gary.
- He hates you.
- Well,
I'm not really fond of him either, but...
I'm the one who did this to you, and I feel like I...
I'll do anything, honey, for you to be able to go to Vanderbilt.
Even call Uncle Gary, so...
It's a big decision.
It's an important decision.
And I think Tim will understand.
How you doing?
What's up?
- Doing OK?
- Ginnie Warwick!
She got into Brown.
- I know that.
- She came to celebrate with her family and I got to serve her.
Which is pretty much the metaphor for my future.
Oh, and, you know, Vickie Savo?
She's going to Rice.
So... that's awesome.
What, now, you are going to UT.
- You sound like my mother.
- You are.
Well, no, I'm on the wait list, OK?
And there's nothing you can do when you're on the wait list, except wait!
- Why don't you just go to UT, then?
- UT?
Yeah, why don't you find the admissions officer who sent the letter, and just talk to him directly?
It's a lot better than just sitting around here and beating on my car.
Well, it's a bit desperate.
You are desperate.
What can I do for you, Eric?
Buddy Garrity and I went over to Shane Dubuque's yesterday.
That kid's an animal.
- Like a water?
- No.
As I understand it, you and Wade were over there last week.
Yeah, that's right.
You might be able to imagine how that makes me feel.
Hey, if we lost Shane Dubuque to Arnett Mead, we'd be dead next year.
So I figure, we need him, let's go get him.
Hey, Joe, I don't want you and Wade running around making house calls, acting like you represent this team.
I didn't see you moving aggressively on him, and I did not wanna miss
- that opportunity.
- Joe, you do not represent this team.
I backed up a truckload of cash for this team, this year.
Without my son, there is no team.
So as far as I'm concerned, I represent this team
- as much as anybody else in this town.
- You trying to replace me?
If you would like to continue,
I need your guarantee that, barring injury, of course, my son starts every game next season.
I also need your guarantee
- that Wade Aikmen calls all the plays.
- Mac calls my plays.
Yeah, I know.
Joe, I don't give a damn how much money you got, and I don't care how well you think that boy of yours can throw a football.
But you're not just messing with my livelihood now,
- you are threatening my family.
- I'm not threatening anybody.
Against my better judgment,
I'm offering you an opportunity to continue with this team.
I'm sure you know what you can do with that opportunity.
- I'm pushing down on the broom!
- You're not pushing hard enough.
I'm putting pressure on the broom.
You push so fast, it won't pick up the dirt!
Hi, guys.
- So, what do you think?
- I think it's amazing.
- Really?
- It looks good, doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.
I can't believe you guys actually pulled it off.
It looks great.
Good job.
So, you hungry?
Kinda.
Wanna go get something to eat, work on our schedules?
I do... bad.
But Billy and I, we're gonna head out of town to...
We gotta go pick up a hydraulic lift at auction.
It's kind of a big deal, so...
- OK.
- Really, OK?
Hey, how'd it go with...
Mrs. Taylor today, your meeting?
It went fine.
- Sweet.
What'd she want?
- Just wanted to talk about my schedule.
Did she?
Perfect.
- Mr. Garth?
- Dr. Garth.
- Can I help you?
- Hi, I'm Tyra Collette.
I'm on the wait list.
I just...
I wanted to tell you how much... how much I appreciate being on the list, and how much I respect the process.
And I don't wanna rush it, but...
I just wanted to tell you that going to UT has been a dream of mine pretty much my entire life.
It's the dream.
And if there's anything I can do to help my chances...
Do you have your letter with you?
- I do, it's... it's right here.
- Thanks.
Let's see.
Miss Collette, I need you to understand, we get over 35,000 applications each year.
And we put about a thousand on the wait list.
A thousand?
So, a thousand people got that letter?
Unfortunately, yeah.
That's the way the system works.
- You need to come to that meeting.
- Why?
To stand up for your job.
There's nothing I could, should, or need to say at that meeting.
They can see what I've done and decide.
If they want Joe McCoy to take over this team... that's their damn funeral!
I don't think that's a good strategy.
- That's because it's not a strategy.
- I know.
But I'm starting to think that we're gonna need a strategy.
I can't outtalk nor outspend, that's for damn sure, Joe McCoy.
I know.
I have given everything I've got for this team.
I've still got that, I still got my pride, I'm not giving that up.
Uh-uh, honey, you're never gonna give up your pride.
But if you don't fight for this, I think we're gonna regret it.
All right, we got several good items here.
You can take a look around and see there are things you cannot buy in a store, 'cause they just would not sell 'em.
Right now, item #42 over here, we got the Lincoln arc welding machine.
We got this barber chair...
That's stupid.
... item #28, that's an owl head, which is made from a deer's rear end.
Who'll give me $25 on the owl head taxidermy?
That's a big owl, sitting there, staring at you.
It's cool...
but no.
What do we got up next?
We got item #27, we got this two-post hydraulic lift, model NT9...
All right, let's get ready.
You ready?
Who'll give me 950?
950 over here, now 1000. 1000 over here, we got 1000.
Now... 1100.
- Go, go!
- 1100, we got 1100, who'll go 1150?
- 1150 over here.
Now 12. 12 over here.
- Get him, get him.
12, now 13.
Who'll go 13?
Anybody go 13?
13?
He's stealing it over here, friends.
You know they go for twice this.
1200 going once, 1200 going twice...
Sold for $1200 to the man from Dillon!
And sir, you stole that item, there.
Got it, Billy!
- We're gonna bring our next item...
- That was huge!
Take a gander to your left, my right, friends, and we have got a Texas longhorn steer.
You could be riding Beevo home tonight.
We have money left, don't we?
I defy anyone to pass through Riggins' Rigs with that steer in front of it, and not go inside.
If you get that, you're making clients for life.
Listen to me.
Hey, listen to me.
Things happen for a reason, Billy.
And this guy right here, he's one of 'em.
No regrets.
- All right.
- Look at that!
Who's gonna give me $1500?
1500 over here...
OK, this is for...
great report card, all your help around the house, all your help with Gracie Belle, I could not have done without you...
So for all that, and for being the most beautiful, amazing daughter anyone could ever dream of...
Are you guys kidding me?
- It's mine?
- Yeah.
- It's not like a family shared, no?
- No.
We got the first payment, we split the rest of the payments and the insurance.
Oh, my God, that's so rad!
- Honey!
- That'll do.
I didn't think about her driving it.
You hold her.
I'm getting in there, you're not going anywhere without me.
- You and I are staying safe right here.
- Wait for me, wait for me!
Plastic still on the floor!
Look at this!
I like it, I like it, I like it!
What?
- Is this not what you wanted?
- No, no, this is perfect.
This is perfect.
I don't know, it's stupid, I just...
I don't know.
I just...
I never thought that Matt would actually move away to school, and... all my friends would be leaving high school, and...
Just kinda feeling left behind.
It's a lotta change.
And... and a lot of it's really, you know, really good.
And I'm really proud of him, and he's done a really, really good job, and...
It's stupid.
- It's not stupid, honey.
- So stupid.
It's a hard, hard thing.
And y'all have had a really nice relationship.
And you don't know what's gonna happen after that.
If you are meant to be together, you'll be together, and if you're not... there's gonna be somebody else special for you.
But it's not Matt.
I know it's hard to say goodbye.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
This is my grandson.
Morning, good to see you.
He's a quarterback.
Or used to be.
Yeah, I'm Matthew.
Bye, we'll see y'all in a bit.
Which hall is it?
It's this one.
All right, put these there, too.
- Matthew, you've gotta be exhausted.
- No, no, I'm good, I just...
I just want to help you get all this stuff... you know, put away.
- That can go on that shelf, there.
- Matthew.
- What?
- Go home.
Honey...
Go, I...
I'll be fine.
You got your chair, so...
- All set?
I'll talk to you later.
- OK.
All right.
One in a thousand!
One in a thousand...
They should just tell you on the application,
"Do not apply."
I mean, what the hell?
You know what?
It's fine, 'cause I have a great job at Applebee's, and my sister can get me a job at the Landing Strip in no time.
And you and I, why don't we just get married and start popping 'em out?
'Cause I'm gonna be here forever, it seems.
- OK, that's it, I can't take this
- One in a thousand!
one second longer.
- What are you doing?
- I cannot take you talking for another two hours with this!
What the hell are you doing?
We're in the middle of nowhere!
I cannot take you feeling sorry for yourself, Tyra!
You care so much about what everyone else thinks about you!
And what some idiot in some college thinks about you.
Landry, it's not just one idiot, OK?
- I coulda sworn we'd been...
- No.
When so many people tell you one thing about yourself, you start to believe it, OK?
So you know what?
Screw you!
Screw you, Mr. 4.2-GPA-can-go- wherever-the-hell-you-want!
Yeah, screw you.
You don't have a clue what my life's like, or how hard this has been, how hard I've worked!
I've worked since I was 13 to frikking get here!
- You don't understand!
- Don't you just stop it for one second?
OK, I don't care what anyone else thinks about you.
I don't care what a counselor thinks about you.
I don't care what you think about yourself, but I believe in you, OK?
I could care less what anyone else thinks.
I believe in you.
And I want this for you more than anything.
But you just gotta start...
believe in yourself, Tyra.
You know, maybe we shoulda got that steer towed, because I think it taxed
- the engine too much.
- No kidding, dumbass!
You know what else?
I hate San Antonio State!
- Who cares, Tim?
- Bars are junk.
They don't even have a place like Smitty's where I can just go relax,
- you know, and just be me.
- Maybe that's good for you, Tim.
I got 4 classes all in a row.
There's no "me" time, Billy.
I'm getting these books, they... are like 800 pages long!
- Where's the "me" time, Billy?
- What are you talking about?
Would you shut up for 2 seconds, and try and crank the engine.
Please!
- Thank you!
- I'm telling you my deal.
I don't care about your deal!
- Crank it!
- I'm cranking!
- I ask you a question?
- What?
- Why mess with the alternator?
- It's not generating enough juice.
Yeah, it is, man.
It's the timing.
How would you know?
Oh, you gotta listen to this baby.
She'll talk to you, man.
Really?
What are you, the car whisperer, Tim?
Seriously, I just put a new distributor in there a week ago.
Serious, give her a whirl now.
Just try it.
Billy, we got it started, what are you pouting about?
I just bought a frikking repair shop, Tim, and I can't even fix my own damn car!
Shoulda never bought that damn garage, man!
Seriously!
If I don't start making money like right now,
I'm gonna lose that property, I'm gonna lose everything.
Be back down to zero!
You know what, Billy?
You buying that garage was the best damn thing you've done your entire life.
You're living the American dream.
- Please!
- You have your own business, you're gonna have your own employees.
You'll be able to go home, hang with the wife, have a beer here and there, and watch your kids grow up in front of you.
It's pretty darn cool, man.
You don't believe a word that you're saying, do you?
Funny thing is, I wish I was in your shoes, man.
It'd be pretty cool, huh?
The Riggins brothers... sitting around all day, fixing cars, drinking beer.
Anyway... it better work.
Mindy's pregnant.
What?
Say that again.
Mindy's pregnant!
- For real?
- Yeah, hundred percent!
Don't go telling everybody about this, either.
Hundred percent, we have a little football coming our way?
- Something like that.
- You're kidding me!
Are you kidding me?
Congratulations, Billy!
You got a kid and your own business?
- That's incredible!
- Get off of me!
It's a beautiful car, great gas mileage.
Like I say, it's a family car now.
You know, when we were kids, it was... it was all about sporty, but this is...
Look at this!
- Hey, baby!
- Hi, Daddy.
Excuse me just a minute.
Go ahead, take a seat.
- Sorry.
- That's all right.
- What?
- I think we should talk to Uncle Gary.
Mama, we don't show her the letter till tomorrow, after the wedding.
I know how you feel, but I just don't think that's right.
{\
- It's unethical!
- }I can't have her being all mopey
- and Tyra-ish the whole time.
- I know, but it's not right.
- And not ethical!
- It is uneth...
What's not right?
What're you talking about?
What is that?
- What is it?
- It's from UT.
- Oh, my God!
- Just a first receipt!
Just wait like a couple days!
It came!
- Is that the letter?
- It came!
- It's thin.
I wonder what that means.
- That doesn't mean anything...
All letters are thin.
Are you gonna open it?
I'm afraid.
Look at me.
You deserve this, OK?
I can honestly say you have worked harder than anyone could have worked for this, OK?
- You'll love me no matter what?
- No matter what, I promise.
All right.
I'm obviously... shaking.
- What did I tell you?
- I got in.
Oh, my baby's going to college!
My baby's going to college!
I'm so proud of you!
- I love you.
- I love you.
Oh, my God!
I'm proud of you.
Now it's time to move on to our final piece of business today.
Mr. McCoy!
Have you had a chance to speak with Wade about his interest in coming in as head coach?
Yes, Mr. Superintendent, I have.
Wade is ready and eager to take on the position.
All right.
Now, as far as salary goes...
He'll take whatever we give him, or I will personally kick his ass.
All kidding aside, Wade understands that this is a... first-year coaching position.
He knows the range.
Bottom line is, he gets it.
Thank you.
All right, then.
Now, before we put this to a vote, let me ask if anyone else would like to speak on behalf of Coach Aikmen... or Coach Taylor.
I did not want to be here today.
Here I am.
I love my job, I'm good at it, and I'd like to keep it.
I love this school,
I love the kids.
And I feel like I've just gotten started here.
There's some people here who want to replace me for a man with an awful lot of money and a boy with a good arm.
To those people I would say, you're wrong.
You are dead wrong.
You all have a good Saturday.
Stay still, stay still.
You gotta be kidding me.
They offered the job to Wade Aikmen.
All right, now we know.
And, hon... the board would like to offer you the position of head coach at East Dillon High.
Well, hello, gorgeous!
This... is for you.
Thanks.
I gotta tell you something.
Shoot.
Yesterday... when you were at...
the auction?
I had this... crazy idea in my head that Principal Taylor and my dad put in... just about me going to Vanderbilt, and that I can still go and...
So we went to my uncle and got the money so that I could go, and...
I'm not gonna go, and I don't wanna go.
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that I would even think of doing that without talking to you first...
Go.
What?
You need to go to Vanderbilt.
- I don't want to.
- Is that what you want?
- No.
What I want is to be with you.
- Listen to me.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
So much.
And this...
San Antonio State...
You're so much better than that.
So much.
We know this, we know this.
And these opportunities... happen for a reason.
I'm not gonna be that guy that stopped you from achieving your dreams.
- Look, we...
- Don't let me be that guy.
Go.
You don't wanna dance?
Not really.
So...
I don't wanna be all Debbie Downer at the wedding or anything, but...
I've been thinking.
Look, you're going away to college.
You're gonna meet new people and have new experiences, and... take different classes, and... meet a lot of new girls, and...
I don't wanna be that high school couple that has to stay together just to prove everybody wrong, and gets in fights all the time over the phone, and never sees each other...
And I love you...
I just think we should break up.
- It's not really a yes or no question.
- Too bad, 'cause we're not breaking up.
Julie, I love you.
We're gonna be fine.
Come here.
It's gonna be OK.
All right?
Your grandma would've really liked this wedding.
Yeah, she would.
Hey, Grandma!
Matthew!
What are you doing here, honey?
Get up, take the curlers out of your hair, and we're gonna go to a wedding, OK?
- That's crazy, sweetie.
- No.
We're gonna go to a wedding, and then I'm gonna take you home.
For good.
Honey.
No, you can't do that...
No, I can't...
Listen.
You're the only person who's never left me.
I'm not gonna leave you.
You mean go back home?
I'm gonna stay here.
My chair!
I'm gonna need my chair.
It's kind of a sucky day, hon.
Well, the rib eye was good.
I don't even know what the hell we're doing here.
I don't even know Billy Riggins that well.
I think they think very highly of us.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You know what?
No matter what happens, no matter where you go, no matter what you do,
I'm always gonna be behind you.
Always, and always, and always.
I know that.
I know that.
Look, everybody's all...
lined up.
Come on, there's some place I wanna go.
- Gimme the keys, I'm driving.
- Don't worry about the keys.
- Hey, I need a minute.
- You're kidding me!
- No, I need a minute.
Gimme a minute.
- You're an ass.
- What?
- Lyla's going to Vanderbilt.
- So what?
- So everything!
She was the sole purpose of me going to college.
Now, I don't have to go,
I'm staying in Dillon, is what it means.
Riggins' Rigs!
We're in it together now!
We're gonna be popping beer, making money, getting off early!
I'm telling you!
You're not getting it, Billy!
Come here!
You listen to me, you little idiot.
You're not gonna wuss out on this.
You're gonna go to college get a degree.
And I don't care if it takes you seven years, all right?
And when you start thinking that it's too hard, or that you can't handle it, remember one thing.
I want you to think about the kids that you don't have yet, and I want you to think about my kids, me and Mindy's kids, that we don't have yet.
And you'll get the job done, so that I can tell them that they don't have to settle for second best, that they can be whoever they want to be, because their uncle Timmy went to college.
God bless our mom and dad, wherever the hell they are.
But we gotta do better by our kids.
Do you hear me?
- Tim!
- I thought...
Do you hear me?
All right.
I gotta get out of here and go to Portico.
So don't...
torch the house.
No promises.
Have fun.
Love you!
I don't want to be the one to hold him back.
I just can't stand the thought of losing him.
I know.
Me neither.
I spent all this time trying to go to college, and it's even more and more impossible.
You are going to have everything you are dreaming of.
The whole Vanderbilt thing not working out was like fate.
I'm going to San Antonio State with Tim.
You liked calling the cops on my dad, didn't you?
That's not true.
Katie, I had no choice.
Then you'll forgive me if I want nothing to do with you.
Redistricting, trying to open up East Dillon High.
That's never gonna happen.
No one is gonna stand by and let the Dillon Panthers get dismantled because of some dang politics.
Good.
Is that your mom?
Nice to meet y'all.
And Panther wide receiver and quarterback Matt Saracen will be going to the prestigious
Art Institute of Chicago next year.
And Panther tailback Tim Riggins will be going to San Antonio State University.
Congratulations, Tim.
We're all so proud of you.
And Lyla Garrity, number two in her class, will be attending San Antonio State University next year.
That's great, Lyla.
And Tyra Collette, who's done such a great job this year as student council president, let's give her a big hand for that.
And she is still in the process of making a decision between some real exciting possibilities for next year.
She's been waitlisted at UT.
She's gonna get in.
She's gonna get in!
Okay, Mama.
Seriously.
Shh, stop.
That's very exciting.
Very exciting.
Congratulations on all your great hard work.
All right, here we go.
Listen up.
You are now officially released until August 1st.
What do you say?
Final note.
J.D.
I want everyone to know that J.D. has been named
Dave Camel's High School Quarterback of the Year.
Let's give him a hand.
J.D. why don't you break them down?
Let's go, gentlemen.
Y'all have a good summer, now.
Let's go.
Bring it in.
One, two, three...
Way to go, club.
Way to go.
You know that Coach Taylor's contract is up for discussion at the board meeting this Saturday.
Mmm-hmm.
Yes, I do.
And I want to give you the option to recuse yourself.
But why would I want to do that?
Well, Tami, he is your husband.
Yeah, he is.
These contract negotiations can get heated.
It might be difficult to stay objective under the current circumstances.
Well, actually, I have a lot of confidence in my ability to stay objective and professional and do my job as principal, so...
Okay.
Hey, Paul.
Is there...
Hmm?
Is there a question about Eric's contract for next year?
Like I said, Tami, these matters are complicated.
Right.
Well, okay.
The Aveo 5 is a beautiful car.
Besides that, you got side airbags.
That's the whole reason...
Shut up about the damn car, already, would you, please?
Okay.
What the hell am I doing here?
You know what we're doing.
Yeah, I know.
It's recruitment.
Everybody does it.
I understand.
It is not recruitment.
If it were recruitment, it would be illegal.
Call it whatever you wanna call it.
I understand.
It's simply a visit.
All right.
So I don't have to tell y'all about the tradition of Dillon Panther football.
I mean, you see what Smash Williams is doing this year over at AM.
And he's just the last player that we've had go into college.
And so many players have gone into the pros.
So, Shane going to Dillon means that he's gonna probably be with the best football coach...
Mr. Garrity, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I might as well just tell you.
We've already made our decision.
Shane's gonna go to Dillon High.
Oh.
Right, son?
Yes, sir.
Well, that's...
That's excellent.
Congratulations.
That's a good decision.
I just have one question, though.
Who's the head coach?
Well, Eric's the head coach.
It's not Wade Aikmen?
No, sir.
Wade Aikmen's been helping us out with our offense.
But no, Eric's the head coach.
When he came by last week, I sure got the impression that...
Who came by?
Wade Aikmen.
Him and that other fellow.
What was his name?
McCoy.
Yeah, McCoy.
They sure made it sound like they were the ones making the decisions.
Lorraine, are you sure you need all these dresses?
Yes, ma'am.
We do.
Please just put them in that suitcase.
Hey, Grandma.
Grandma.
I got them all out for that reason.
It's only 15 minutes away.
You don't need to bring everything.
Well, I need my dresses, though.
If you were a woman, you'd understand that.
No, I understand that you need your clothes.
Oh, my gosh.
Shelby, did you see this?
No, hey!
What?
Hey, let's just leave it in the box.
Look at how cute it is.
Good.
No.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
Oh, my God.
Look at your hair.
Okay, seventh grade was a bad year, all right?
No, it's cute.
Well, I want this picture, and that's why I packed it.
I'm taking it.
Look at that smile.
Either way, you can take the picture, but you don't have to take everything.
That's right, I don't.
But I darn sure am gonna take this picture.
Now, let's just suppose you're at college.
I wake up one morning and have one of my spells and I can't remember you.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna look right up on my wall.
And there you're gonna be.
With that smile.
That precious, precious boy.
That's my concern.
Just go in.
No, I see.
I see your point.
I do see your point.
Hey.
Thanks for coming.
Hey, baby.
Come on in.
What's going on?
Well...
Well...
Go ahead.
We just wanted to talk to you about going to San Antonio State.
What about it?
Well, I think your dad has some concerns about the quality of the school for you.
And I, frankly, agree that it may not be the best fit.
I'm already going.
I mean, I was already there and I paid the tuition.
And I'm enrolled.
And it's done.
Yeah, but, honey, it's a party school.
It's not a party school, Dad.
It's a good school.
Yes, it is.
It's a crap-ass party school.
And Tim Riggins is going there, and that's the reason you're going.
Yeah, well, you know what, Dad?
Maybe you shouldn't have blown all my college fund on tearing up a strip club, then.
Listen, honey...
See what I'm up against.
If you'll excuse me, please.
I do not mean to interfere in any way.
But I did want you to know that at your dad's request, I called Vanderbilt.
They actually are willing to extend the decision until Monday.
If you choose to go, they would like to have you.
How are we gonna pay for it?
Well...
I thought maybe we could call your Uncle Gary.
He hates you.
Well, I'm not really fond of him, either, but...
I'm the one who did this to you, and I feel like...
I'll do anything, honey, for you to be able to go to Vanderbilt.
Even call Uncle Gary.
So...
It's a big decision.
It's an important decision.
And I think Tim will understand.
How you doing?
What's up?
Doing okay?
Jenny Warwick.
She got into Brown.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know that.
Yeah, she came in to celebrate with her family, and I got to serve her.
Which is pretty much, you know, the metaphor for my future.
Oh, and you know Vicky Soho?
Yeah.
She's going to Rice.
So, that's awesome.
What?
And you are going to UT.
Don't say that.
You sound like my mother.
You are.
Well, no.
I'm on the waitlist, okay?
And there's nothing you can do when you're on the waitlist, except wait.
Why don't you just go to UT, then?
UT?
Yeah.
Why don't you find the admissions officer you've sent the letter, and just talk to him directly?
It's a lot better than just sitting around here and beating on my car.
Well, it's a bit desperate.
But you are desperate.
What can I do for you, Eric?
Buddy Garrity and I went over to Shane Dubuque's yesterday.
That kid's an animal.
Would you like a water?
No.
As I understand it, you and Wade were over there last week.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, well, you might be able to imagine how that makes me feel.
Hey, if we lost Shane Dubuque to Arnett Mead, we'd be dead next year.
So I figure we need him, let's go get him.
Hey, Joe, I don't want you and Wade running around making house calls, acting like you represent this team.
Well, I didn't see you moving aggressively on him, and I did not want to miss that opportunity.
Joe, you do not represent this team.
I backed up a truckload of cash for this team this year.
Without my son, there is no team.
So as far as I'm concerned,
I represent this team as much as anybody else in this town.
You're trying to replace me.
If you would like to continue,
I need your guarantee that, barring injury, of course, my son starts every game next season.
I also need your guarantee that Wade Aikmen calls all the plays.
Mac calls my plays.
Yeah, I know.
Joe, I don't give a damn how much money you got.
And I don't care how well you think that boy of yours can throw a football.
But you're not just messing with my livelihood now, you are threatening my family.
I'm not threatening anybody.
Against my better judgment,
I am offering you an opportunity to continue with this team.
Well, I'm sure you know what you can do with that opportunity.
I'm pushing down on the broom.
But you're not pushing hard enough.
If you push so fast, it won't pick up the dirt.
Stop!
Hi, guys.
Hi.
So, what do you think?
I think it's amazing.
Really?
Yes.
It looks good, doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.
I can't believe you guys actually pulled it off.
It looks great.
So, you hungry?
Kind of.
You wanna go get something to eat?
Work on our schedules?
I do, bad, but Billy and I were gonna head out of town to...
Yeah, we've got to go pick up a hydraulic lift at auction.
It's kind of a big deal, so...
Oh, okay.
Really okay?
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, how'd it go with Mrs. Taylor today at your meeting?
Um...
It went fine.
Sweet.
What'd she want?
She just wanted to talk about my schedule.
Did she?
Mmm-hmm.
Perfect.
Mr. Garth?
Can I help you?
Hi, I'm Tyra Collette.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm on the waitlist.
Okay.
I just...
I wanted to tell you how much...
How much I appreciate, you know, being on the list.
And I don't want to rush it, but...
I just wanted to tell you that going to UT has been a dream of mine pretty much my entire life.
It's the dream.
And if there's anything I can do to help my chances...
Um...
Yeah, Ms. Collette, I need you to understand, we get over 35,000 applications each year.
And we put about 1,000 on the waitlist.
1,000?
Yeah.
So, 1,000 people got that letter?
Unfortunately, yeah.
It's just, that's the way the system works.
Eric, you need to come to that meeting on Saturday.
Why?
Well, to stand up for your job.
Honey, there is nothing I could, should, or need to say at that meeting.
They can look at what I've done and decide for themselves.
If they want Joe McCoy to take over this team, it's their damn funeral.
I don't think that's a good strategy.
That's because it's not a strategy, hon.
I know.
But I'm starting to think that we're gonna need a strategy.
I can't outtalk, nor outspend, that's for damn sure, Joe McCoy.
I know.
I have given everything I've got for this team.
I've still got that.
I've still got my pride.
I'm not giving that up.
Uh-uh.
Honey, you're never gonna give up your pride.
But if you don't fight for this, I think we're gonna regret it.
All right, friends, we've got several good items here for you today.
You can take a look around and see there are things you cannot buy in a store, 'cause they just would not sell them.
Right now, item number 42 over here, we've got the Lincoln ArcWelding machine.
We've got this barber chair over here...
Uh-uh.
That's stupid.
Item number 28, that's an owl head, which is actually made from a deer's rear end.
Who'll give me $25 for the owl head taxidermy?
That's a big owl, sitting there staring at you.
It's cool, but no.
What do we got up next?
We got item number 27.
We got this two-post hydraulic lift.
Model NT9.
NT9.
All right, let's get ready.
Are you ready?
Start the bid off at $950.
Who'll give me $950?
There's $950 over here.
Now $1,000,
$1,000 over here.
We got $1,000.
Now $1,100. $1,100?
Got $1,100.
Go, go, go.
Who will go $1,150?
$1,150, we need...
$1,150 over here.
Get him.
Get him.
Do we have $1,200?
$1,200 over here.
$1,200, now $1,300.
Who will go $1,300?
Anybody go $1,300?
$1,300?
He's stealing it over here, friends.
You know they...
He's stealing it.
$1,200 going once.
$1,200 going twice.
Sold for $1,200.
Yeah!
To the man from Dillon.
Whoo!
Did it!
And, sir, you stole that item there.
Got it, man!
Right here.
We're gonna bring our next item on up here.
That's huge.
Take a gander to your left and my right, friends.
And we have got a Texas longhorn steer.
You could be riding Bibo home tonight...
We have money left, don't we?
I defy anyone to pass through Riggins' Rigs with that steer in front of it and not go inside!
If you get that, you'll make clients for life.
Listen to me.
Hey, listen to me.
Things happen for a reason, Billy.
And this guy right here, he's one of them.
No regrets.
All right.
Look at that.
Okay, this is for a great report card, all your help around the house, all your help with Gracie Belle, which I could not have done without you.
So, for all that, and for being the most beautiful, amazing daughter anyone could ever dream of...
Ta-da!
Are you guys kidding me?
No!
It's mine?
Yeah.
It's not like a family-shared, no?
No.
Listen, we got the first payment.
We split the rest of the payments.
And we split the insurance.
Oh, my God.
That's so rad.
Honey!
That'll do.
I didn't think about her driving it.
Here, you hold her.
I'm getting in there.
You're not going anywhere without me.
Wait for me!
We're gonna stay safe right here.
Ooh!
Plastic still on the floor.
Look at this.
I like it, I like it, I like it.
What?
Is this not what you wanted?
No.
No, no, no.
This is perfect.
This is perfect.
Hmm?
I don't know.
It's stupid.
I just...
I don't know.
I just...
I never thought that Matt would actually move away to school, and...
All my friends will be leaving high school, and...
Just...
Just kind of feeling left behind.
That's a lot of change.
And a lot of it's, you know, really good.
I'm really proud of him.
And he's done a really, really good job.
It's stupid.
It's not stupid, honey.
I'm so stupid.
It's a hard, hard thing.
And y'all have had a really nice relationship.
And you don't know what's gonna happen after that.
If you and Matt are meant to be together, you'll be together.
And if you're not, there's gonna be somebody else special for you.
But it's not Matt.
I know it's hard to say goodbye.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
This is my grandson.
Good to see you.
He's a quarterback.
Or used to be.
Yeah, Matthew.
Bye.
We'll see y'all in a bit.
Bye.
They'll call us in, honey.
No, this is the one.
Okay, put these there, too.
Oh, Matty, you've got to be exhausted.
Oh, no.
I'm good.
I just, you know...
I just want to help you get all this stuff, you know, put away.
Here, that could go on that shelf, there.
Matthew?
What?
Go home.
No, I...
Honey, go.
I'll be fine.
You've got your chair, so...
I'll see you, Grandma.
All right?
I'll talk to you.
Okay.
All right.
One in 1,000.
One in 1,000.
You know, they should just tell you on the application, "Do not apply.' '
I mean, what the hell?
You know what?
It's fine.
It's fine. 'Cause you know what?
I have a great job at Applebee's.
And my sister can get me a job at the Landing Strip in no time, you know.
And you and I, you know, why don't we just get married and start popping them out?
Because I'm going to be here forever, it seems, obviously.
Okay.
That's it.
That's it.
I can't take this one second longer.
What are you doing?
I cannot take you talking for another two hours with this.
Landry!
What the hell are you doing?
We're in the middle of nowhere!
I cannot take you feeling sorry for yourself, Tyra.
You care so much about what everyone else thinks about you and what some idiot in some college thinks about you.
Landry, it's not just one idiot, okay?
I could have sworn we'd been...
No.
When so many people tell you one thing about yourself, you start to believe it, okay?
So you know what?
Screw you.
Screw you, Mr. 4.2 GPA.
You can go wherever the hell you want.
Yeah, screw you.
You don't have a clue what my life's like or how hard this has been.
Or how hard I've worked.
That I've worked since I was 13 to frigging get here.
You don't understand...
Will you just stop it for one second?
Okay, I don't care what anyone else thinks about you.
I don't care what a counselor thinks about you.
I don't care what you think about yourself.
But I believe in you, okay?
I could care less what anyone else thinks.
Now, I believe in you.
And I want this for you more than anything.
But you've just got to start believing in yourself, Tyra.
You know, maybe we should have gotten that steer towed because I think it taxed the engine too much.
No kidding, dumb-ass.
You know what else?
I hate San Antonio State.
Who cares, Tim?
Bars are junk.
They don't even have a place like Smitty's where I can just go relax, you know, and just be me.
Well, you know, maybe that's good for you, Tim.
I got four classes, all in a row, there's no me time, Billy.
I'm getting these books that are, like, 800 pages long.
Where's the me time, Billy?
What are you talking about?
They want me to go in and start training.
Could you just shut up for two seconds and try to crank the engine?
Please.
Thank you.
I'm telling you my deal, man.
I don't care about your deal.
Crank it.
I'm cranking.
I asked you a question?
What?
Why are you messing with the alternator?
'Cause it's not getting enough juice to the engine.
Yeah, it is getting enough juice, man.
It's the timing.
How the hell would you know?
Oh, you gotta listen to this baby.
She'll talk to you, man.
Really?
What are you, the car whisperer, Tim?
Seriously, man.
I just put a new distributor in there a week ago.
Oh, yeah.
I'm serious, give her a whirl now.
Try.
Billy, we got it started.
What are you pouting about?
I just bought a frigging repair shop, Tim.
And I can't even fix my own damn car.
I should have never bought that damn garage, man.
Seriously.
If I don't start making money, like, right now,
I'm gonna lose that property, I'm gonna lose everything.
Be back down to zero.
You know what, Billy?
You buying that garage is the best damn thing you've done in your entire life.
Yeah, right.
You know what?
You're living the American dream right now.
You just have your own business, you're gonna have your own employees.
You'll be able to go home, hang with the wife, have a beer here and there, and watch your kids grow up right in front of you.
It's pretty darn cool, man.
You don't believe a word that you're saying, do you?
The funny thing is, I wish I was in your shoes, man.
It'd be pretty cool, huh?
Riggins brothers.
Just sitting around all day, fixing cars, drinking beer.
Yeah.
Anyway, it better work.
Mindy's pregnant.
What?
Say that again.
Mindy's pregnant.
For real?
Yeah. 100%.
Don't go telling everybody about this, either.
100%, we have a little football coming our way.
Something like that.
You're kidding me!
Get away from me.
Are you kidding me?
Congratulations!
You got a kid and your own business?
Get the hell off of me.
That's incredible!
Get off of me.
No.
It's gonna put those European sedans to shame.
It sure will.
It's a beautiful car, great gas mileage.
Like I say, it's a family car now.
You know, when we were kids, it was...
Hello, Lyla.
It was all about sporty, but this is...
Look at this.
Hey, baby.
Hi, Daddy.
Excuse me just a minute.
Go ahead, take a seat.
Sorry.
That's all right.
What?
I think we should talk to Uncle Gary.
Mama, all I'm saying is we don't show her the letter till tomorrow after the wedding.
I know how you feel, honey, but I just don't think that's right.
I can't have her being all mopey and Tyra-ish the whole time.
I know, but it's not right.
Not at all.
It is...
What's not right?
What are you guys talking about?
What is that?
What is it?
It's from UT.
Oh, my God!
Landry!
Just wait, like, a couple of days.
Landry, Landry!
Landry!
Landry.
It came.
Hey.
Is that the letter?
It came.
It's thin.
I don't know what that means.
That doesn't mean anything.
It just means that all letters are thin.
That's bad, right?
Are you gonna open it?
I don't know.
I'm afraid.
Look at me.
You deserve this, okay?
I can honestly say you have worked harder than anyone could've worked for this, okay?
You'll love me no matter what?
I'll love you no matter what, I promise.
All right.
I'm nervous.
Shaking.
Yeah.
What did I tell you?
I got in.
I got in!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my baby's going to college!
My baby's going to college.
Baby, I'm so proud of you.
I love you.
I love you.
Now it's time to move on to our final piece of business today.
Mr. McCoy.
Have you had a chance to speak with Wade about his interest in coming in as head coach?
Yes, Mr. Superintendent, I have.
Wade is ready and eager to take on the position.
All right, now, as far as salary goes...
He'll take whatever we give him, or I will personally kick his ass.
All kidding aside, Wade understands that this is a first-year coaching position.
He knows the range.
Bottom line is, he gets it.
Thank you.
All right, then.
Now, before we put this to a vote, let me ask if there is anyone else who would like to speak on behalf of Coach Aikmen or Coach Taylor.
I did not want to be here today.
Here I am.
I love my job.
I'm good at it, and I'd like to keep it.
I love this school.
I love the kids.
And I feel like I've just gotten started here.
There are some people here who wanna replace me for a man with an awful lot of money and a boy with a good arm.
To those people, I would say you're wrong.
You are dead wrong.
Y'all have a good Saturday.
Stay still, stay still.
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving
Across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away
From the city
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love
Won't wait
Ooh, baby, I love your way
I wanna tell you I love your way every day
I wanna be with you night and day...
You gotta be kidding me.
They offered the job to Wade Aikmen.
All right, now we know.
And, hon...
The board would like to offer you the position of head coach at East Dillon High.
Nobody knows more than I do what to do
Polishing here, wipe off a little there
Car wash
Working at the car wash
At the car wash, baby
Car wash, here we go
Hold her tight, now.
Must have been true
About me and a young girl...
Hello, gorgeous.
This is for you.
Thanks.
I gotta tell you something.
Shoot.
Yesterday, when you were at the auction,
I had this crazy idea in my head that Principal Taylor and my dad...
Just about me going to Vanderbilt and that I can still go.
And so we went to my uncle and I got the money so that I could go, and I'm not gonna go, and I don't wanna go, and I just wanted to say that I'm sorry
that I would even think of doing something like that without talking to you first and I'm not...
Go.
What?
You need to go to Vanderbilt.
I don't wanna go to Vanderbilt.
That's what you want.
Isn't that what you want?
No.
I want you.
Yes, it is.
What I want is to be with you.
Listen to me.
I love you.
I love you, too.
So much.
And this San Antonio State...
No.
You're so much better than that.
So much.
And we know this.
I don't care.
We know this.
And these opportunities, they happen for a reason.
And...
I'm not gonna be that guy to stop you achieving your dreams.
Look, I...
Don't make me be that guy.
Go.
When we dance together
My world's in disguise
It's a thrilling tale that's come true
And when you look at me
With those stars in your eyes
I could waltz across Texas with you
Mustang Sally Come on!
I think you better slow your Mustang down
Mustang Sally
You better slow your Mustang down
But you just keep on running around town, baby
You don't wanna dance?
Not really.
So...
I don't wanna be all Debbie Downer at the wedding or anything, but I've been thinking...
Look, you're going away to college, and you're gonna meet new people and have new experiences, and take different classes and meet a lot of new girls, and...
I don't wanna be that high school couple that has to stay together just to prove everybody wrong and gets in fights all the time over the phone and never sees each other and...
And I love you.
I just think we should break up.
No.
Look, it's not really a yes or no question.
Too bad, 'cause we're not breaking up.
Julie, I love you.
We're gonna be fine.
Come here.
It's gonna be okay.
All right?
All you wanna do is just to ride around
Just to see what?
Ride, Sally, ride
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally
Your grandma would have really liked this wedding.
Yeah, she would.
Hey, Gram.
Matthew, what are you doing here, honey?
Get up.
You're gonna take the curlers out of your hair and then we're gonna go to a wedding, okay?
Now, that's crazy, sweetie.
No, it's not crazy.
Listen.
We're gonna go to a wedding, and then I'm gonna take you home, for good.
Honey, no, you can't do that.
No, I can, no.
Listen, hey.
No, Matthew, honey, no.
You're the only person who's never left me.
I'm not gonna leave you.
Okay?
You mean go back home?
Yeah.
I'm gonna stay here.
My chair.
I'm gonna need my chair.
When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'd trade the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend when she put him down
It's kind of a sucky day, hon.
Well, the rib eye was good.
I don't even know what the hell we're doing here.
I don't even know Billy Riggins that well.
I think they think very highly of us.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hey.
You know what?
Hmm.
No matter what happens, no matter where you go, no matter what you do,
I'm always gonna be behind you.
Always and always and always.
I know that.
I know that.
When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all of his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she says that's the way it's supposed to be
When a man loves a woman
He'd give up everything he has
Trying to hold on to your precious love
So, baby, please don't treat me bad
Okay, look at everybody's...
Come on, there's someplace I wanna go.
There's someplace I wanna go.
Where are you gonna go?
Give me the keys, 'cause I'm driving.
Honey, you're drunk.
Here they come!
Hey, hey, hey.
I need a minute.
I need to talk to you for a second.
Are you kidding me?
No.
I need a minute.
You're an ass.
I know, just give me a minute.
Hey.
What?
What?
Lyla is going to Vanderbilt.
What the hell does that have to do with anything?
I'll tell you what it has to do with.
Everything, Billy.
She was the sole purpose of me going to college.
Now I don't have to go to college.
I'm staying in Dillon is what it means, Billy.
Riggins' Rigs, we're in it together now.
We're gonna be popping beer, making money, getting off early.
No.
I'm telling you, you're not getting it, Billy.
Tim.
What?
Come here.
You listen to me, you little idiot.
You are not gonna wuss out on this.
You're gonna go to college, and you're gonna go get a degree.
And I don't care if it takes you seven years.
All right?
And when you start thinking that it's too hard or that you can't handle it, I want you to remember one thing.
I want you to think about the kids that you don't have yet.
And I want you to think about my kids, me and Mindy's kids that we don't have yet.
And you're gonna get the job done so that one of these days I can tell them that they don't have to settle for second best, and they can be whoever the hell they want to be because their Uncle Timmy went to college.
And God bless our mom and dad, wherever the hell they are.
Yeah.
But we gotta do better by our kids.
Do you hear me?
Tim!
I thought...
Do you hear me?
Yeah.
All right.
I gotta get the hell out of here and go to Puerto Rico.
So don't torch the house.
No promises.
Have fun.
Mom, call me.
Love you.
Kim still hasn't gotten back together with Craig.
Can you believe it, Pearl?
Yeah, if I had a body like hers, i'd be banging everybody I could, too.
Pearl, you must've been a handful.
{\pos(192,230)}I'd like to think I broke up a few happy homes my day.
{\pos(192,230)}
- What's up, Pearl?
- Hi, honey.
{\pos(192,230)}Mom, you forgot to wash my hello Kitty halter top.
I wanted to wear it today.
{\pos(192,230)}No, sorry, Kimmy.
In case you forgot, you promised to do your own laundry I bought you those white lizard boots remember?
I was going to clean the whole house today, but it was going to be a surprise, and you ruined it now, so forget it.
All right, i'll febreze your top as soon as I'm done with Pearl's hair.
That's my cheese casserole.
I'll be back in a Jiff.
Sorry about that, Pearl.
I had a body like yours once.
But with bigger boobs, of course.
Okay, Ginger, come on.
Come here, Ginger, inside.
- Are her paws clean?
- Not super clean, no.
Then no way, Jose.
She can't come in.
I hate to turn away a pregnant dog,
- but no, no.
- Okay well, just tell Kim that we stopped by on the way to the doggy gyno.
- All right.
- Let's go outside girl.
Let's go outside.
Okay, hi.
Mom, I think Pearl fell asleep.
I don't think that's sleeping.

{\pos(192,210)}Did you know that Pearl was my very first paying client?
{\pos(192,200)}You know, my beauty school got in all this trouble for giving out licenses
{\pos(192,210)}willy-manilly, my other customers turned their backs on me.
But not Pearl.
{\pos(192,210)}She stayed true blue.
{\pos(192,210)}
- Sounds like Pearl was a Pearl.
- She was, Phil.
{\pos(192,210)}She had such a big heart.
{\pos(192,210)}Maybe it was fitting that it exploded in her chest.
{\pos(192,210)}I'm so sorry, honey.
Honey, look, there's Roland.
This is the second time he's been in here today.
{\pos(192,210)}I don't know, honey.
I look at him, and I have so many memories.
Bad memories.
That was me.
Switch out the sandwiches for tacos, add a couple of all-butter pound cakes,
{\pos(192,210)}you're looking at a picture of big Phil.
- But you were never that big.
- Bigger.
{\pos(192,210)}And what am I doing now?
I'm just basically loading a gun
{\pos(192,210)}with meat and cheese and aiming it right at his heart.
I'm an enabler.
{\pos(192,230)}I know it's none of my beeswax, but I have half an urge to march
{\pos(192,230)}right over there and put that man a 2,000-calorie die
{\pos(192,230)}with a good strong dose of rigorous, but safe,
{\pos(192,230)}- low-impact aerobic exercise.
- You know what?
You should do it, Phil.
I wasn't able to save Pearl from the grips of death, but you could save Roland.
C'est la vie, Phil.
Seize the day.
Squeeze box, you're making a lot of sense.
I think I heard you crying for help.
Maybe you heard me crying for more sandwich spread.
About seven years ago, a very concerned, and pretty impatient ice cream man urged me to lose the 200 pounds that were standing between me and my true happiness.
And that happiness was that super foxy woman over there in those flamingo pants.
- Okay, I'm in.
- Really?
Just like that?
That was easy.
I haven't had sex in like five years.
- Gotcha.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Would you look at this?
It's half past noon on a tuesday, Kim.
I've already made a fruit salsa from scratch and gone to the funeral home to do Pearl hair.
By the way, that dead hair is very tricky.
It's real flyaway.
All right, I want you to get showered.
Get up.
Let's get the day going.
No, I can't move.
I'm too traumatized over my near-death experience.
With Pearl yesterday.
Kim, you didn't have a near-death experience.
You were near death.
- It's different.
- Mom,
I stared death in the back of the head.
One minute, Pearl was there, and the next minute, she was there, but...
Dead.
- Are you having feelings, Kimmy?
- I think I am.
That's really interesting.
I didn't think you'd give a rat's Tiny "A" about anyone but yourself.
I thought so, too.
But we were wrong.
Hey, dudes.
So, Kim,
I got you something to take your mind off that dead lady.
A shower Cd player!
- Very high-end.
- Very scarface.
Yeah, my financial situation is looking pretty solid, 'cause I got a bunch of advance deposit money for Ginger's puppies.
- How much you going to get?
- The vet says she's jammed full of puppies.
There's like ten of them in there.
So the going rate for Rotts is like $1,000 a dog.
So do the math.
It's...
It's $10,000.
I'm going to go install this.
Kim, you have got to tell Craig that Ginger was involved in a gang-banging.
I can't do that right now.
I am too upset over Pearl.
All right, but you're gonna give the Cd player back then.
- I'm already used to it.
- Kim, you're giving it back.
It's awesome.
I don't want the Cd player.
You'll have to return it.
What?
Wh...
is it 'cause I made you do math?
I changed my mind.
I'm allowed.
It's a woman's "pejormative."
You know what?
You're right.
I come in with this lame-o shower Cd player, thinking that listening tunes all wet is going to make you forget about death.
Of course it's not.
My dad was right, man.
I don't think about things.
I'm really hungry.
She's making food now.
Is there going to be food?
I'm really hungry.
Sure, she's making food now.
You go on in.
I'm going to pick a flower for milady.
Holy Moly "Pajoly"!
That sky opened up like a car wash.
Should've got my wheels waxed.
Florida.
What can you do?
It's a small price for living in paradise, honey.
- Do I smell lentils?
- What's a lentil?
Prepare to be delighted.
Now, this is a delicious, low-fat, low-salt, low-calorie vegetable couscous with a wonderful cheese alternative.
I smell pizza.
You're having a phantom aroma.
I smelled brownies for about a year.
- Is that a phantom pizza?
- Kim, What are you doing?
You do not bring a delicious three-cheese pizza into a house with a dieting person.
But it's helping me through my rough time.
Roland, keep your eyes on me.
Roland, I'm over here.
Bring your eyes this way.
There you go.
Now, what you're... no, Roland, give me your eyes right here.
Roland, let me see your eyes.
I don't have him, Kath.
I lost him.
Come on!
Hi, honey.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I put Roland on the scale down at the recycling center.
Guess what?
He lost four pounds.
And we got 12 bucks back on our bottles and cans.
That's wonderful news on both ends.
Earl grey... very high-end.
I know it's neither the time nor the place to feel anything like glee.
But I'm telling you, honey, I am so jazzed to the max about the difference i'm making in that man's life.
Phil, well, I'm jazzed that you're jazzed.
Hey, where's Kim?
She couldn't come because she's in mourning.
But I think we should go pay our respects.
All right.
That tea needs to steep for six minutes anyway.
Well, good-bye, Pearl.
- She's in a better place, honey.
- Her hair.
They changed it.
This isn't the style I gave her.
Pearl wouldn't be caught dead in bangs.
See there.
Now there's a funeral person.
I'm going to go talk to him.
Excuse me.
It seems that the deceased's hair has been tampered with.
Judith, our in-house beautician, does all the hair.
But I came by yesterday and styled it, as per the wishes of the deceased.
The family purchased package "B."
That includes casket, embalming, hair, makeup, and refreshments.
But her hair looks terrible.
Well, I think that's a little harsh, don't you?
Judith worked in tampa for many years.
She knows what she's doing.
And between you and me, it doesn't matter.
Excuse me.
I think it does matter.
Hair was very important to Pearl, especially as it pertained to the hereafter.
Yes.
Well, if you'll excuse me, please.
Put that comb away and follow me to the door, please!
Big deal tampa.
- Hey, baby.
How you feeling?
- Pretty devastated and stuff.
So, I was up all night last night racking my brains trying to think of something to buy you to cheer you up.
And
- I totally nailed it.
- I don't want anything, Craig.
I know.
And it felt really weird saying it, too.
That's a bummer, 'cause there's something really expensive outside for you.
But I mean, if you don't want it I could give it to someone else.
You know what I mean?
A boat?
!
For me?
!
Baby... that is not a "boat."
That...
Is a 180 challenger, special edition.
With a rotax 1503 fuel-injected power plant, with close-looped cooling system, and full fiberglass stringer.
- How'd you afford it?
- Puppy money, dude.
I already put a deposit on it and everything, baby.
I am just beyond the beyond about Pearl's hair.
I have to get it back to its normal status, before it's too late.
Kitten, what are you going to do?
- You looked so good out there.
- I know.
I thought you were upstairs mourning.
Craig made me go out with him, to cheer me up.
- I pretty much bought Kim a boat.
- You bought her a boat?
A boat.
Well, permission to board, sir.
I'm a bit of a salty dog myself.
Argh, matey.
- Argh, matey.
- Yeah, sure, Pete.
- What was that voice?
- That's a pirate.
Don't say a word.
I cannot believe that you were out there sailing away, like Christopher Cross, when you could've been visiting Pearl.
We didn't even put it in the water.
We just drove it around.
I didn't want to get my hair wet.
Kim, you are coming with me to the funeral home tomorrow.
And you going to visit Pearl, and pay your respects.
And then keep watch, while I redo her hair.
Or I am telling Craig about the mutts.
All of them.
I'm serious, Kim.
Fine.
I'll go with you.
Why are you so obsessed about Pearl's hair, anyway?
Well Kim, hair was very important to Pearl.
And Pearl was very important to me.
We had a lot in common, Pearl and i.
We were both single moms.
We've both carved out modest livings for ourselves as small business owners.
Not to mention the fact that neither our daughters gives a flying fig about us.
I give a fig.
Like, I wouldn't let you be buried in bangs.
You wouldn't?
You look gross in bangs.
Thank you, Kim.
- Is Phil here yet?
- No, he won't be in for an hour.
Good.
Look, I called in an order.
- Let me check.
- Thank you.
{\pos(192,230)}I was just about to leave.
They said you wouldn't be in for a while.
{\pos(192,230)}I had to come early, talk to my bread broker.
{\pos(192,230)}Bread broker, cool.
All right.
Well, I guess i'll see you later?
- All right.
Okay, great.
- Here you go.
You.
I'm going to do some serious damage to these sandwiches.
Listen to me.
Dieting is hard.
Nobody knows that better than I do.
I'm telling you that you have got to work through the temptation.
Because what's on the other side Roland, is something that's so, so special.
No, I'm just going to eat.
If you choose to eat those sandwiches, you are officially eighty-sixed from this island.
Okay, just going to eat.
Scissors, check.
Combs, check.
Scrunchies, check.
Shampoo, in case there's time, check.
I don't know going get Pearl's head in the sink, due to the Rigors of Mortis.
All right.
Let's go, Kim.
No, I told Craig i'd stay with Ginger, in case she goes into labor.
- So I can't go.
Sorry.
- Come on.
- She's nowhere near giving birth.
- Really?
How can you tell?
Because I had a baby, that's how.
She doesn't have the look.
Her paws aren't swollen at all.
Though I will tell you, she's going to need a good bra after all this.
Just put her in the garage.
I have a gorgeous warm bean salad sitting on the counter, and I do not want her getting into it.
Come on.
Let's go.
It's Phyllis chillers in here.
Excuse me...
Excuse me, hello.
I am looking for a ms.
Pearl schmidt.
- I believe Pearl's gone.
- I'm well aware of that.
Thank you.
But I just need to speak to the body, privately please.
- No, the body is gone.
- What?
- What did they do with her?
- They buried her this morning.
It was a private burial, i'm sorry.
Okay, let's go.
I didn't even get to say goodbye to her.
And with her hair all banged up like that.
I'm going to go.
Pearl... i'm so sorry.
But she was a bit of a homewrecker.
Jeez, but everyone makes mistakes.
Pearl, wherever you are!
Pearl, I Miss you so much.
Look over here!
It's so unusual!
- Different!
- Very feminine!
Sexy!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Craig would love this one.
Can we get it for him?
It's very rock'n roll!
Look at this one for me!
I love the leopard.
I don't know.
I'd have to see you in it.
Do you think it's too matchy?
Shame on the island.
What the sam hill?
Shame on the island.
Shame on the island.
This is not good for business.
Shame on the island.
I don't know why you needed a $1,500 casket.
- You have expensive taste, missy.
- I want to be comfy.
What's that moaning?
Kim, come here, dude.
Me and Ginger are in the white room.
The white room?
!
Hey, her paws are clean, but I'm not so sure about the afterbirth junk, man.
She is in full on labor, yo.
Doggy labor in the white room!
I'm not even allowed to have drinks in here.
Craig, you got to get her out of here.
Come on.
Please?
They don't make this pile carpeting anymore.
I can't move her, she's giving birth right now.
For goodness sake.
Kim, go get towels.
Hurry.
And not the good ones with the sea shells.
Go, go.
Is that a puppy?
Listen to me.
I was one of you!
These were my pants!
I couldn't wear these pants.
They were small on me.
Please tell them I was one of them.
Please, Roland.
Can't we just talk?
Over a sandwich?
Hang in there, champ.
Come here.
You kind of stink, girl.
Kim, you've got to tell him that there are no purebred Rottweilers
- coming out of Ginger.
- I don't know.
I feel bad.
- I mean, he got me a boat.
- Well, you need to prepare him.
Let me tell you something, when I was pregnant with you, your dad desperately wanted a boy.
And I knew by my cravings for beer and salty foods, that it was a girl, but I didn't tell him.
And guess what?
When you came out, he was destroyed.
I mean ruined, Kim.
- Is that why he left?
- No.
I mean...
He said it was something.
Maybe a tiny little part of the reason.
- But the whole reason why he left...
- Something's happening, you guys.
It's a cross between beautiful and gross.
- I want to cry and vomit.
- Tell him.
Craig, my dad wanted a boy.
Okay, here we go.
We are going to be rich, baby!
- More sandwich spread?
- What do you think?
Roland, I really owe you an apology.
You know, my mother spent my entire childhood trying to keep me on a strict diet.
And I mean she did everything.
From hiding food in a locked closet, to putting me on some very aggressive, and equally dangerous experimental diets.
And I'd be lying if I told you some of them didn't involve public nudity.
The point is, none of them worked.
Because I wasn't ready to change.
And I was doing the same thing to you.
And I really, really am sorry.
It's all right.
I mean look, if you didn't butt into my life,
I would've never protested your store,
I would've never met sassy over there.
She's fat hot.
Nice.
She's very nice.
We're still in that kind of beginning stage.
Real hot and heavy.
She is insatiable.
- Sex-wise.
- Food-wise.
{\pos(192,230)}I guess what hurts the most is that I can't trust you.
{\pos(192,230)}Like, ever.
I mean, it was me and you, dude.
{\pos(192,230)}So is what I want to know, how could you do this to me?
I mean, how could you live with yourself?
Craig, leave her alone.
She's been through enough.
I mean, how did this happen?
- I don't know.
- Well, what am I going to do?
Because I have spent a lot of money that I now do not have.
I can't even look at you.
I can't even look at her.
Leave her alone!
Why are you, out of all people, defending her?
'Cause I know what it's like to have a checkers past.
- Why don't you just leave?
- Okay, you know what?
I am going to go.
Because honestly, Ginger...
I don't know what our next step is.
You have changed everything.
It will never be the same, ever.
I'm not even going to look at you ever again!
You know?
I think what we just saw is the cycle of life.
Pearl died here, and ten mutts were born.
I want to name this one Pearl.
What?
Defending Ginger?
Naming a dog after Pearl?
I'm becoming very confused by you having feelings.
I know.
Right?
Florida.
You are a fickle mistress.
- What's that?
- Rainbow sherbet.
I stopped by 32 flavors.
That sounds refreshing.
Did you get me one?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you wanted any.
Kim, who wouldn't want a herbert on a hot day?
- Can I have a little taste?
- I don't think there's enough.
Just a tiny, tiny taste.
- Beepy deepy beepy deepy!
- My daughter's so generous.
Lucky you're getting any, "ingrade."
Team Subs-Addicts"
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
- [Man] We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted. - [Whistles]
[Michael Narrating] When you're burned, you've got nothing... no cash, no credit, no job history.
- You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you...
- [Laughs]
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?
An old friend who used to inform on you to the F.B. I...
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.
- Family too...
- Hey, is that your mom again?
- If you're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.
Bottom line:
As long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
[Michael Narrating] Nobody wants to hear from a burned spy.
Your old handlers send your calls straight to voice mail.
Your appeals are filed in the trash.
Your old contacts are worthless.
Your best bet is to find an active field operative who can't hang up on you.
If you're on domestic soil, the airport's not a bad place to look.
Intelligence agencies are like amateur magicians.
Watch closely, and you can see how they set up their tricks.
It doesn't matter how good they are at misdirection and sleight of hand.
They can't make a covert ops supply plane disappear.
Four-U-M-Y-three-one-four.
Oh, Mikey.
You just wrecked the most amazing dream.
All these beautiful nachos were coming right... 4-U-M-Y-3-1-4.
Runway 3.
No flight plan, no problem?
Yep, and it's not a drug plane.
Had clearance from the tower.
- It's got to be a black flight.
- [Sighs]
Bringing toys to all the good little spooks in Latin America.
Mike, please tell me this means I can go back to sleep alone in my own bed.
Is that how you celebrate these days, Sam?
Say it ain't so.
[Laughs]
Fi.
Wow, you look...
Like I'm ready for lunch at the Delano.
I thought after a week of you eating fast food in the car with Sam... that you might like to take me.
I can't today.
I found a spy plane.
I got the tail number.
Why do you use that shot for fake I.D.'s?
It's like a bad prom picture.
I need to get some records from the F.A.A.
You need a driver's lic...
I think it makes me look trustworthy.
But I need to find out who owns the plane, who flies it, who registered it.
One of those people might be able to pull some strings, get me back in.
- And you have to find them immediately?
- Well, there's...
There's no time like the present.
It's time for Duane Winger to make his move.
Great.
I'm going to lunch.
Have fun getting your job back.
I know you don't like what I'm doing.
But you know it's not just about the job.
- You know that, right?
- Right.
It's about patriotism and duty.
And the sacred call of... whatever.
I was told that hell on earth would rain down on me without an umbrella.
I don't know, Duane.
Looks pretty sunny out there to me.
I'm gonna enjoy it.
- [Door Opens, Closes]
- Prom picture?
[Computer Beeps]
Here we go, Mr. Winger.
The plane you're asking about is owned by Executransport, Ltd.
Want to write it down?
You can borrow my pen.
[Southern Accent] How about you pull the whole file?
- Could I borrow that?
- Oh, you're bad.
We can't sign files out.
Everything back here is "look but don't touch."
That is a shame.
I'm gonna level with you.
I'm a P.I. Workin' a messy divorce.
Sleazebag hubby's hidin' a jet under a shell company.
One little copy sure would help.
[Man On P.A.] Inspector Foster to Hangar 5.
It'd be our little secret, Miss...
Linda.
[Man On P.A.] Will Duane Winger please report to Reception?
Duane Winger to Reception, please.
The guy just wanted a file.
What's the big deal?
[Man] The big deal is I just got a call from the deputy director.
That file was red flagged.
[Michael Narrating] When you get cornered, there's a rush of adrenaline... as the fight-or-flight response kicks in.
In those moments, you can't listen to your body.
There are some circumstances when flight just isn't the right option.
Fortunately, with a little training and the right kind of hitch knot... all that adrenaline can make you capable of something pretty close to flight.
Doesn't help the landing though.
Barry wanted a thousand dollars just to look into the company that owned that plane?
Yeah.
Sorry, man.
He said to get the articles of incorporation... he's got to go up to the capital.
- [Gunshots]
- What, is he taking a cab to Tallahassee?
Barry?
No.
His mom is up there, so he's gotta see her.
The grand is like an annoyance tax.
- Fair enough.
- [Laughs]
It'll be money well spent, Mikey.
You track down the spooks that are flying that plane... get 'em to call in a few favors, you might not be stuck in Miami that much longer.
And you won't have to buy me drinks after range practice.
Subtle, Sam.
That's me, Mike.
See the olive?
Not that I'm complaining, but where's Fi?
It's not like her to skip our little ritual...
- use any chance to pop off a few rounds.
- She wasn't too thrilled...
Hey, you!
Hey, you!
You in the sunglasses!
Hey, can I see that gun?
[Grunting]
- Careful there.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- [Whispering] I promise I won't hurt you.
- Oh, that's good.
- It's you.
I knew you existed.
- Who are you?
My name is Spencer.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I had to make sure it was you.
He's the guy, right?
He's some kind of special ops guy.
[Michael Narrating] There are times in any spy's career when someone...
- somehow figures out who you are.
- I really need your help.
Usually the best approach is to just put on a good poker face and deny everything.
- I think you have the wrong idea.
- No.
No, no, no, no.
L-I've been...
I've been monitoring the paper... certain items in the blotter...
and crime rates, police band chatter.
- And it all adds up.
It becomes very clear.
- Not yet it doesn't.
No, the pattern...
There's a pattern.
Y-You don't just have, oh, oh, hello... a series of controlled explosions here and a dip in violent crime there.
You have to ask yourself, "What is the connection?
Who is the connection?"
So I think to myself, "We're not talking about Spider-Man."
We're talking about a real guy who has to practice.
So I did a Fermi estimate, and I got 63% odds that he lives... within a five-mile radius of this gun range, so...
Once you see a pattern, you can't unsee it.
So you've been staking out the shooting range looking for...
You.
And your gun.
And your skills.
And...
And that thing that you did with the...
where you...
All that seems to confirm to me that you are the guy.
No, no.
You have to help me.
You're the guy.
What can I say?
I'm not the guy.
That's a lie.
You lied.
Very convincingly, as any trained operative would.
Listen.
You have to help me.
I don't want to make you, but I will if I have to.
Okay.
He's an operative!
This guy!
Very famous.
He's a rogue agent...
special operatives guy.
Okay, okay, fine.
We're gonna talk.
Boy, are we gonna talk.
He's the spy.
So who are you?
Uh, no offense, Spencer, but who are you?
Oh, I'm a mathematician.
M.I.T.
- Did my doctoral work at Duke.
- You were saying you need help?
About a year ago I started to work at Stone Kittredge.
They do a lot of government contracts...
construction, energy, tech.
Yeah, it's a defense firm.
We know 'em.
Well, I've seen some things there that I shouldn't have.
One of their vice presidents is a... well, a killer.
Okay, is this just some kind of a joke?
She's killed three already.
It's gonna happen again soon.
In Malaysia, if I had to guess.
[Sam] Malaysia?
I'm not sure what's going on here, but do you have proof of something?
Not exactly, but how do you explain this?
I used my friend Brad's workstation to do some digging around in the system.
Two days later, the gas line at Brad's house blew up, and he was burned to death.
They thought he was onto them, so they killed my friend.
Calm down.
Let's back it up, Spencer.
Why were you using Brad's computer?
L-I don't have a computer at the office.
I'm...
I take care of the plants at Stone Kittredge.
- Ah.
There it is.
- I am too busy for a full-time job, okay?
Do you have any idea how many messages I have to decode every day?
Hundreds.
Do you think beings that advanced sleep?
I'm sorry. "Beings"?
Oh, oh.
Would you like me to say "aliens"?
The bad ones are from a nearby star system...
Procyon "A."
They-They take our form.
They encode their messages in beams of light.
Gorgeous mathematics wrapped around deadly messages.
But the Guardians... they are from a planet that orbits around Ross 154.
And-And they are being hunted.
Three of them are dead already.
- Every minute that we waste...
- Okay.
All right.
Just calm down a little bit here.
No, damn it!
There is no time!
Spencer, calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Uh, there's something I need right over here.
Sit down.
Sorry.
He started talking about aliens...
Uh, crazy stuff.
He thought I was a spy.
- You know, like James Bond or something.
- [Both Chuckle]
- And you guys sure you don't wanna file a report?
- Oh, no, no, no.
We just didn't want to see the guy hurt himself or anybody else.
Those are the magic words every time this guy goes to court.
- Oh, so he's been in before?
- Oh, yeah.
Dispatch told us that Mr. Watkowski here... has been in and out of the psych ward for the past four years.
Big-time schizo.
Sad stuff, but, guys, thanks.
Appreciate your help, all right?
- Take care.
- Well, if you're looking for a silver lining... it's nice to know that we can still call the cops, huh?
- Can't believe he found me, Sam.
- [Laughs]
Don't worry, Mike.
Most people can't decode the secrets... hidden in beams of light.
I don't know about you, but I could use that drink now.
[Michael Narrating] A money launderer's natural habitat... is near rich people.
What they save by avoiding taxes... they usually spend on overpriced drinks.
But meeting with them is never boring.
Jesus.
Mike.
[Chuckles] Hi.
"Meet me at the Chadwick.
I'm poolside.
Bring cash."
This text doesn't even have a smiley face.
What happened to my friend Barry?
Hey, you know I don't like charging you, but that was a big favor.
I go up north, I gotta stay with my mom.
She's still mad at me I dropped out of podiatry school.
Makes me nuts.
Anyway, I needed to unwind.
The view here helps... a lot.
- [Whistles, Snaps] Barry.
- Oh.
Okay.
Executransport, Ltd.
You're probably not gonna be shocked to hear that it's a shell company... and its registrants don't even exist.
Officially speaking, nobody owns the plane you saw.
- Not shocked, no.
- But it wasn't a total dead end though.
There's a real business tied to that plane?
North Andes Distribution.
They got a hangar over at the airport.
Probably packed the cargo on the very flight you saw.
Not bad, Barry.
Hey, listen, before you go, uh, you help me out here, Mike?
Do my back?
Hey, Mike.
Look who's back.
Hey, man.
Hey.
I'm so sorry to bother you at home, especially after...
I shouldn't have done that.
[Chuckles] The table.
Your new friend was just explaining that he hacked the D.M. V... and found your place thanks to a parking ticket, of all things.
- He's really very clever.
- So... they let you out?
Well, they may as well have.
The nurses at that place... don't even disguise the pattern of the rounds, and the locks there are child's play.
Oh, there's no hard feelings.
I know you were just testing me.
Spencer, you can't be here.
You're right.
We shouldn't be out in the open like this.
They're probably looking for me.
- The aliens?
- The police.
I broke out of a psych ward.
Weren't you listening?
Spencer, we can't do anything for you.
I know people think my mind's not right, but I am right.
I'm right about this.
They killed my friend Brad.
Please, just let me show you what I learned.
Hey, I found you, didn't I?
He doesn't seem that crazy to me.
All right, show us.
Okay.
I was wrong.
He's totally nuts.
Sorry about the...
Oh, there's something I really need to show you in the paper.
I can't find anything in this mess.
Yeah, sometimes I lose track of things when I leave them on the ceiling.
Ha!
No, that's...
Oh, okay, we can start there.
This is the one I was telling you about.
Three killed in the past four months.
- Just like I said.
- You said aliens.
- This looks like American spies.
- Well, the forms they take vary, but...
You're saying these men were outed by an executive at Stone Kittredge?
- Yes, that's what I'm saying.
- [Sam] Wait a second.
Ronald Papa?
They said this was a climbing accident.
Mike, this guy was a friend of mine.
I mean, I worked with him.
Oh, oh, good.
So you worked with one of the Guardians.
No, don't do that.
I just sent flowers to Ron's wife... last month, so don't be making up stories about real people.
Oh, I'm not.
I lost a friend too.
My friend Brad.
The one they killed to cover it up.
The one I told you about.
See, you have to...
You just have to read all these.
Please, just read them all.
Spencer, these are just a bunch of newspaper articles.
Oh, no, there's a pattern.
You have to see the pattern.
It's all connected.
There's a galactic war between these...
the bad ones...
The ones from Procyon "A'" are hunting the Guardians.
And guys like Brad who get in the middle...
they'll kill them.
And then the darkness will come.
Unless you...
It's up to you to stop them.
Spencer, I know this guy.
He's a good guy.
He's a good doctor.
I want you to meet him.
[Michael Narrating] Whether you're infiltrating a cartel... or spiking a chemical weapons sale, the most dangerous people in any covert op... are the ones on your side.
If they crack, you end up in a shallow grave.
That's usually a good enough reason to avoid working with crazy people.
Mike.
Michael.
"Diplomat Found Dead in Malaysia."
[Michael Narrating] But sometimes you have no choice.
Oh, that's the one, see?
It's like I told you.
It's today's paper.
It happened just like he said it would.
Mike, if aliens equal spies...
- What's wrong?
- Spencer, I was really hoping you were just crazy.
##[Pop]
[Man] # Yeah ##
[Sam] Okay, let me get this straight.
2007, Stone Kittredge gets the contract... to provide secure communications between American embassies.
So they do the usual firewall crap, plus they come up with a code.
- Called Zydeco, yes.
- Okay, and you think somebody there... is intercepting these encrypted e-mails... and selling the names of American spies...
that's your bogus theory?
What these Procyon beings are really doing is exposing the Guardians from Ross 154.
Right.
Like my buddy Ronnie.
But how do you know it's somebody inside of Stone Kittredge... and not some whack-job on the outside who just cracked the code?
- Uh, that's absurd. [Laughs]
- Absurd... like "aliens are sending me messages through the PennySaver" absurd?
[Spencer] Zydeco's unbreakable.
It's a four-kilobyte code.
4K?
Mike, I got pictures of Miss Reynolds on my phone bigger than that.
No, an algorithmic code that takes up four kilobytes of space is beyond secure.
It would take longer than the whole life of the universe to crack it.
That...
That's impossible.
Th-There's no way.
You'd really...
- You'd really need the code to read those messages.
- All right, fine.
Relax.
Maybe there's another way that we can do this.
- Will you sit down?
- No, no.
There she is.
That's her.
In the black.
That's Shannon Park.
Her team created Zydeco.
[Michael] Think she kept a copy?
Yeah, and I know she has access to the embassy e-mail system.
That much I saw myself.
That's how my friend Brad got killed.
She thought he was onto her.
No, I'm telling you...
She's a murderer and a traitor.
And you can see how she takes our form.
But I swear, she's an alien.
Let's stick to Earth problems.
We need to look at Shannon's files.
If she has an unauthorized copy of Zydeco, we can get her busted.
No, y-you can't get into her system.
It's Fort Knox.
No, l-l-I tried to get in remotely and I couldn't do it.
We hit her office.
We bury a keystroke tracking program.
Come back the next day for her password.
We get the e-mails and the code.
[Laughs] No, no.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh, but she's...
No, look, these are very advanced beings.
She'd be able to tell if you were on her computer.
L-I think she's a little out of your league.
Okay, Mr. Computer.
Is she out of your league?
[Michael] We need you to get us access at Stone Kittredge, Spencer.
Jeremy Dresner, consulting in I.T.
There should be a visitor badge in the system for me.
[Michael Narrating] In medieval Europe... spies used to pose as lepers and plague victims... so they could snoop around without being bothered.
In today's corporate office, posing as I. T. Works the same way.
It's the perfect cover if you need to linger without being bothered.
And it gives you a pretext for talking to almost anyone.
Miss Park.
Jeremy Dresner, I.T., Alexandria office.
I need to speak with you.
- Great.
Make an appointment.
- No problem.
How about now?
Excuse me?
We're doing an internal audit of security procedures.
I have the paperwork right here.
We were told your whole department... would be cooperative, Ms. Park.
Well, that's funny, Jeremy.
'Cause I'm the head of this department... and nobody's said word one to me.
Well, here I am, and we're way past word one now.
Security is our business on this wing.
Your business is installing software upgrades.
So I suggest you have somebody up on 14 give me a call about this...
- and I suggest they send somebody else next time.
- Oh, I bet they will.
I bet they'll send you up to see me, Shannon.
I'm looking forward to it.
Can I borrow your bathroom key?
[Whispering] You're my hero.
[Michael Narrating] All you need to beat a modern tumbler lock... is a little information and some Stone Age tools.
If you know the basic type of key you need to spoof, pick out a matching blank... file down the valleys to the center ledge... and you have a bump key.
Apply torque, whack it with anything handy, and you're in.
Not quite as much fun as kicking a door down.
You ready to go?
To dinner?
It's 4:30.
I told you, no more early-bird specials.
Yeah, I thought we would stop by the airport first...
- pay a visit to that front business Barry found.
- More spy hunting?
Michael, why must everything you do revolve around getting your old job back?
- Fiona, really.
This is important.
- Oh, Michael, come on.
I'll do it alone.
We're gonna have to do this eventually.
Yeah.
Just not right now.
[Door Closes]
[Michael Narrating] Drug cartels aren't the only organizations... who use import-export businesses as fronts.
Intelligence agencies like them because... they make it possible for missions to finance themselves.
Who parked that gray truck out there?
Where's your boss?
They send out guns and supplies and get back goods to sell.
Native antiquities are favorites... because their subjective prices make money laundering easy.
You the manager?
No, Mr. Westen.
I'm Diego Garza.
I'm the spy you're looking for.
You're really not supposed to tell people you're a spy.
What's the point in subterfuge?
All the memos they send from D.C., they say you're very, very good.
I have to assume you're here because you want back in.
Trying to reach out?
I like you, Diego.
You're doing all the work for me.
I don't want this to hurt your feelings... but I'd really like you to get the hell out of here.
Not everything they told you about me is true.
Well, the part about me being really, really good, but...
I just want to talk to your bosses so we can clear this up.
[Sighs, Laughs] I wish it was that simple.
I have 20 years at the Company.
I've seen villages burned.
I've seen children orphaned.
I've been shot twice.
Then they transferred me here.
Now, you know what the hardest part of this job is?
That forklift turns funny.
Now, if I report back that I made contact with a burned spy...
- do you know where they'll send me?
- [Hisses]
Me neither.
And I'm not rocking this boat.
I'm giving you a chance to be a friend.
Mr. Westen, I don't like threats.
But I love your sunglasses.
[Chuckles] You have a good one, okay?
[Michael Narrating] Doing a job in broad daylight... means easier access but more witnesses.
You can walk right in with your unwanted audience... but you better have a plan to entertain them.
Well, all right, ladies and gentlemen.
If I can borrow your attention, I promise to return it in about an hour.
My name is Charles Finley.
You can call me Charles.
[Laughs] I know.
I'm the dreaded teamwork consultant that popped up on your calendar there.
So, come on, everybody.
Follow me into the conference room right now.
Let's go.
- [Employees Muttering]
- There's gonna be ice cream cake.
It's my birthday.
Let's go.
Come on.
Did I mention ice cream cake?
Come on, folks.
Come on.
Break free from your cubicle, huh?
That's the ticket.
Whoa, ho!
They warned me about you, Ms. Park.
- I don't have time for this.
- Oh, now, come on, boss lady.
Let's be a good example for everybody, huh?
What do you say?
Hey, folks.
Let's do this thing.
[Chuckling]
[Chuckling Continues]
Have they all been taken?
Yeah, to the conference room.
Next chapter is entitled "Talk to Me:
Enhancing Your Empowerment Sphere."
Let's make this quick.
- [Groans]
- Has anyone here heard of the Seventh Sigma?
This is the newest commandment in the business bible, people.
Anyone?
- Todd.
- "Thou shalt not lie about ice cream cake"?
[Laughs] Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, Todd.
You're a joker, Todd.
You're gonna stay after class.
See, that's all...
Do you see that?
That encryption is Zydeco.
Those are all...
She shouldn't have those.
Those are all coded e-mails she's stealing.
Yeah, I was right.
Okay, Spencer.
I can't send a page of numbers to the F.B.I. I need the code.
- Oh, I don't like this.
- Does she have it or not?
No, I don't see it.
Look though.
Look at this.
She wiped all her bank records within 24 hours of accessing the system.
Here.
Here again.
Every time she...
Spencer...
Spencer, I need you to focus.
There's no point in her intercepting the e-mails if she can't decrypt them.
No, no...
Listen.
Every time there's a payment...
Yesterday, today... twice.
Oh, she sent two more names out.
Oh, I don't know where it's gonna happen next.
I don't know who's gonna die.
Two more, but...
Spencer, it's gonna be fine if you find the code.
Right now.
No, I told you.
It's not here.
She's too careful.
She must borrow the copy they keep in the SCI F room and put it back when she's done.
- Oh, God.
I should have seen it.
- Wait.
Now you're telling me that her copy of the code is in a SCI F room?
- That's a vault.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- The pattern...
I didn't see it.
I didn't see any of this.
- Get out of the chair!
[Typing]
Which brings us to the Finley Method...
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Are you leaving us?
- I have work to do.
- Folks, be right back.
Turn to page seven.
Hey, hey.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey.
Shannon...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey...
- I'm sending myself a copy of everything encrypted.
- Let's go.
- Let's hit the reset button.
Do it together.
Hit the button.
Let's reset the clock here.
No, no...
We have to take the machines.
No, we have to take the machines.
- We have to find the names.
She could have buried it.
- Spencer!
No, we have to warn the Guardians.
No, we have to.
The darkness will come.
The darkness will come.
You'll see...
You'll look up.
The stars will go out.
And every night... every night...
We can be positive, Shannon.
This is all about us...
- Team.
I. We.
- [Whispers] That's enough.
[Sam] Shannon, you're killing me here.
Oh, come on.
Enough.
Come on, Spencer.
Come on.
They're all gonna die.
We don't have the code.
They're all gonna die.
I could...
I'll try to hack into Shannon's computer again remotely.
Yeah, if I leave the line open, maybe I can catch her when she uses the code.
You can't.
If you get caught, she can trace where you live and...
She sent more names.
We don't know who or where, but we know they're gonna die.
And those files you stole from her computer are useless without a copy of Zydeco.
- Well, that's not true.
We can use...
- There's no point in trying.
No, there's no use in even a... in even a...
even attempting to break that code.
You understand?
The whole life of the universe.
- Listen.
Please...
- I know you're trying to help, but if you think... you can break into the SCIF room to steal that code...
No, I'm sorry.
That's never gonna happen.
- You see, there's a nine-digit keypad and...
- I'm not going to...
Shannon and her friends from Procyon "A" won't just sit back and watch.
[Exhales]
Spencer, Michael isn't going to decrypt... the e-mails that Shannon stole.
He's going to use them as a prop to scare her.
No, I don't see that.
[Inhales, Exhales]
We're gonna convince her that someone's hunting for the leak.
She'll stop selling names, cover her tracks.
We'll tip the F.B.I. When she goes to erase the SCIF room's access code.
She'll be arrested.
No more spies die.
There's justice for your friend.
The alien goes to jail.
Oh, well, that sounds good.
Is that what you were gonna say?
If you wanna keep your job, keep walking and keep your voice down.
- And act casual.
- We don't have a Jeremy Dresner in Virginia.
I checked.
Who are you and...
The people we both work for don't know my name, and neither will you.
I'm the guy cleaning up your mess.
That's all you get.
What mess?
Two days ago, you were an I.T. Guy.
Two days ago, I was shaking the tree.
There's a leak coming from Tech.
That's your department.
We're staring down the barrel of a federal case and a massive P.R. Disaster.
Zydeco's compromised.
Three American operatives are already dead.
This is ridiculous.
I don't know who you are.
- I'm calling my boss.
- Go ahead.
Use mine... if you'd rather deal with a massive federal investigation.
Shannon, the feds are just sniffing at this now.
We got two days.
After that, your stock options won't be worth the paper they're printed on.
This doesn't make any sense.
That embassy system is airtight.
Zydeco was my project.
Believe me, honey, I know it was.
Where did you get that?
I need you to call upstairs, cancel all your appointments for the day.
There's something I need you to see.
Two weeks ago, I get a call from one of our employers.
One of your programmers in your department got himself blown up.
Brad Wilkins?
They asked me to have a look.
- Cops said that was an accident.
- Yeah.
Miami-Dade detectives make 56 grand a year.
How much do you think I make?
They didn't even know about this boat.
Your boy Brad had it registered under his mother's name.
- He was careful... just not careful enough.
- Where'd he get those?
That's what we're trying to find out.
Try to keep up, honey.
Notes in the margins.
Now, I learned about the leak because Brad found out about the leak.
He was hunting them.
Why he didn't share this news, I don't know.
- But he sure did get himself killed.
- What do the notes say?
He wanted to look at the SCI F access logs.
- Now I do.
- That's eyes only.
I'm not gonna show you that.
You absolutely will.
Tomorrow is Saturday.
There'll be nobody in the office.
You will meet me here at 10:00 so I know you're clean, then we go have a show-and-tell.
[Michael Narrating] Cell phones are basically wireless computers.
- What is this?
- Upload the right program... and you've got a roving bug you can turn on remotely.
You will keep that on you.
If you need to talk to me before tomorrow morning... you will use that, not the office, not the home phone.
Last person who looked into this leak was killed.
You never know who's listening.
- What if we're not the only ones in the office?
- Tomorrow morning.
No excuses.
You be here.
[Static]
We don't know who's listening.
- Guess we're up and running.
- 10 by 10.
Hey, how'd Virgil's boat work out?
Did I ever tell you about the marlin we caught off of Pigeon Key?
Yeah, a few times.
Hey, do you mind keeping an ear on Shannon tonight?
I gotta head down to the airport, see if I can't motivate our pal Diego.
[Michael Narrating] Front companies generally make easy targets for burglary.
They don't want people wondering what they have to hide... so they tend not to install a lot of lights, alarms and security cameras.
And, of course, they'd never invite the police in to investigate... so there's really no need to be shy about leaving clues.
[Sam On Phone] But you got to admit, it's elegant.
We catch Shannon wiping the access log tonight, and she goes to jail.
It's not the crime, it's the cover-up.
[Fiona] I understand the plan.
I just don't like it.
I wish we could forget about this "Catch her in the act, call the feds" nonsense... and drive to her house right now and finish this properly.
I should be home in bed right now.
Hey, hey, don't be dozing' off out there.
Freakin' amateur hour around here.
- [Static, Line Rings]
- Yeah...
Hold on.
Yeah, it's Shannon.
Find it?
10437 Crest, right?
Sure you wanna do this?
I don't know.
You wanna get the needle?
I told you...
There's heat on me at work.
An I.P. Address at that location tried to hack me... some nut from the office.
I am not taking chances.
We gotta tie this up cleanly.
You cannot be around...
I put a timer underneath the house.
Same as Brad.
Goes off at midnight.
I'll be long gone by then.
- Good.
Then get off the phone.
- [Phone Beeps]
Fi, did you hear that?
Spencer stuck his neck out, and she caught him.
Yeah.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to Spencer's.
I'm gonna have to leave the front door open here.
- What if she comes to wipe the access log?
- No.
Screw it.
He's all the way on the other side of town.
I can't get there.
You gotta go.
- [Tires Squeal] - [Beeping]
[Cell Phone Rings]
- [Beeps]
- Hey, Sam.
Do you need some bowls?
Mike, you gotta get to Spencer's house.
Shannon set a bomb.
- It's under the house.
- It's gonna take me 25 minutes.
Well, Fi said 20.
I got my money on you, Mikey.
Get your ass in gear.
[Horn Honks]
- Oh, no!
[Muttering]
- Spencer!
No, you can't be here!
- Night is when they come!
- There's not time...
Fi, we've got a minute.
Come on.
You can't talk to him when he gets like that.
- If you're here...
- We missed her.
She's gonna erase everything.
- [Static] - [Man] Did you see the news?
Nobody was home.
I should have triggered the bomb in person.
[Shannon] Don't.
Do not second-guess me.
I took care of the thing at work.
We should be clear.
I'll call you.
- [Line Clicks]
- On the phone.
Messages from Procyon "A" don't usually...
No, they come on beams of light.
This must be a special occasion.
You know?
Desperate times.
- You tried to hack her files from your house, didn't you?
- Oh, yeah.
We were in such a rush before.
I thought if I took one more shot...
- Were they talking about killing me?
- We're gonna be all right.
Oh, no.
No.
No, no.
No, there's no way to catch her.
You heard her.
She wiped the evidence.
We're going to have to convince her to give us some new evidence.
Now that you're the only one she has reason to be afraid of... you're going to have to help.
Oh, no.
Oh, what are...
How?
Well, for starters, you're gonna have to be able to string two sentences together.
You're gonna have to talk to Shannon face to face.
You gotta be kidding me.
No, no, she's one of their leaders.
- Even the Guardians fear her.
- Spencer, this is really important.
You must stick to the script.
You cannot mention aliens, light beams or any of it.
Shannon can't find out we know what she is.
She can't find out that her cover's blown.
She'll call in for backup...
all the other beings.
Okay, that makes sense.
There is no leak.
I checked the SCI F access log.
There's nothing.
I think we need to consider the possibility that Brad...
There is a leak, but we got bigger problems.
Somebody else found out.
I got a call this morning from a Spencer Watkowski.
You've seen him.
He waters plants at the office.
He's ex-N.S.A. He's a real heavy hitter.
That's impossible.
The guy...
He's a nut.
He's way off.
Yeah, nice cover, don't you think?
He wants to meet.
But what I can't figure out is why he wants you there with me.
Breathe, Spencer.
[Michael] I said no surprises.
Why'd you bring a bodyguard?
[Spencer] Because she's the one who's selling names of American spies.
And she killed my friend Brad Wilkins, and she tried to kill me.
- You're the leak?
- It's not true.
It is true.
She's a murderer and a traitor.
Now, if you want this to be kept quiet, then I'm gonna need five million in cash.
- You don't have a shred of proof.
- Oh, yeah.
I know everything.
I know your whole dark plan.
And I know that you're one of them.
Ms. Park is one of those people who doesn't cover her tracks as well as they think.
Yesterday her password was "goldleaf1510. '"
Have you changed it yet, Shannon?
[Spencer] Oh, yeah.
You should see her computer.
She's got Zydeco-encrypted e-mails that look like this.
And when she decodes them, they look like that.
It's a fake.
He doesn't have the code.
He's bluffing.
Jesus, this is pathetic.
If you want to stay for this charade, you can.
I'm leaving.
I'm bluffing?
Then how do I know that you're setting up a deal... to sell another name to the Venezuelans?
Five million.
I'll bring the cash here at 10:00.
You bring a copy of everything you have.
Fine, but don't try and bring any backup.
- And don't bring any of your friends from Procyon.
- It'll just be me and the money.
Venezuela?
How did you...
Oh, the patterns.
Sometimes when you study them long enough...
Also, I saw a file labeled "Caracas" when I tried to hack her... but I couldn't get in, so...
[Michael] I can't believe you're this stupid.
- You put a hit out on him?
Who else knows?
- A thug.
He's nobody.
I found him in a biker bar.
He knows nothing.
You're gonna give me his name and address.
I'm cleaning this up.
Why did you agree to pay them?
Why not just kill them too?
You really think I'm gonna pay them?
No, we're going back to the office.
You're gonna give me a copy of Zydeco.
I'm gonna pin that on their bodies along with some embassy e-mails...
- I don't understand.
What do you think...
- Are you really this slow?
It has to look like Spencer stole the code... and the e-mails from an embassy.
If the problem is on the client side, then we're protected.
Stone Kittredge stock doesn't take a hit.
I can't get into the SCI F room on a weekend without people finding out.
Do you really think you're gonna keep your job?
Today's your last day, honey.
You gotta run... and you're never gonna stop, you understand?
- Is that Zydeco?
- Yeah.
- Where are the e-mails?
- My computer, but we have to print them out... from a printer outside the building so the feds can't trace them.
- Yeah, I may skip that part.
- What...
Hey!
What...
This isn't good-bye.
I'll say hi at your trial.
No!
Hey!
Hey!
- Let's see if this works.
- [Line Ringing]
[Ringing Continues]
[On Phone] This is Special Agent Johnson.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
This is, um...
Never mind.
I was just calling because there's a traitor...
- locked in the SCI F room at Stone Kittredge.
- What did you say?
Yeah, and there's a gig of state department e-mails on Shannon Park's computer... so you better get down here.
And you really should bring some backup.
That bitch is an alien.
[Handset Settles In Cradle]
Maybe he got abducted.
Hey!
Uh, sorry I'm late.
Thanks for meeting me.
I don't really trust the phone, so...
I wanted to be sure you saw the thing in the paper.
Shannon's copping a plea.
We saw it.
She's going to testify against the guy who killed Brad.
You ask me, something's wrong with the world when we don't hang traitors anymore.
- Doesn't seem right.
- Mmm.
You look good, Spencer.
Oh, really?
Well, I feel a little foggy, but...
The meds aren't great, but they come with the job, so... so it's worth it.
I hooked him up with a crypto gig.
Buddy of mine has a tech firm.
- How you likin' it, Spence?
- Oh, it's great.
It's great.
In fact, uh...
Oh, look.
I'm late.
- I should probably go.
- You know, I'll walk with you.
I have to make a stop myself.
And, you guys, thank you.
Thank you for, uh... for listening to me.
You probably shouldn't have listened to anything I said, but I'm glad you did.
[Michael] Spencer?
- You got him a job.
- I actually am kind of a sweetheart.
So there's one more thing I wanted to tell you about all the aliens.
- Uh, Spencer, I thought that you were...
- Oh...
Oh, no, no.
L-I know they're not real.
I just wanted to explain.
Well, in the beginning, the first messages...
This light in the window, this-this beautiful equation...
I should have just said something.
Yeah, I should have just told people.
But it was... it was all secret.
And in code.
And I didn't have anyone I could trust.
And you're lucky.
You're just lucky to have people like that.
Yeah.
Well, if there's ever anything I can do...
Yeah.
Hey.
I had some bowls like that once.
That is crazy.
I got this in an online auction.
Had to beat out some nasty Russians who were overbidding on everything.
I knew you liked Colombian art, so I thought... what better way to say I still want us to be friends?
Yes.
My bosses noticed your auction screen name.
"Michael Hearts Diego"?
You heard about that?
I'm embarrassed.
Nice choice you gave me.
Cop to the fact that I made contact with you, or admit to skimming... and accepting bribes from enemies of the state.
- Did you choose "A"?
- You're getting what you want.
I've been assigned to be your point of contact here in Miami.
You see?
Now you don't have to leave town.
No one has to lose.
It's a win-win.
Well, I get to win twice.
A new perk of my job is that I get to tell you this...
The Company is not interested in your services at this time.
Really?
- Maybe you should show 'em this.
- They know.
Did you really think that would get you back in?
The boys upstairs don't want to pin a medal on anyone for that mess.
They want to sweep it under the rug.
Get to know me, Diego.
I'm not one of the bad guys.
Michael.
They did say they'd review your file.
I wouldn't hold my breath, but who knows?
##[Latin]
##[Woman Singing In Spanish]
[Door Opens]
[Sighs, Groans]
[Groans] Hi.
Hi.
So, tell me...
How did it go?
To be honest, I'm not sure.
They're gonna need some more convincing.
Even then, I don't know.
Whatever happens... one of us will be happy, I guess.
Why can't you be with me on this?
Talking to you is like talking to Spencer.
You're both so focused on one thing, it clouds everything else.
It's a crazy way to live, Michael.
You know what?
I am like Spencer.
We both see the world a certain way, and we both have skills to make it a better place.
That's not a bad thing.
I don't want to keep ducking this, so let me be straight with you.
This job, what we just did...
saving American lives... this is the type of work I was made for, Fi.
It's what my old job gave me a chance to do every single day.
So, no, getting back in isn't just a way to survive or to protect the people I love.
It's what I want.
And if you truly care about me, you should damn well want for me what I want for myself.
If that's what you want...
I'll be with you.
I'll be with you.

michael:
my name is michael westen.
i used to be a spy until... [ cellphone rings ]
Man: we got a burn notice on you. you're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
Where am i?
miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi...
You know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too...
hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
nobody wants to hear from a burned spy.
your best bet is to find an active field operative who can't hang up on you.
if you're on domestic soil, the airport's not a bad place to look.
intelligence agencies are like amateur magicians.
watch closely, and you can see how they set up their tricks.
it doesn't matter how good they are at misdirection and sleight of hand, they can't make a covert-ops supply plane disappear.
4-u-m-y-3-1-4.
Oh, mike, you just wrecked the most amazing dream.
All these beautiful nachos were coming right -- 4-u-m-w-3-1-4, runway 3.
No flight plan, no problem?
Yep, and it's not a drug plane.
had clearance from the tower.
It's got to be a black flight.
[ sighs ]
Bringing toys to all the good little spooks in latin america.
Mike, please tell me this means
I can go back to sleep alone in my own bed.
Is that how you celebrate these days, sam?
Say it ain't so.
Fi. wow.
you look --
Like i'm ready for lunch at the delano?
I thought after a week
Of you eating fast food in the car with sam
That you might like to take me.
I can't today.
I found a spy plane.
i got the tail number.
Why do you use that shot for fake i.d.s?
It's like a bad prom picture.
I need to get some records from the f.a.a.
You need a driver's licen--
I think it makes me look trustworthy.
I need to find out who owns the plane, who flies it,
Who registered it.
One of those people might be able to pull some strings,
Get me back in.
And you have to find them immediately?
There's no time like the present.
It's time for "duane winger" to make his move.
Great.
i'm going to lunch.
Have fun getting your job back.
I know you don't like what i'm doing,
But you know it's not just about the job.
You know that, right?
right.
It's about patriotism and duty
And the sacred call of...
whatever.
I was told that hell on earth
Would rain down on me without an umbrella.
I don't know, duane.
Looks pretty sunny out there to me.
I'm gonna enjoy it.
[ door opens, closes ]
Prom picture?
Here we go, mr. winger.
The plane you're asking about is owned by executransport ltd.
Want to write it down?
you can borrow my pen.
[ southern accent ] how about you pull the whole file?
Could i borrow that?
oh, you're bad.
We can't sign files out.
Everything back here is look but don't touch.
That is a shame.
I'm gonna level with you. i'm a p.i. working a messy divorce.
Sleazebag hubby's hiding the jet under a shell company.
One little copy sure would help.
It'll be our little secret, miss...?
Linda.
man on p.a.: will duane winger please report to reception?
duane winger to reception, please.
The guy just wanted the files.
what's the big deal?
Man: the big deal is i just got a call from the deputy director.
That file was red-flagged.
michael: when you get cornered, there's a rush of adrenaline as the fight-or-flight response kicks in.
in those moments, you can't listen to your body.
there are some circumstances when flight just isn't the right option.
fortunately, with a little training and the right kind of hitch knot, all that adrenaline can make you capable of something pretty close to flight.
doesn't help the landing, though.
Barry wanted $1,000
Just to look into the company that owned that plane?
[ gunshots ] yeah. sorry, man.
He said to get the articles of incorporation,
He's got to go up to the capitol.
What, is he taking a cab to tallahassee?
Barry?
No. his mom is up there, so he's got to see her.
The grand is, like, an annoyance tax.
Fair enough.
[ chuckles ] money well spent, mikey.
You track down the spooks that are flying that plane,
Get them to call in a few favors,
You might not be stuck in miami that much longer,
And you won't have to buy me drinks after range practice.
Subtle, sam.
That's me, mike.
see the olive?
Not that i'm complaining, but where's fi?
It's not like her to skip our little ritual.
Usually any chance to pop off a few rounds...
yeah.
she wasn't too thrilled.
Hey, you!
hey, you in the sunglasses!
Can i see that gun?
aah!
Careful there.
oh, i'm sorry.
I promise i won't hurt you.
oh, that's good.
It's you.
i knew you existed.
who are you?
Uh, my name's spencer.
i-i didn't mean to scare you.
I had to make sure it was you.
He's the guy, right?
he's some kind of special-ops guy.
there are times in any spy's career when someone somehow figures out who you are.
I really need your help.
usually the best approach is to just put on a good poker face and deny everything.
I think you have the wrong idea.
no, no, no, no, no.
I-i've been -- i've been monitoring the papers,
Certain items in the blotter, and, uh, crime rates,
Police-band chatter, and i-it all adds up.
It becomes very clear.
not yet, it doesn't.
No. t-the pattern.
there's a pattern.
Uh, y-you don't just have,
Oh, oh, oh, hello, a series of controlled explosions here
And a dip in violent crime there.
You have to ask yourself, "what is the connection?
"who is the connection?"
So, i think to myself, "we're not talking about spider-man.
"w-we're talking about a real guy who has to practice."
So, i did a fermi estimate, and i got 63% odds
That he lives within a five-mile radius of this gun range, so...
Once you see a pattern, you can't unsee it.
So you've been staking out the shooting range,
Looking for...?
You a-and your gun a-and your skills
And -- and that thing that you did with the -- where you --
All that seems to confirm to me that you are the guy.
No, no. you have to help me.
you're the guy.
What can i say?
i'm not the guy.
That's a lie.
you lied.
V-very convincingly, as any trained operative would.
But, listen, you have to help me!
I don't want to make you, but i will if i have to.
Okay, he's -- he's an operative!
this guy!
he's very famous!
He's a rogue agent, special-operatives guy!
Okay. okay, fine.
We're gonna talk.
boy, are we gonna talk.
He's the spy.
so, who are you?
uh, no offense, spencer, but who are you?
Oh, i'm a mathematician, m.i.t.
Did my doctoral work at duke.
you were saying you need help?
About a year ago, i started to work at stone kittredge.
They do a lot of government contracts --
Construction, energy, tech.
Yeah, it's a defense firm.
we know them.
Well, i've seen some things there that i shouldn't have.
One of their vice presidents is a -- well, a killer.
Okay. is this just some kind of a joke?
she's killed three already.
It's gonna happen again soon, in malaysia, if i had to guess.
Malaysia?
I'm not sure what's going on here,
But do you have proof of something?
Not exactly, but how do you explain this --
I-i used my friend brad's workstation
To do some digging around in the system.
Two days later, the gas line at brad's house blew up,
And he was burned to death.
They thought he was onto them, so they killed my friend.
Calm down.
let's back it up, spencer.
Why were you using brad's computer?
I-i don't have a computer at the office.
Um...i take care of the plants at stone kittredge.
Ah, there it is.
I am too busy for a full-time job, okay?
Do you have any idea
How many messages i have to decode every day?
Hundreds!
do you think beings that advanced sleep?
I'm sorry.
"beings"?
Oh, oh, would you like me to say "aliens"?
The bad ones are from a nearby star system, procyon "a."
Uh, they -- they take our form.
They encode their messages in beams of light --
Gorgeous mathematics wrapped around deadly messages.
But the guardians,
They are from a planet that orbits around ross 154,
And they are being hunted.
Three of them are dead already.
Every minute that we waste -- okay. all right.
Just calm down a little bit.
no, damn it!
there is no time!
Spencer, calm down.
Calm down. calm down.
it's okay.
Yeah, excuse me, there's something i need right over here.
Sit down.
sorry.
He started talking about aliens, uh, crazy stuff.
He thought i was a spy.
[ chuckling ] you know, like james bond or something.
And you guys sure you don't want to file a report?
Oh, no, no, no, we just, uh,
Didn't want to see the guy hurt himself or anybody else.
Those are the magic words every time this guy goes to court.
Oh, so he's been in before?
oh, yeah.
Dispatch told us that mr. watkowski here
Has been in and out of the psych ward for the past four years.
Big-time schizo.
Sad stuff, but, guys, thanks.
appreciate your help, all right?
Take care.
Well, if you're looking for a silver lining,
It's nice to know that we can still call the cops, huh?
Can't believe he found me, sam.
[ laughs ] don't worry, mike.
Most people can't decode the secrets hidden in beams of light.
I don't know about you, but i could use that drink now.
a money launderer's natural habitat is near rich people.
what they save by avoiding taxes they usually spend on overpriced drinks, but meeting with them is never boring.
Jesus.
mike. hi.
"meet me at the chadwicke.
i'm poolside. bring cash."
This text doesn't even have a smiley face.
What happened to my friend barry?
Hey, you know i don't like charging you,
But that was a big favor.
I go up north, i got to stay with my mom.
She's still mad at me i dropped out of podiatry school.
Makes me nuts.
Anyway, i needed to unwind.
the view here helps.
A lot.
[ whistles ] barry.
Oh. okay.
executransport ltd.
You're probably not gonna be shocked to hear
That it's a shell company and its registrants don't even exist.
Officially speaking, nobody owns the plane you saw.
Not shocked, no.
But it wasn't a total dead end, though.
There's a real business tied to that plane?
North andes distribution.
They got a hangar over at the airport.
Probably packed the cargo on the very flight you saw.
Not bad, barry.
hey, listen.
Before you go, will you help me out here, mike?
Do my back?
Sam: hey, mike.
Look who's back.
hey, man. hey.
I'm so sorry to bother you at home, especially after...
I-i shouldn't have done that...
with the table.
Your new friend was just explaining
That he hacked the dmv and found your place
Thanks to a parking ticket, of all things.
He's really very clever.
so, they let you out?
well, they may as well have.
The nurses at that place don't even disguise the pattern of the rounds,
And the locks there are child's play.
Oh, there's no hard feelings.
i know you were just testing me.
Spencer...
you can't be here.
Oh, you're right. we shouldn't be out in the open like this.
They're probably looking for me.
the aliens?
The police.
i broke out of a psych ward.
Weren't you listening?
Spencer, we can't do anything for you.
I know people think my mind's not right, but i am right.
I'm right about this.
they killed my friend brad.
Please, just let me show you what i learned.
Hey, i found you, didn't i?
He doesn't seem that crazy to me.
All right.
show us.
Okay. i was wrong.
he's totally nuts.
Sorry about the --
Well, there's something
That i really need to show you in the paper.
I can't find anything in this mess.
Yeah. sometimes i lose track of things
When i leave them on the ceiling.
[ chuckles ] no. that's...
Oh, okay.
we can start there.
This is the one i was telling you about.
Three killed in the past four months, just like i said.
You said "aliens." this looks like american spies.
Well, the forms they take vary, but -- you're saying
These men were outed by an executive at stone kittredge?
Yes, that's what i'm saying.
wait a second.
ronald papa?
They said this was a climbing accident.
Mike, this guy was a friend of mine.
i mean, i worked with him.
Oh -- oh, good. so, you worked with one of the guardians.
No. don't do that.
I just sent flowers to ron's wife last month,
So don't be making up stories about real people.
Oh, i'm not. i lost a friend, too -- my friend brad,
T-the one t-they killed to cover it up.
The one i told you about.
See, uh, you have to -- you just have to read all these.
Please, just read them all.
Spencer, these are just a bunch of newspaper articles.
Oh, no. there's a pattern.
you have to see the pattern.
I-it's all connected.
There's a galactic war between these -- uh, the bad ones.
The ones from procyon "a" are hunting the guardians,
And guys like brad, who get in the middle,
They'll kill them, a-and then the darkness will come.
Unless you -- it's up to you to stop them.
Spencer...
i know this guy.
He's a good guy.
he's a good doctor.
I want you to meet him.
whether you're infiltrating a cartel or spiking a chemical-weapons sale, the most dangerous people in any covert op are the ones on your side.
if they crack, you end up in a shallow grave.
that's usually a good enough reason to avoid working with crazy people.
Mike.
michael.
Diplomat found dead in malaysia.
but sometimes you have no choice.
Oh, that's the one!
see, it's like i told you.
It's today's paper.
It happened just like he said it would.
Mike, if "aliens" equals "spies"...
What's wrong?
Spencer, i was really hoping you were just crazy.
Sam: okay. let me get this straight.
2007, stone kittredge gets the contract
To provide secure communications between american embassies.
So they do the usual firewall crap,
Plus they come up with a code.
Called zydeco, yes.
Okay, and you think somebody there
Is intercepting these encrypted e-mails
And selling the names of american spies.
That's your bogus theory.
What these procyon beings are really doing
Is exposing the guardians from ross 154.
Right, like my buddy ronnie.
But how do you know it's somebody inside of stone kittredge
And not some whack job on the outside
Who just cracked the code?
uh, that's absurd.
Absurd like "aliens are sending me messages
Through the pennysaver" absurd?
Zydeco's unbreakable.
it's a four-kilobyte code.
4k?
mike, i got pictures of miss reynolds on my phone
Bigger than that.
no, an algorithmic code
That takes up four kilobytes of space is beyond secure.
It would take longer than the whole life of the universe to crack it.
That -- that's impossible.
the-- the-- there's no way.
You'd really need the code to read those messages.
All right. fine.
relax.
Maybe there's another way that we can do this.
Will you sit down?
No, no, no!
there!
there she is!
that's her!
I-in the black!
that's shannon park!
Her team created zydeco!
think she kept a copy?
Yeah, yeah, and i know she has access to the embassy e-mail system.
That much i saw myself.
That's how my friend brad got killed.
She thought he was onto her.
Yeah, no, i'm telling you,
She -- she's a murderer and a traitor.
A-and you can see how she takes our form,
But i swear, she's an alien.
Let's stick to earth problems.
We need to look at shannon's files.
If she has an unauthorized copy of zydeco,
We can get her busted.
N-n-no.
you can't get into her system.
It's fort knox.
No. i-i-i tried to get in remotely, and i couldn't do it.
We hit her office, we bury a keystroke-tracking program,
Come back the next day for her password.
We get the e-mails and the code.
[ laughs ]
No, no. i'm sorry. i don't mean to laugh, but she's --
No, the-- these are very advanced beings.
No, she'd be able to tell if you were on her computer.
I-i think she's a little out of your league.
okay, mr. computer.
is she out of your league?
We need you to get us access at stone kittredge, spencer.
Jeremy dresner, consulting in i.t.
There should be a visitor badge in the system for me.
in medieval europe, spies used to pose as lepers and plague victims so they could snoop around without being bothered.
in today's corporate office, posing as i.t. works the same way.
it's the perfect cover if you need to linger without being bothered, and it gives you a pretext for talking to almost anyone.
Ms. park, jeremy dresner, i.t., alexandria office.
I need to speak with you.
Great.
make an appointment.
no problem.
how about now?
Excuse me?
We're doing an internal audit of security procedures.
I have the paperwork right here.
We were told your whole department would be cooperative,
Ms. park.
Well, that's funny, jeremy, 'cause i'm the head of this department,
And nobody's said word one to me.
Well, here i am, and we're way past word one now.
Security is our business on this wing.
Your business is installing software upgrades,
So i suggest you have somebody up on 14
Give me a call about this.
And i suggest they send somebody else next time.
oh, i bet they will.
i'll bet they'll send you up to see me, shannon.
I'm looking forward to it.
[ door slams ]
Can i borrow your bathroom key?
You're my hero.
all you need to beat a modern tumbler lock is a little information and some stone-age tools.
if you know the basic type of key you need to spoof, pick out a matching blank... file down the valleys to the center ledge... and you have a bump key.
apply torque, whack it with anything handy, and you're in.
Not quite as much fun as kicking a door down.
You ready to go?
To dinner?
it's 4:30.
I told you no more early-bird specials.
Yeah. i thought we would stop by the airport first,
Pay a visit to that front business barry found.
More spy hunting?
Michael, why must everything you do
Revolve around getting your old job back?
Fiona, really, this is important.
Oh, michael, come on.
I'll do it alone.
We're gonna have to do this eventually.
Yeah.
Just not right now.
drug cartels aren't the only organizations who use import/export businesses as fronts.
intelligence agencies like them because they make it possible for missions to finance themselves.
Who parked that gray truck out there?
Where's your boss?
they send out guns and supplies and get back goods to sell.
native antiquities are favorites because their subjective prices make money laundering easy.
Are you the manager?
No, mr. westen.
I'm diego garza.
i'm the spy you're looking for.
You're really not supposed to tell people you're a spy.
What's the point in subterfuge?
All the memos they sent from d.c.,
They say you're very, very good.
I have to assume you're here because you want back in.
Trying to reach out?
I like you, diego. you're doing all the work for me.
I don't want this to hurt your feelings,
But i'd really like you to get the hell out of here.
Not everything they told you about me is true.
Well, the part about me being really, really good.
But i just want to talk to your bosses so we can clear this up.
[ sighs, chuckles ] i wish it was that simple.
I have 20 years at the company.
i've seen villages burned.
I've seen children orphaned.
i've been shot twice.
And then they transferred me here.
Now, you know what the hardest part of this job is?
That forklift turns funny.
Now, if i report back that i made contact with a burned spy,
Do you know where they'll send me?
Me neither, but i'm not rocking this boat.
I'm giving you a chance to be a friend.
Mr. westen, i don't like threats.
But i love your sunglasses.
[ chuckles ]
You have a good one, okay?
doing a job in broad daylight means easier access but more witnesses.
you can walk right in with your unwanted audience, but you better have a plan to entertain them.
Well, all right.
Ladies and gentlemen, if i can borrow your attention,
I promise to return it in about an hour.
My name is charles finley.
you can call me charles.
[ laughs ] no.
I'm the dreaded teamwork consultant
That popped up on your calendar there.
So come on, everybody.
Follow me in to the conference room right now. let's go.
There's gonna be ice-cream cake.
it's my birthday.
Let's go. come on.
did i mention ice-cream cake?
Come on, folks. come on. break free from your cubicle, eh?
That's the ticket.
Oh, they warned me about you, ms. park.
I don't have time for this.
oh, now, come on, boss lady.
Let's be a good example for everybody, huh?
What do you say?
Hey, folks.
let's do this thing.
[ chuckles lightly ]
Have they all been taken?
Yeah, to the conference room.
Next chapter is entitled
"talk to me: enhancing your empowerment sphere."
Let's make this quick.
Has anyone here heard of the seventh sigma?
This is the newest commandment in the business bible, people.
Anyone?
Todd.
Though shalt not lie about ice-cream cake?
[ laughs ] oh, todd.
You're a joker, todd.
you're gonna stay after class.
See, that's all -- do you see that?
That encryption is zydeco.
those are all...
She shouldn't have those.
Those are all coded e-mails she's stealing.
Yeah. i was right.
Okay, spencer, i can't send a page of numbers to the fbi.
I need the code.
oh, i don't like this.
Does she have it or not?
no. i don't see it.
Look, though.
look at this.
She wiped all her bank records within 24 hours
Of accessing the system -- here, here again.
Every time she...
Spencer.
spencer, i need you to focus.
There's no point in her intercepting the e-mails
If she can't decrypt them.
No, no. listen, every time there's a payment --
Yesterday, today, twice.
oh, she sent two more names out.
Oh. i don't know where it's gonna happen next.
I don't know who's gonna die.
two more, but --
Spencer, it's gonna be fine if you find the code right now.
No. i told you. it's not here.
she's too careful.
She must borrow the copy that they keep in the scif room
And put it back when she's done.
Oh, god.
i should've seen it.
Wait. now you're telling me that her copy of the code
Is in a scif room?
!
That's a vault!
oh, no. i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
The pattern. i didn't see it.
i didn't see any of this.
get out of the chair!
...which brings us to the finley method.
Oh. excuse me. i'm sorry.
are you leaving us?
I have work to do.
Folks, be right back.
turn to page seven.
Hey, hey!
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey!
shannon!
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm sending myself a copy of everything encrypted.
Let's go.
Let's hit the reset button.
do it together.
Hit the button.
let's reset the clock.
No. wait. we have to -- we have to take her machines.
No. we have to take her machines.
We have to find the names.
she could have buried it.
spencer!
No. we -- we have to warn the guardians. no!
we have to!
The darkness will come.
The darkness will come, and you'll see!
You'll look up, the stars will go out,
And every night, every night -- [ loudly ] we can be positive, shannon. this is all about...
That's enough.
[ in distance ] you're killing me here. oh, come on.
Enough.
Come on, spencer.
come on.
They're all gonna die.
We don't have the code.
they're all gonna die.
Spencer: i could --
I-i'll try to hack into shannon's computer again remotely.
If i leave a line open,
Maybe i can catch her when she uses the code.
You can't -- if you get caught,
She can trace where you live and -- she sent more names!
We don't know who or where, but we know they're gonna die,
And those files you stole from her computer
Are useless without a copy of zydeco.
Well, that's not true.
we can use -- there's no point in trying.
No. there's no use in even -- even --
Even attempting to break that code.
You understand?
the whole life of the universe.
Listen, please!
no. i know you're trying to help,
But if you think you can break in to the scif room to steal that code,
No, i'm sorry, that's never gonna happen.
You see, there's a nine-digit keypad.
I'm not going -- and shannon and her friends from procyon "a"
Won't just sit back and watch.
[ sighs ]
Spencer, michael isn't going to decrypt
The e-mails that shannon stole.
He's going to use them as a prop to scare her.
No.
i don't see that.
[ sighs ]
We're gonna convince her that someone's hunting for the leak.
She'll stop selling names, cover her tracks.
We'll tip the fbi
When she goes to erase the scif room's access code.
She'll be arrested, and no more spies die.
There's justice for your friend.
The alien goes to jail.
Oh, well, that sounds good.
is that what you were gonna say?
If you want to keep your job,
Keep walking, keep your voice down, and act casual.
We don't have a jeremy dresner in virginia. i checked.
Who are you, and -- the people we both work for
Don't know my name, and neither will you.
I'm the guy cleaning up your mess. that's all you get.
What mess?
two days ago, you were an i.t. guy.
Two days ago, i was shaking the tree.
There's a leak coming from tech.
that's your department.
We're staring down the barrel of a federal case
And a massive p.r. disaster -- zydeco's compromised.
Three american operatives are already dead.
This is ridiculous.
I don't know who you are.
i'm calling my boss.
Go ahead. use mine if you'd rather deal
With a massive federal investigation.
Shannon, the feds are just sniffing at this now.
We got two days.
After that, your stock options
Won't be worth the paper they're printed on.
This doesn't make any sense.
that embassy system is airtight.
zydeco was my project.
Believe me, honey, i know it was.
Where did you get that?
I need you to call upstairs,
Cancel all your appointments for the day.
There's something i need you to see.
Two weeks ago, i get a call from one of our employers.
One of your programmers in your department
Got himself blown up --
Brad wilkins.
They asked me to have a look.
Cops said that was an accident.
Yeah. miami dade detectives make 56 grand a year.
How much do you think i make?
They didn't even know about this boat.
Your boy brad had it registered under his mother's name.
He was careful, just not careful enough.
where'd he get those?
That's what we're trying to find out. try to keep up, honey.
Notes in the margins -- now, i learned about the leak
Because brad found out about the leak.
He was hunting them.
Why he didn't share this news, i don't know,
But he sure did get himself killed.
what do the notes say?
He wanted to look at the scif access logs.
Now i do.
that's eyes only.
I'm not gonna show you that.
you absolutely will.
Tomorrow is saturday. there will be nobody in the office.
You'll meet me here at 10:00 so i know you're clean.
Then we go have a show-and-tell.
cellphones are basically wireless computers.
What is this?
upload the right program, and you've got a roving bug you can turn on remotely.
You will keep that on you.
If you need to talk to me before tomorrow morning,
You will use that, not the office, not the home phone.
Last person who looked into this leak was killed.
You never know who's listening.
What if we're -- tomorrow morning.
No excuses.
you be here.
[ static, fridge door closes ]
"we don't know who's listening."
Guess we're up and running.
10 by 10.
Hey, how'd virgil's boat work out?
Did i ever tell you about the marlin we caught
Off of pigeon key?
yeah, a few times.
Hey, do you mind keeping an ear on shannon tonight?
I got to head down to the airport,
See if i can't motivate our pal diego.
front companies generally make easy targets for burglary.
they don't want people wondering what they have to hide, so they tend not to install a lot of lights, alarms, and security cameras.
and, of course, they'd never invite the police in to investigate, so there's really no need to be shy about leaving clues.
But you got to admit, it's elegant.
We catch shannon wiping the access log tonight,
And she goes to jail.
It's not the crime.
it's the cover-up.
Fiona: i understand the plan.
i just don't like it.
I wish we could forget about this catch-her-in-the act,
Call-the-feds nonsense and drive to her house right now
And finish this properly.
I should be home in bed right now.
Hey, hey.
don't be dozing off out there.
Freaking amateur hour around here.
[ cellphone rings ] yeah. hold on.
Shannon: yeah. it's shannon.
you find it?
10437 crest, right?
you sure you want to do this?
I told you, there's heat on me at work.
An i.p. address at that location tried to hack me,
Some nut from the office.
I am not taking chances.
we got to tie this up cleanly.
You cannot be around --
I'll put a timer underneath the house, same as brad.
It goes off at midnight.
i'll be long gone by then.
Good, and get off the phone.
Fi, did you hear that?
Spencer stuck his neck out, and she caught him.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to spencer's.
I'm gonna have to leave the front door open here.
What if she comes to wipe the access log?
No. screw it.
He's all the way on the other side of town.
I can't get there.
you got to go.
[ tires screech ] [ dialing ]
[ cellphone rings ]
Hey, sam.
do you need some bowls?
Mike, you got to get to spencer's house.
Shannon set a bomb.
it's under the house.
It's gonna take me 25 minutes.
well, fi said 20.
I got my money on you, mikey.
get your ass in gear.
[ tires screech ]
Spencer!
no, no, no!
you can't be here!
I'm not one of them!
night is when they come!
Michael: fi, we've got a minute.
come on.
You can't talk to him when he gets like that.
If you're here...
We missed her.
she's gonna erase everything.
Man: did you see the news?
nobody was home.
I should have triggered the bomb in person.
Shannon: don't.
do not second-guess me.
I took care of the thing at work.
We should be clear.
i'll call you.
On the phone?
messages from procyon "a" don't usually --
No. they come on beams of light.
This must be a special occasion.
you know, desperate times?
You tried to hack her files from your house, didn't you?
Yeah. we were in such a rush before.
I thought if i took one more shot...
W-were they talking about killing me?
You're gonna be all right.
oh, no, no, no, no.
No, there's no way to catch her.
you heard her.
She wiped the evidence.
We're going to have to convince her to give us some new evidence.
Now that you're the only one she has reason to be afraid of,
You're going to have to help.
Oh, no. oh, what are you -- how?
Well, for starters, you're gonna have to be able to string two sentences together.
You're gonna have to talk to shannon face-to-face.
You got to be kidding me.
No, no.
she's one of their leaders.
Even the guardians fear her.
Spencer, this is really important.
You must stick to the script.
You cannot mention aliens, light beams, or any of it.
Shannon can't find out we know what she is.
She can't find out that her cover's blown.
She'll call in for backup...
All the other beings.
Okay. that makes sense.
There is no leak.
I checked the scif access log.
there's nothing.
I think we need to consider the possibility that brad --
There is a leak, but we got bigger problems.
Somebody else found out.
I got a call this morning from a spencer watkowski.
You've seen him.
he waters plants at the office.
He's ex-nsa.
he's a real heavy hitter.
That's impossible.
The guy -- he's a nut.
he's way off.
Yeah. nice cover, don't you think?
He wants to meet, but what i can't figure out
Is why he wants you there with me.
Breathe, spencer.
Michael: i said no surprises.
why'd you bring a bodyguard?
Because she's the one who's selling names of american spies
And she killed my friend brad wilkins and she tried to kill me.
You're the leak?
that's not true.
it is true.
She's a murderer and a traitor.
If you want this to be kept quiet,
Then i'm gonna need $5 million in cash.
You don't have a shred of proof.
oh, yeah.
i know everything.
I know your whole dark plan, and i know that you're one of them.
Ms. park is one of those people
Who doesn't cover her tracks as well as they think.
Yesterday, her password was "gold leaf 1510."
Have you changed it yet, shannon?
O-oh, yeah.
you should see her computer.
She's got zydeco-encrypted e-mails that look like this,
A-and when she decodes them, they look like that.
That's a fake.
He doesn't have the code.
he's bluffing.
Jesus.
this is pathetic.
If you want to stay for this charade, you can.
I'm leaving.
I'm bluffing?
then how do i know that you're setting up a deal
To sell another name to the venezuelans?
!
$5 million?
I'll bring the cash here at 10:00.
You'll bring a copy of everything you have.
Fine, but don't try and bring any backup, and you don't try and bring
Any of your friends from procy-- it'll just be me and the money.
Venezuela?
how did you --
Oh, the patterns, sometimes, when you study them long enough.
Also, i saw a file labeled "caracas"
When i tried to hack her, but i couldn't get in, so...
Michael: i can't believe you're this stupid.
You put a hit out on him?
who else knows?
a thug. he's nobody.
I found him in a biker bar.
he knows nothing.
You're gonna give me his name and his address.
i'm cleaning this up.
Why did you agree to pay them?
why not just kill them, too?
You really think i'm gonna pay them?
!
No. we're going back to the office.
You're gonna give me a copy of zydeco.
I'm gonna pin that on their bodies along with some embassy e-mails.
I don't understand!
what do you think is gonna --
Are you really this slow?
It has to look like spencer stole the code
And the e-mails from an embassy.
If the problem is on the client's side,
Then we're protected.
Stone kittredge stock doesn't take a hit.
I can't get into the scif room on a weekend without people finding out.
Do you really think you're gonna keep your job?
Today's your last day, honey.
You're gonna run, and you're never gonna stop.
You understand?
Is that zydeco?
yeah.
Where are the e-mails?
My computer, but we have to print them out
From a printer outside the building
So the feds can't trace them.
Yeah. i may skip that part.
Hey!
what --
This isn't goodbye.
I'll say hi at your trial.
No!
Hey!
Hey!
Let's see if this works.
[ beeping ]
This is special agent johnson.
Hello. hi. hello.
This is, um...
never mind.
I was just calling because there's a traitor
Locked in the scif room at stone kittredge.
What did you say?
Yeah, and there's a gig of state department e-mails
On shannon park's computer, so you'd better get down here,
And you really should bring some backup.
That bitch is an alien.
[ thud ]
Maybe he got abducted.
Hey!
sorry i'm late.
thanks for meeting me.
I-i don't really trust the phones, so...
I wanted to be sure you saw the thing in the paper.
Shannon's copping a plea.
michael:
we saw it.
She's going to testify against the guy who killed brad.
You ask me, something's wrong with the world
When we don't hang traitors anymore -- doesn't seem right.
You look good, spencer.
Oh, really?
well, i feel a little foggy.
But t-the meds aren't great, but they come with the job,
So -- so it's worth it.
sam: i hooked him up with a crypto gig.
Buddy of mine has a tech firm.
how you liking it, spence?
Oh, it's great.
it's great.
In fact, oh, l-look. i'm late.
i should probably go.
You know, i'll walk with you.
i have to make a stop myself.
And, you guys, thank you -- thank you for -- for listening to me.
You probably shouldn't have listened to anything i said, but i'm glad you did.
Spencer?
You got him a job.
I actually am kind of a sweetheart.
So, there's one more thing i wanted to tell you about all the aliens.
Uh, spencer, i thought that you were -- oh, oh, no, no.
I-i know they're not real.
i just wanted to explain.
Well, i-in the beginning, the first messages,
This light in the window,
This -- this beautiful equation --
I should have just said something.
I-i should have just told people.
But it was -- it was all secret and in code,
And -- and i didn't have anyone i could trust.
A-and you're lucky. you're just lucky to have people like that.
Yeah.
Well, if there's ever anything i can do...
Yeah.
Hey.
I had some bowls like that once.
That is crazy.
i got this in an online auction.
Had to beat out some nasty russians
Who were overbidding on everything.
I knew you liked colombian art, so i thought,
"what better way to say i still want us to be friends"?
Yes. my boss has noticed your auction screen name.
Michaelheartsdiego.
You heard about that.
i'm embarrassed.
Nice choice you gave me.
Cop to the fact that i made contact with you,
Or admit to skimming and accepting bribes from enemies of the state.
Did you choose "a"?
you're getting what you want.
I've been assigned to be your point of contact here in miami.
You see?
now you don't have to leave town.
No one has to lose.
it's a win-win.
Well, i get to win twice.
The new perk of my job is that i get to tell you this --
The company is not interested in your services at this time.
Really?
Maybe you should show them this.
they know.
Did you really think that would get you back in?
The boys upstairs don't want to pin a medal on anyone
For that mess.
They want to sweep it under the rug.
Get to know me, diego.
I'm not one of the bad guys.
Michael they did say they'd review your file.
I wouldn't hold my breath, but who knows?
[ sighs ]
Ugh.
Hi.
Hi.
So, tell me, how did it go?
To be honest, i'm not sure.
They're gonna need some more convincing.
Even then, i don't know.
Whatever happens...
One of us will be happy, i guess.
Why can't you be with me on this?
Talking to you...
is like talking to spencer.
You're both so focused on one thing.
It clouds everything else.
It's a crazy way to live, michael.
you know what?
i am like spencer.
We both see the world a certain way,
And we both have skills to make it a better place.
That's not a bad thing.
I don't want to keep ducking this,
So let me be straight with you.
This job, what we just did, saving american lives,
This is the type of work i was made for, fi.
It's what my old job gave me a chance to do every single day.
So, no, getting back in isn't just a way to survive,
To protect the people i love.
it's what i want.
And if you truly care about me,
You should damn well want for me what i want for myself.
If that's what you want i'll be with you.
I'll be with you.
[ breathing shakily ]
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until-
- We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
When you're burned, you've got nothing- no cash, no credit, nojob history.
- You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend-
- Should we shoot them?
An old friend who used to inform on you to the F.B.I. -
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.
- Family too-
- Hey, is that your mom again?
- if you're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.
Bottom line:
As long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
Nobody wants to hear from a burned spy.
Your old handlers send your calls straight to voice mail.
Your appeals are filed in the trash.
Your old contacts are worthless.
Your best bet is to find an active field operative who can't hang up on you.
If you're on domestic soil, the airport's not a bad place to look.
Intelligence agencies are like amateur magicians.
Watch closely, and you can see how they set up their tricks.
It doesn't matter how good they are at misdirection and sleight ofhand.
They can't make a covert ops supply plane disappear.
Four-U-M-Y-three-one-four.
Oh, Mikey.
You just wrecked the most amazing dream.
All these beautiful nachos were coming right- 4
- U-M-Y-3-1-4.
Runway 3.
No flight plan, no problem?
Yep, and it's not a drug plane.
Had clearance from the tower.
It's got to be a black flight.
Bringing toys to all the good little spooks in Latin America.
Mike, please tell me this means I can go back to sleep alone in my own bed.
Is that how you celebrate these days, Sam?
Say it ain't so.
Fi.
Wow, you look-
Like I'm ready for lunch at the Delano.
I thought after a week of you eating fast food in the car with Sam... that you might like to take me.
I can't today.
I found a spy plane.
I got the tail number.
Why do you use that shot for fake I.D.'s?
It's like a bad prom picture.
I need to get some records from the F.A.A.
You need a driver's lic-
I think it makes me look trustworthy.
But I need to find out who owns the plane, who flies it, who registered it.
One of those people might be able to pull some strings, get me back in.
- And you have to find them immediately?
- Well, there's-
There's no time like the present.
It's time for Duane Winger to make his move.
Great.
I'm going to lunch.
Have fun getting your job back.
I know you don't like what I'm doing.
But you know it's not just about the job.
- You know that, right?
- Right.
It's about patriotism and duty.
And the sacred call of... whatever.
I was told that hell on earth would rain down on me without an umbrella.
I don't know, Duane.
Looks pretty sunny out there to me.
I'm gonna enjoy it.
Prom picture?
Here we go, Mr. Winger.
The plane you're asking about is owned by Executransport, Ltd.
Want to write it down?
You can borrow my pen.
How about you pull the whole file?
- Could I borrow that?
- Oh, you're bad.
We can't sign files out.
Everything back here is "look but don't touch. "
That is a shame.
I'm gonna level with you.
I'm a P.I. Workin' a messy divorce.
Sleazebag hubby's hidin' a jet under a shell company.
One little copy sure would help.
Inspector Foster to Hangar 5.
It'd be our little secret, Miss-
Linda.
Will Duane Winger please report to Reception?
Duane Winger to Reception, please.
The guy just wanted a file.
What's the big deal?
The big deal is I just got a call from the deputy director.
That file was red flagged.
When you get cornered, there's a rush of adrenaline... as the fight-or-flight response kicks in.
In those moments, you can't listen to your body.
There are some circumstances when flightjust isn't the right option.
Fortunately, with a little training and the right kind ofhitch knot... all that adrenaline can make you capable of something pretty close to flight.
Doesn't help the landing though.
Barry wanted a thousand dollars just to look into the company that owned that plane?
Yeah.
Sorry, man.
He said to get the articles of incorporation... he's got to go up to the capital.
What, is he taking a cab to Tallahassee?
Barry?
No.
His mom is up there, so he's gotta see her.
The grand is like an annoyance tax.
Fair enough.
It'll be money well spent, Mikey.
You track down the spooks that are flying that plane... get 'em to call in a few favors, you might not be stuck in Miami that much longer.
And you won't have to buy me drinks after range practice.
Subtle, Sam.
That's me, Mike.
See the olive?
Not that I'm complaining, but where's Fi?
It's not like her to skip our little ritual...
- use any chance to pop off a few rounds.
- She wasn't too thrilled-
Hey, you!
Hey, you!
You in the sunglasses!
Hey, can I see that gun?
- Careful there.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I promise I won't hurt you.
- Oh, that's good.
- It's you.
I knew you existed.
- Who are you?
My name is Spencer.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I had to make sure it was you.
He's the guy, right?
He's some kind of special ops guy.
There are times in any spy's career when someone...
- somehow figures out who you are.
- I really need your help.
Usually the best approach is tojust put on a good poker face and deny everything.
- I think you have the wrong idea.
- No.
No, no, no, no.
L
- I've been
- I've been monitoring the paper- certain items in the blotter- and crime rates, police band chatter.
- And it all adds up.
It becomes very clear.
- Not yet it doesn't.
No, the pattern-There's a pattern.
Y
- You don't just have, oh, oh, hello... a series of controlled explosions here and a dip in violent crime there.
You have to ask yourself, " What is the connection?
Who is the connection?"
So I think to myself, "We're not talking about Spider-Man. "
We're talking about a real guy who has to practice.
So I did a Fermi estimate, and I got 63% odds that he lives... within a five-mile radius of this gun range, so-
Once you see a pattern, you can't unsee it.
So you've been staking out the shooting range looking for-
You.
And your gun.
And your skills.
And-And that thing that you did with the- where you-
All that seems to confirm to me that you are the guy.
No, no.
You have to help me.
You're the guy.
What can I say?
I'm not the guy.
That's a lie.
You lied.
Very convincingly, as any trained operative would.
Listen.
You have to help me.
I don't want to make you, but I will if I have to.
Okay.
He's an operative!
This guy!
Very famous.
He's a rogue agent- special operatives guy.
Okay, okay, fine.
We're gonna talk.
Boy, are we gonna talk.
He's the spy.
So who are you?
Uh, no offense, Spencer, but who are you?
Oh, I'm a mathematician.
M.I.T.
- Did my doctoral work at Duke.
- You were saying you need help?
About a year ago I started to work at Stone Kittredge.
They do a lot of government contracts- construction, energy, tech.
Yeah, it's a defense firm.
We know 'em.
Well, I've seen some things there that I shouldn't have.
One of their vice presidents is a-well, a killer.
Okay, is this just some kind of a joke?
She's killed three already.
It's gonna happen again soon.
In Malaysia, if I had to guess.
Malaysia?
I'm not sure what's going on here, but do you have proof of something?
Not exactly, but how do you explain this?
I used my friend Brad's workstation to do some digging around in the system.
Two days later, the gas line at Brad's house blew up, and he was burned to death.
They thought he was onto them, so they killed my friend.
Calm down.
Let's back it up, Spencer.
Why were you using Brad's computer?
L
- I don't have a computer at the office.
I'm-
I take care of the plants at Stone Kittredge.
- Ah.
There it is.
- I am too busy for a full-time job, okay?
Do you have any idea how many messages I have to decode every day?
Hundreds.
Do you think beings that advanced sleep?
I'm sorry. "Beings"?
Oh, oh.
Would you like me to say "aliens"?
The bad ones are from a nearby star system
- Procyon "A."
They-They take our form.
They encode their messages in beams of light.
Gorgeous mathematics wrapped around deadly messages.
But the Guardians- they are from a planet that orbits around Ross 154.
And-And they are being hunted.
Three of them are dead already.
- Every minute that we waste-
- Okay.
All right.
Just calm down a little bit here.
No, damn it!
There is no time!
Spencer, calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Uh, there's something I need right over here.
Sit down.
Sorry.
He started talking about aliens-
Uh, crazy stuff.
He thought I was a spy.
You know, likeJames Bond or something.
- And you guys sure you don't wanna file a report?
- Oh, no, no, no.
We just didn't want to see the guy hurt himself or anybody else.
Those are the magic words every time this guy goes to court.
- Oh, so he's been in before?
- Oh, yeah.
Dispatch told us that Mr. Watkowski here... has been in and out of the psych ward for the past four years.
Big-time schizo.
Sad stuff, but, guys, thanks.
Appreciate your help, all right?
- Take care.
- Well, if you're looking for a silver lining... it's nice to know that we can still call the cops, huh?
Can't believe he found me, Sam.
Don't worry, Mike.
Most people can't decode the secrets... hidden in beams of light.
I don't know about you, but I could use that drink now.
A money launderer's natural habitat... is near rich people.
What they save by avoiding taxes... they usually spend on overpriced drinks.
But meeting with them is never boring.
Jesus.
Mike.
Hi.
"Meet me at the Chadwick.
I'm poolside.
Bring cash. "
This text doesn't even have a smiley face.
What happened to my friend Barry?
Hey, you know I don't like charging you, but that was a big favor.
I go up north, I gotta stay with my mom.
She's still mad at me I dropped out of podiatry school.
Makes me nuts.
Anyway, I needed to unwind.
The view here helps... a lot.
- Barry.
- Oh.
Okay.
Executransport, Ltd.
You're probably not gonna be shocked to hear that it's a shell company... and its registrants don't even exist.
Officially speaking, nobody owns the plane you saw.
- Not shocked, no.
- But it wasn't a total dead end though.
There's a real business tied to that plane?
North Andes Distribution.
They got a hangar over at the airport.
Probably packed the cargo on the very flight you saw.
Not bad, Barry.
Hey, listen, before you go, uh, you help me out here, Mike?
Do my back?
Hey, Mike.
Look who's back.
Hey, man.
Hey.
I'm so sorry to bother you at home, especially after-
I shouldn't have done that.
The table.
Your new friend was just explaining that he hacked the D.M. V... and found your place thanks to a parking ticket, of all things.
- He's really very clever.
- So... they let you out?
Well, they may as well have.
The nurses at that place... don't even disguise the pattern of the rounds, and the locks there are child's play.
Oh, there's no hard feelings.
I know you werejust testing me.
Spencer, you can't be here.
You're right.
We shouldn't be out in the open like this.
They're probably looking for me.
- The aliens?
- The police.
I broke out of a psych ward.
Weren't you listening?
Spencer, we can't do anything for you.
I know people think my mind's not right, but I am right.
I'm right about this.
They killed my friend Brad.
Please, just let me show you what I learned.
Hey, I found you, didn't I?
He doesn't seem that crazy to me.
All right, show us.
Okay.
I was wrong.
He's totally nuts.
Sorry about the
- Oh, there's something I really need to show you in the paper.
I can't find anything in this mess.
Yeah, sometimes I lose track of things when I leave them on the ceiling.
Ha!
No, that's-
Oh, okay, we can start there.
This is the one I was telling you about.
Three killed in the past four months.
- Just like I said.
- You said aliens.
- This looks like American spies.
- Well, the forms they take vary, but-
You're saying these men were outed by an executive at Stone Kittredge?
- Yes, that's what I'm saying.
- Wait a second.
Ronald Papa?
They said this was a climbing accident.
Mike, this guy was a friend of mine.
I mean, I worked with him.
Oh, oh, good.
So you worked with one of the Guardians.
No, don't do that.
I just sent flowers to Ron's wife... last month, so don't be making up stories about real people.
Oh, I'm not.
I lost a friend too.
My friend Brad.
The one they killed to cover it up.
The one I told you about.
See, you have to-You just have to read all these.
Please, just read them all.
Spencer, these are just a bunch of newspaper articles.
Oh, no, there's a pattern.
You have to see the pattern.
It's all connected.
There's a galactic war between these- the bad ones-
The ones from Procyon "A" are hunting the Guardians.
And guys like Brad who get in the middle- they'll kill them.
And then the darkness will come.
Unless you
- It's up to you to stop them.
Spencer, I know this guy.
He's a good guy.
He's a good doctor.
I want you to meet him.
Whether you're infiltrating a cartel... or spiking a chemical weapons sale, the most dangerous people in any covert op... are the ones on your side.
If they crack, you end up in a shallow grave.
That's usually a good enough reason to avoid working with crazy people.
Mike.
Michael.
"Diplomat Found Dead in Malaysia. "
But sometimes you have no choice.
Oh, that's the one, see?
It's like I told you.
It's today's paper.
It happened just like he said it would.
Mike, if aliens equal spies-
- What's wrong?
- Spencer, I was really hoping you were just crazy.
#Yeah ##
Okay, let me get this straight.
2007, Stone Kittredge gets the contract... to provide secure communications between American embassies.
So they do the usual firewall crap, plus they come up with a code.
- Called Zydeco, yes.
- Okay, and you think somebody there... is intercepting these encrypted e-mails... and selling the names of American spies- that's your bogus theory?
What these Procyon beings are really doing is exposing the Guardians from Ross 154.
Right.
Like my buddy Ronnie.
But how do you know it's somebody inside of Stone Kittredge... and not some whack-job on the outside who just cracked the code?
- Uh, that's absurd.
- Absurd... like " aliens are sending me messages through the PennySaver" absurd?
Zydeco's unbreakable.
It's a four-kilobyte code.
4K?
Mike, I got pictures of Miss Reynolds on my phone bigger than that.
No, an algorithmic code that takes up four kilobytes of space is beyond secure.
It would take longer than the whole life of the universe to crack it.
That-That's impossible.
Th-There's no way.
You'd really-
- You'd really need the code to read those messages.
- All right, fine.
Relax.
Maybe there's another way that we can do this.
- Will you sit down?
- No, no.
There she is.
That's her.
In the black.
That's Shannon Park.
Her team created Zydeco.
Think she kept a copy?
Yeah, and I know she has access to the embassy e-mail system.
That much I saw myself.
That's how my friend Brad got killed.
She thought he was onto her.
No, I'm telling you
- She's a murderer and a traitor.
And you can see how she takes our form.
But I swear, she's an alien.
Let's stick to Earth problems.
We need to look at Shannon's files.
If she has an unauthorized copy of Zydeco, we can get her busted.
No, y-you can't get into her system.
It's Fort Knox.
No, I-I-I tried to get in remotely and I couldn't do it.
We hit her office.
We bury a keystroke tracking program.
Come back the next day for her password.
We get the e-mails and the code.
No, no.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh, but she's-
No, look, these are very advanced beings.
She'd be able to tell if you were on her computer.
L
- I think she's a little out of your league.
Okay, Mr. Computer.
Is she out of your league?
We need you to get us access at Stone Kittredge, Spencer.
Jeremy Dresner, consulting in I.T.
There should be a visitor badge in the system for me.
In medieval Europe... spies used to pose as lepers and plague victims... so they could snoop around without being bothered.
In today's corporate office, posing as I. T. Works the same way.
It's the perfect cover if you need to linger without being bothered.
And it gives you a pretext for talking to almost anyone.
Miss Park.
Jeremy Dresner, I.T., Alexandria office.
I need to speak with you.
- Great.
Make an appointment.
- No problem.
How about now?
Excuse me?
We're doing an internal audit of security procedures.
I have the paperwork right here.
We were told your whole department... would be cooperative, Ms. Park.
Well, that's funny, Jeremy.
'Cause I'm the head of this department... and nobody's said word one to me.
Well, here I am, and we're way past word one now.
Security is our business on this wing.
Your business is installing software upgrades.
So I suggest you have somebody up on 14 give me a call about this...
- and I suggest they send somebody else next time.
- Oh, I bet they will.
I bet they'll send you up to see me, Shannon.
I'm looking forward to it.
Can I borrow your bathroom key?
You're my hero.
All you need to beat a modern tumbler lock... is a little information and some Stone Age tools.
If you know the basic type ofkey you need to spoof, pick out a matching blank... file down the valleys to the center ledge... and you have a bump key.
Apply torque, whack it with anything handy, and you're in.
Not quite as much fun as kicking a door down.
You ready to go?
To dinner?
It's 4:30.
I told you, no more early-bird specials.
Yeah, I thought we would stop by the airport first...
- pay a visit to that front business Barry found.
- More spy hunting?
Michael, why must everything you do revolve around getting your old job back?
- Fiona, really.
This is important.
- Oh, Michael, come on.
I'll do it alone.
We're gonna have to do this eventually.
Yeah.
Just not right now.
Drug cartels aren't the only organizations... who use import-export businesses as fronts.
Intelligence agencies like them because... they make it possible for missions to finance themselves.
Who parked that gray truck out there?
Where's your boss?
They send out guns and supplies and get back goods to sell.
Native antiquities are favorites... because their subjective prices make money laundering easy.
You the manager?
No, Mr. Westen.
I'm Diego Garza.
I'm the spy you're looking for.
You're really not supposed to tell people you're a spy.
What's the point in subterfuge?
All the memos they send from D.C., they say you're very, very good.
I have to assume you're here because you want back in.
Trying to reach out?
I like you, Diego.
You're doing all the work for me.
I don't want this to hurt your feelings... but I'd really like you to get the hell out of here.
Not everything they told you about me is true.
Well, the part about me being really, really good, but-
I just want to talk to your bosses so we can clear this up.
I wish it was that simple.
I have 20 years at the Company.
I've seen villages burned.
I've seen children orphaned.
I've been shot twice.
Then they transferred me here.
Now, you know what the hardest part of this job is?
That forklift turns funny.
Now, if I report back that I made contact with a burned spy... do you know where they'll send me?
Me neither.
And I'm not rocking this boat.
I'm giving you a chance to be a friend.
Mr. Westen, I don't like threats.
But I love your sunglasses.
You have a good one, okay?
Doing a job in broad daylight... means easier access but more witnesses.
You can walk right in with your unwanted audience... but you better have a plan to entertain them.
Well, all right, ladies and gentlemen.
If I can borrow your attention, I promise to return it in about an hour.
My name is Charles Finley.
You can call me Charles.
I know.
I'm the dreaded teamwork consultant that popped up on your calendar there.
So, come on, everybody.
Follow me into the conference room right now.
Let's go.
- There's gonna be ice cream cake.
It's my birthday.
Let's go.
Come on.
Did I mention ice cream cake?
Come on, folks.
Come on.
Break free from your cubicle, huh?
That's the ticket.
Whoa, ho!
They warned me about you, Ms. Park.
- I don't have time for this.
- Oh, now, come on, boss lady.
Let's be a good example for everybody, huh?
What do you say?
Hey, folks.
Let's do this thing.
Have they all been taken?
Yeah, to the conference room.
Next chapter is entitled " Talk to Me:
Enhancing Your Empowerment Sphere. "
Let's make this quick.
Has anyone here heard of the Seventh Sigma?
This is the newest commandment in the business bible, people.
Anyone?
- Todd.
- "Thou shalt not lie about ice cream cake"?
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, Todd.
You're a joker, Todd.
You're gonna stay after class.
See, that's all
- Do you see that?
That encryption is Zydeco.
Those are all-She shouldn't have those.
Those are all coded e-mails she's stealing.
Yeah, I was right.
Okay, Spencer.
I can't send a page of numbers to the F.B.I. I need the code.
- Oh, I don't like this.
- Does she have it or not?
No, I don't see it.
Look though.
Look at this.
She wiped all her bank records within 24 hours of accessing the system.
Here.
Here again.
Every time she-
Spencer-Spencer, I need you to focus.
There's no point in her intercepting the e-mails if she can't decrypt them.
No, no
- Listen.
Every time there's a payment-
Yesterday, today... twice.
Oh, she sent two more names out.
Oh, I don't know where it's gonna happen next.
I don't know who's gonna die.
Two more, but-
Spencer, it's gonna be fine if you find the code.
Right now.
No, I told you.
It's not here.
She's too careful.
She must borrow the copy they keep in the SCI F room and put it back when she's done.
- Oh, God.
I should have seen it.
- Wait.
Now you're telling me that her copy of the code is in a SCI F room?
- That's a vault.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- The pattern
- I didn't see it.
I didn't see any of this.
- Get out of the chair!
Which brings us to the Finley Method-
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Are you leaving us?
- I have work to do.
- Folks, be right back.
Turn to page seven.
Hey, hey.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey.
Shannon-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey-
- I'm sending myself a copy of everything encrypted.
- Let's go.
- Let's hit the reset button.
Do it together.
Hit the button.
Let's reset the clock here.
No, no-We have to take the machines.
No, we have to take the machines.
- We have to find the names.
She could have buried it.
- Spencer!
No, we have to warn the Guardians.
No, we have to.
The darkness will come.
The darkness will come.
You'll see-You'll look up.
The stars will go out.
And every night- every night-
We can be positive, Shannon.
This is all about us-
- Team.
I. We.
- That's enough.
Shannon, you're killing me here.
Oh, come on.
Enough.
Come on, Spencer.
Come on.
They're all gonna die.
We don't have the code.
They're all gonna die.
I could
- I'll try to hack into Shannon's computer again remotely.
Yeah, if I leave the line open, maybe I can catch her when she uses the code.
You can't.
If you get caught, she can trace where you live and-
She sent more names.
We don't know who or where, but we know they're gonna die.
And those files you stole from her computer are useless without a copy of Zydeco.
- Well, that's not true.
We can use-
- There's no point in trying.
No, there's no use in even a- in even a- even attempting to break that code.
You understand?
The whole life of the universe.
- Listen.
Please-
- I know you're trying to help, but if you think... you can break into the SCIF room to steal that code-
No, I'm sorry.
That's never gonna happen.
- You see, there's a nine-digit keypad and-
- I'm not going to-
Shannon and her friends from Procyon "A" won't just sit back and watch.
Spencer, Michael isn't going to decrypt... the e-mails that Shannon stole.
He's going to use them as a prop to scare her.
No, I don't see that.
We're gonna convince her that someone's hunting for the leak.
She'll stop selling names, cover her tracks.
We'll tip the F.B.I. When she goes to erase the SCIF room's access code.
She'll be arrested.
No more spies die.
There's justice for your friend.
The alien goes to jail.
Oh, well, that sounds good.
Is that what you were gonna say?
If you wanna keep your job, keep walking and keep your voice down.
- And act casual.
- We don't have a Jeremy Dresner in Virginia.
I checked.
Who are you and-
The people we both work for don't know my name, and neither will you.
I'm the guy cleaning up your mess.
That's all you get.
What mess?
Two days ago, you were an I.T. Guy.
Two days ago, I was shaking the tree.
There's a leak coming from Tech.
That's your department.
We're staring down the barrel of a federal case and a massive P.R. Disaster.
Zydeco's compromised.
Three American operatives are already dead.
This is ridiculous.
I don't know who you are.
- I'm calling my boss.
- Go ahead.
Use mine... if you'd rather deal with a massive federal investigation.
Shannon, the feds are just sniffing at this now.
We got two days.
After that, your stock options won't be worth the paper they're printed on.
This doesn't make any sense.
That embassy system is airtight.
Zydeco was my project.
Believe me, honey, I know it was.
Where did you get that?
I need you to call upstairs, cancel all your appointments for the day.
There's something I need you to see.
Two weeks ago, I get a call from one of our employers.
One of your programmers in your department got himself blown up.
Brad Wilkins?
They asked me to have a look.
- Cops said that was an accident.
- Yeah.
Miami-Dade detectives make 56 grand a year.
How much do you think I make?
They didn't even know about this boat.
Your boy Brad had it registered under his mother's name.
- He was careful-just not careful enough.
- Where'd he get those?
That's what we're trying to find out.
Try to keep up, honey.
Notes in the margins.
Now, I learned about the leak because Brad found out about the leak.
He was hunting them.
Why he didn't share this news, I don't know.
- But he sure did get himself killed.
- What do the notes say?
He wanted to look at the SCI F access logs.
- Now I do.
- That's eyes only.
I'm not gonna show you that.
You absolutely will.
Tomorrow is Saturday.
There'll be nobody in the office.
You will meet me here at 10:00 so I know you're clean, then we go have a show-and-tell.
Cell phones are basically wireless computers.
- What is this?
- Upload the right program... and you've got a roving bug you can turn on remotely.
You will keep that on you.
If you need to talk to me before tomorrow morning... you will use that, not the office, not the home phone.
Last person who looked into this leak was killed.
You never know who's listening.
- What if we're not the only ones in the office?
- Tomorrow morning.
No excuses.
You be here.
We don't know who's listening.
- Guess we're up and running.
- 10 by 10.
Hey, how'd Virgil's boat work out?
Did I ever tell you about the marlin we caught off of Pigeon Key?
Yeah, a few times.
Hey, do you mind keeping an ear on Shannon tonight?
I gotta head down to the airport, see if I can't motivate our pal Diego.
Front companies generally make easy targets for burglary.
They don't want people wondering what they have to hide... so they tend not to install a lot of lights, alarms and security cameras.
And, of course, they'd never invite the police in to investigate... so there's really no need to be shy about leaving clues.
But you got to admit, it's elegant.
We catch Shannon wiping the access log tonight, and she goes tojail.
It's not the crime, it's the cover-up.
I understand the plan.
I just don't like it.
I wish we could forget about this "Catch her in the act, call the feds" nonsense... and drive to her house right now and finish this properly.
I should be home in bed right now.
Hey, hey, don't be dozing' off out there.
Freakin' amateur hour around here.
Yeah
- Hold on.
Yeah, it's Shannon.
Find it?
10437 Crest, right?
Sure you wanna do this?
I don't know.
You wanna get the needle?
I told you-There's heat on me at work.
An I.P. Address at that location tried to hack me- some nut from the office.
I am not taking chances.
We gotta tie this up cleanly.
You cannot be around-
I put a timer underneath the house.
Same as Brad.
Goes off at midnight.
I'll be long gone by then.
Good.
Then get off the phone.
Fi, did you hear that?
Spencer stuck his neck out, and she caught him.
Yeah.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to Spencer's.
I'm gonna have to leave the front door open here.
- What if she comes to wipe the access log?
- No.
Screw it.
He's all the way on the other side of town.
I can't get there.
You gotta go.
Hey, Sam.
Do you need some bowls?
Mike, you gotta get to Spencer's house.
Shannon set a bomb.
- It's under the house.
- It's gonna take me 25 minutes.
Well, Fi said 20.
I got my money on you, Mikey.
Get your ass in gear.
- Oh, no!
- Spencer!
No, you can't be here!
- Night is when they come!
- There's not time-
Fi, we've got a minute.
Come on.
You can't talk to him when he gets like that.
- If you're here-
- We missed her.
She's gonna erase everything.
Did you see the news?
Nobody was home.
I should have triggered the bomb in person.
Don't.
Do not second-guess me.
I took care of the thing at work.
We should be clear.
I'll call you.
On the phone.
Messages from Procyon "A" don't usually- No, they come on beams of light.
This must be a special occasion.
You know?
Desperate times.
- You tried to hack her files from your house, didn't you?
- Oh, yeah.
We were in such a rush before.
I thought if I took one more shot-
- Were they talking about killing me?
- We're gonna be all right.
Oh, no.
No.
No, no.
No, there's no way to catch her.
You heard her.
She wiped the evidence.
We're going to have to convince her to give us some new evidence.
Now that you're the only one she has reason to be afraid of... you're going to have to help.
Oh, no.
Oh, what are
- How?
Well, for starters, you're gonna have to be able to string two sentences together.
You're gonna have to talk to Shannon face to face.
You gotta be kidding me.
No, no, she's one of their leaders.
- Even the Guardians fear her.
- Spencer, this is really important.
You must stick to the script.
You cannot mention aliens, light beams or any of it.
Shannon can't find out we know what she is.
She can't find out that her cover's blown.
She'll call in for backup- all the other beings.
Okay, that makes sense.
There is no leak.
I checked the SCI F access log.
There's nothing.
I think we need to consider the possibility that Brad-
There is a leak, but we got bigger problems.
Somebody else found out.
I got a call this morning from a Spencer Watkowski.
You've seen him.
He waters plants at the office.
He's ex-N.S.A. He's a real heavy hitter.
That's impossible.
The guy
- He's a nut.
He's way off.
Yeah, nice cover, don't you think?
He wants to meet.
But what I can't figure out is why he wants you there with me.
Breathe, Spencer.
I said no surprises.
Why'd you bring a bodyguard?
Because she's the one who's selling names of American spies.
And she killed my friend Brad Wilkins, and she tried to kill me.
- You're the leak?
- It's not true.
It is true.
She's a murderer and a traitor.
Now, if you want this to be kept quiet, then I'm gonna need five million in cash.
- You don't have a shred of proof.
- Oh, yeah.
I know everything.
I know your whole dark plan.
And I know that you're one of them.
Ms. Park is one of those people who doesn't cover her tracks as well as they think.
Yesterday her password was "goldleaf1510. '"
Have you changed it yet, Shannon?
Oh, yeah.
You should see her computer.
She's got Zydeco-encrypted e-mails that look like this.
And when she decodes them, they look like that.
It's a fake.
He doesn't have the code.
He's bluffing.
Jesus, this is pathetic.
If you want to stay for this charade, you can.
I'm leaving.
I'm bluffing?
Then how do I know that you're setting up a deal... to sell another name to the Venezuelans?
Five million.
I'll bring the cash here at 10:00.
You bring a copy of everything you have.
Fine, but don't try and bring any backup.
- And don't bring any of your friends from Procyon.
- It'll just be me and the money.
Venezuela?
How did you-
Oh, the patterns.
Sometimes when you study them long enough-
Also, I saw a file labeled "Caracas" when I tried to hack her... but I couldn't get in, so-
I can't believe you're this stupid.
- You put a hit out on him?
Who else knows?
- A thug.
He's nobody.
I found him in a biker bar.
He knows nothing.
You're gonna give me his name and address.
I'm cleaning this up.
Why did you agree to pay them?
Why not just kill them too?
You really think I'm gonna pay them?
No, we're going back to the office.
You're gonna give me a copy of Zydeco.
I'm gonna pin that on their bodies along with some embassy e-mails-
- I don't understand.
What do you think-
- Are you really this slow?
It has to look like Spencer stole the code... and the e-mails from an embassy.
If the problem is on the client side, then we're protected.
Stone Kittredge stock doesn't take a hit.
I can't get into the SCI F room on a weekend without people finding out.
Do you really think you're gonna keep your job?
Today's your last day, honey.
You gotta run... and you're never gonna stop, you understand?
- Is that Zydeco?
- Yeah.
- Where are the e-mails?
- My computer, but we have to print them out... from a printer outside the building so the feds can't trace them.
- Yeah, I may skip that part.
- What-
Hey!
What-
This isn't good-bye.
I'll say hi at your trial.
No!
Hey!
Hey!
Let's see if this works.
This is Special AgentJohnson.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
This is, um-
Never mind.
I was just calling because there's a traitor...
- locked in the SCI F room at Stone Kittredge.
- What did you say?
Yeah, and there's a gig of state department e- mails on Shannon Park's computer... so you better get down here.
And you really should bring some backup.
That bitch is an alien.
Maybe he got abducted.
Hey!
Uh, sorry I'm late.
Thanks for meeting me.
I don't really trust the phone, so-
I wanted to be sure you saw the thing in the paper.
Shannon's copping a plea.
We saw it.
She's going to testify against the guy who killed Brad.
You ask me, something's wrong with the world when we don't hang traitors anymore.
- Doesn't seem right.
- Mmm.
You look good, Spencer.
Oh, really?
Well, I feel a little foggy, but-
The meds aren't great, but they come with the job, so- so it's worth it.
I hooked him up with a crypto gig.
Buddy of mine has a tech firm.
- How you likin' it, Spence?
- Oh, it's great.
It's great.
In fact, uh
- Oh, look.
I'm late.
- I should probably go.
- You know, I'll walk with you.
I have to make a stop myself.
And, you guys, thank you.
Thank you for, uh- for listening to me.
You probably shouldn't have listened to anything I said, but I'm glad you did.
Spencer?
- You got him a job.
- I actually am kind of a sweetheart.
So there's one more thing I wanted to tell you about all the aliens.
- Uh, Spencer, I thought that you were-
- Oh
- Oh, no, no.
L
- I know they're not real.
I just wanted to explain.
Well, in the beginning, the first messages-
This light in the window, this-this beautiful equation-
I should have just said something.
Yeah, I should have just told people.
But it was- it was all secret.
And in code.
And I didn't have anyone I could trust.
And you're lucky.
You're just lucky to have people like that.
Yeah.
Well, if there's ever anything I can do-
Yeah.
Hey.
I had some bowls like that once.
That is crazy.
I got this in an online auction.
Had to beat out some nasty Russians who were overbidding on everything.
I knew you liked Colombian art, so I thought... what better way to say I still want us to be friends?
Yes.
My bosses noticed your auction screen name.
"Michael Hearts Diego"?
You heard about that?
I'm embarrassed.
Nice choice you gave me.
Cop to the fact that I made contact with you, or admit to skimming... and accepting bribes from enemies of the state.
- Did you choose "A"?
- You're getting what you want.
I've been assigned to be your point of contact here in Miami.
You see?
Now you don't have to leave town.
No one has to lose.
It's a win-win.
Well, I get to win twice.
A new perk of myjob is that I get to tell you this-
The Company is not interested in your services at this time.
Really?
- Maybe you should show 'em this.
- They know.
Did you really think that would get you back in?
The boys upstairs don't want to pin a medal on anyone for that mess.
They want to sweep it under the rug.
Get to know me, Diego.
I'm not one of the bad guys.
Michael.
They did say they'd review your file.
I wouldn't hold my breath, but who knows?
Hi.
Hi.
So, tell me
- How did it go?
To be honest, I'm not sure.
They're gonna need some more convincing.
Even then, I don't know.
Whatever happens... one of us will be happy, I guess.
Why can't you be with me on this?
Talking to you is like talking to Spencer.
You're both so focused on one thing, it clouds everything else.
It's a crazy way to live, Michael.
You know what?
I am like Spencer.
We both see the world a certain way, and we both have skills to make it a better place.
That's not a bad thing.
I don't want to keep ducking this, so let me be straight with you.
This job, what we just did- saving American lives- this is the type of work I was made for, Fi.
It's what my old job gave me a chance to do every single day.
So, no, getting back in isn't just a way to survive or to protect the people I love.
It's what I want.
And if you truly care about me, you should damn well want for me what I want for myself.
If that's what you want...
I'll be with you.
I'll be with you.

My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until-
- We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
When you're burned, you've got nothing- no cash, no credit, no job history.
- You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you-
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend-
- Should we shoot them?
An old friend who used to inform on you to the F.B.I. -
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.
- Family too-
- Hey, is that your mom again?
- If you're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.
As long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
Nobody wants to hear from a burned spy.
Your old handlers send your calls straight to voice mail.
Your appeals are filed in the trash.
Your old contacts are worthless.
Your best bet is to find an active field operative who can't hang up on you.
If you're on domestic soil, the airport's not a bad place to look.
Intelligence agencies are like amateur magicians.
Watch closely, and you can see how they set up their tricks.
It doesn't matter how good they are at misdirection and sleight ofhand.
They can't make a covert ops supply plane disappear.
Four-U-M-Y-three-one-four.
Oh, Mikey.
You just wrecked the most amazing dream.
All these beautiful nachos were coming right- 4-U-M-Y-3-1-4.
Runway 3.
No flight plan, no problem?
Yep, and it's not a drug plane.
Had clearance from the tower.
It's got to be a black flight.
Bringing toys to all the good little spooks in Latin America.
Mike, please tell me this means I can go back to sleep alone in my own bed.
Is that how you celebrate these days, Sam?
Say it ain't so.
Fi.
Wow, you look-
Like I'm ready for lunch at the Delano.
I thought after a week of you eating fast food in the car with Sam... that you might like to take me.
I can't today.
I found a spy plane.
I got the tail number.
Why do you use that shot for fake I.D.'s?
It's like a bad prom picture.
I need to get some records from the F.A.A.
You need a driver's lic-
I think it makes me look trustworthy.
But I need to find out who owns the plane, who flies it, who registered it.
One of those people might be able to pull some strings, get me back in.
- And you have to find them immediately?
- Well, there's-
There's no time like the present.
It's time for Duane Winger to make his move.
Great.
I'm going to lunch.
Have fun getting your job back.
I know you don't like what I'm doing.
But you know it's not just about the job.
- You know that, right?
- Right.
It's about patriotism and duty.
And the sacred call of... whatever.
I was told that hell on earth would rain down on me without an umbrella.
I don't know, Duane.
Looks pretty sunny out there to me.
I'm gonna enjoy it.
Prom picture?
Here we go, Mr. Winger.
The plane you're asking about is owned by Executransport, Ltd.
Want to write it down?
You can borrow my pen.
How about you pull the whole file?
- Could I borrow that?
- Oh, you're bad.
We can't sign files out.
Everything back here is "look but don't touch."
That is a shame.
I'm gonna level with you.
I'm a P.I. Workin' a messy divorce.
Sleazebag hubby's hidin' a jet under a shell company.
One little copy sure would help.
Inspector Foster to Hangar 5.
It'd be our little secret, Miss-
Linda.
Will Duane Winger please report to Reception?
Duane Winger to Reception, please.
The guy just wanted a file.
What's the big deal?
The big deal is I just got a call from the deputy director.
That file was red flagged.
When you get cornered, there's a rush of adrenaline... as the fight-or-flight response kicks in.
In those moments, you can't listen to your body.
There are some circumstances when flightjust isn't the right option.
Fortunately, with a little training and the right kind ofhitch knot... all that adrenaline can make you capable of something pretty close to flight.
Doesn't help the landing though.
Barry wanted a thousand dollars just to look into the company that owned that plane?
Yeah.
Sorry, man.
He said to get the articles of incorporation... he's got to go up to the capital.
What, is he taking a cab to Tallahassee?
Barry?
No.
His mom is up there, so he's gotta see her.
The grand is like an annoyance tax.
Fair enough.
It'll be money well spent, Mikey.
You track down the spooks that are flying that plane... get 'em to call in a few favors, you might not be stuck in Miami that much longer.
And you won't have to buy me drinks after range practice.
Subtle, Sam.
That's me, Mike.
See the olive?
Not that I'm complaining, but where's Fi?
It's not like her to skip our little ritual...
- use any chance to pop off a few rounds.
- She wasn't too thrilled-
Hey, you!
Hey, you!
You in the sunglasses!
Hey, can I see that gun?
- Careful there.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I promise I won't hurt you.
- Oh, that's good.
- It's you.
I knew you existed.
- Who are you?
My name is Spencer.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I had to make sure it was you.
He's the guy, right?
He's some kind of special ops guy.
There are times in any spy's career when someone...
- somehow figures out who you are.
- I really need your help.
Usually the best approach is tojust put on a good poker face and deny everything.
- I think you have the wrong idea.
- No.
No, no, no, no.
I-I've been
- I've been monitoring the paper- certain items in the blotter- and crime rates, police band chatter.
- And it all adds up.
It becomes very clear.
- Not yet it doesn't.
No, the pattern-There's a pattern.
Y-You don't just have, oh, oh, hello... a series of controlled explosions here and a dip in violent crime there.
You have to ask yourself, "What is the connection?
Who is the connection?"
So I think to myself, "We're not talking about Spider-Man."
We're talking about a real guy who has to practice.
So I did a Fermi estimate, and I got 63% odds that he lives... within a five-mile radius of this gun range, so-
Once you see a pattern, you can't unsee it.
So you've been staking out the shooting range looking for-
You.
And your gun.
And your skills.
And-And that thing that you did with the- where you-
All that seems to confirm to me that you are the guy.
No, no.
You have to help me.
You're the guy.
What can I say?
I'm not the guy.
That's a lie.
You lied.
Very convincingly, as any trained operative would.
Listen.
You have to help me.
I don't want to make you, but I will if I have to.
Okay.
He's an operative!
This guy!
Very famous.
He's a rogue agent- special operatives guy.
Okay, okay, fine.
We're gonna talk.
Boy, are we gonna talk.
He's the spy.
So who are you?
Uh, no offense, Spencer, but who are you?
Oh, I'm a mathematician.
M.I.T.
- Did my doctoral work at Duke.
- You were saying you need help?
About a year ago I started to work at Stone Kittredge.
They do a lot of government contracts- construction, energy, tech.
Yeah, it's a defense firm.
We know 'em.
Well, I've seen some things there that I shouldn't have.
One of their vice presidents is a-well, a killer.
Okay, is this just some kind of a joke?
She's killed three already.
It's gonna happen again soon.
In Malaysia, if I had to guess.
Malaysia?
I'm not sure what's going on here, but do you have proof of something?
Not exactly, but how do you explain this?
I used my friend Brad's workstation to do some digging around in the system.
Two days later, the gas line at Brad's house blew up, and he was burned to death.
They thought he was onto them, so they killed my friend.
Calm down.
Let's back it up, Spencer.
Why were you using Brad's computer?
I-I don't have a computer at the office.
I'm-
I take care of the plants at Stone Kittredge.
- Ah.
There it is.
- I am too busy for a full-time job, okay?
Do you have any idea how many messages I have to decode every day?
Hundreds.
Do you think beings that advanced sleep?
I'm sorry. "Beings"?
Oh, oh.
Would you like me to say "aliens"?
The bad ones are from a nearby star system
- Procyon "A."
They-They take our form.
They encode their messages in beams of light.
Gorgeous mathematics wrapped around deadly messages.
But the Guardians- they are from a planet that orbits around Ross 154.
And-And they are being hunted.
Three of them are dead already.
- Every minute that we waste-
- Okay.
All right.
Just calm down a little bit here.
No, damn it!
There is no time!
Spencer, calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Uh, there's something I need right over here.
Sit down.
Sorry.
He started talking about aliens-
Uh, crazy stuff.
He thought I was a spy.
You know, likeJames Bond or something.
- And you guys sure you don't wanna file a report?
- Oh, no, no, no.
We just didn't want to see the guy hurt himself or anybody else.
Those are the magic words every time this guy goes to court.
- Oh, so he's been in before?
- Oh, yeah.
Dispatch told us that Mr. Watkowski here... has been in and out of the psych ward for the past four years.
Big-time schizo.
Sad stuff, but, guys, thanks.
Appreciate your help, all right?
- Take care.
- Well, if you're looking for a silver lining... it's nice to know that we can still call the cops, huh?
Can't believe he found me, Sam.
Don't worry, Mike.
Most people can't decode the secrets... hidden in beams of light.
I don't know about you, but I could use that drink now.
A money launderer's natural habitat... is near rich people.
What they save by avoiding taxes... they usually spend on overpriced drinks.
But meeting with them is never boring.
Jesus.
Mike.
Hi.
"Meet me at the Chadwick.
I'm poolside.
Bring cash."
This text doesn't even have a smiley face.
What happened to my friend Barry?
Hey, you know I don't like charging you, but that was a big favor.
I go up north, I gotta stay with my mom.
She's still mad at me I dropped out of podiatry school.
Makes me nuts.
Anyway, I needed to unwind.
The view here helps... a lot.
- Barry.
- Oh.
Okay.
Executransport, Ltd.
You're probably not gonna be shocked to hear that it's a shell company... and its registrants don't even exist.
Officially speaking, nobody owns the plane you saw.
- Not shocked, no.
- But it wasn't a total dead end though.
There's a real business tied to that plane?
North Andes Distribution.
They got a hangar over at the airport.
Probably packed the cargo on the very flight you saw.
Not bad, Barry.
Hey, listen, before you go, uh, you help me out here, Mike?
Do my back?
Hey, Mike.
Look who's back.
Hey, man.
Hey.
I'm so sorry to bother you at home, especially after-
I shouldn't have done that.
The table.
Your new friend was just explaining that he hacked the D.M. V... and found your place thanks to a parking ticket, of all things.
- He's really very clever.
- So... they let you out?
Well, they may as well have.
The nurses at that place... don't even disguise the pattern of the rounds, and the locks there are child's play.
Oh, there's no hard feelings.
I know you werejust testing me.
Spencer, you can't be here.
You're right.
We shouldn't be out in the open like this.
They're probably looking for me.
- The aliens?
- The police.
I broke out of a psych ward.
Weren't you listening?
Spencer, we can't do anything for you.
I know people think my mind's not right, but I am right.
I'm right about this.
They killed my friend Brad.
Please, just let me show you what I learned.
Hey, I found you, didn't I?
He doesn't seem that crazy to me.
All right, show us.
Okay.
I was wrong.
He's totally nuts.
Sorry about the
- Oh, there's something I really need to show you in the paper.
I can't find anything in this mess.
Yeah, sometimes I lose track of things when I leave them on the ceiling.
Ha!
No, that's-
Oh, okay, we can start there.
This is the one I was telling you about.
Three killed in the past four months.
- Just like I said.
- You said aliens.
- This looks like American spies.
- Well, the forms they take vary, but-
You're saying these men were outed by an executive at Stone Kittredge?
- Yes, that's what I'm saying.
- Wait a second.
Ronald Papa?
They said this was a climbing accident.
Mike, this guy was a friend of mine.
I mean, I worked with him.
Oh, oh, good.
So you worked with one of the Guardians.
No, don't do that.
I just sent flowers to Ron's wife... last month, so don't be making up stories about real people.
Oh, I'm not.
I lost a friend too.
My friend Brad.
The one they killed to cover it up.
The one I told you about.
See, you have to-You just have to read all these.
Please, just read them all.
Spencer, these are just a bunch of newspaper articles.
Oh, no, there's a pattern.
You have to see the pattern.
It's all connected.
There's a galactic war between these- the bad ones-
The ones from Procyon "A'" are hunting the Guardians.
And guys like Brad who get in the middle- they'll kill them.
And then the darkness will come.
Unless you
- It's up to you to stop them.
Spencer, I know this guy.
He's a good guy.
He's a good doctor.
I want you to meet him.
Whether you're infiltrating a cartel... or spiking a chemical weapons sale, the most dangerous people in any covert op... are the ones on your side.
If they crack, you end up in a shallow grave.
That's usually a good enough reason to avoid working with crazy people.
Mike.
Michael.
"Diplomat Found Dead in Malaysia."
But sometimes you have no choice.
Oh, that's the one, see?
It's like I told you.
It's today's paper.
It happened just like he said it would.
Mike, if aliens equal spies-
- What's wrong?
- Spencer, I was really hoping you were just crazy.
Okay, let me get this straight.
2007, Stone Kittredge gets the contract... to provide secure communications between American embassies.
So they do the usual firewall crap, plus they come up with a code.
- Called Zydeco, yes.
- Okay, and you think somebody there... is intercepting these encrypted e-mails... and selling the names of American spies- that's your bogus theory?
What these Procyon beings are really doing is exposing the Guardians from Ross 154.
Right.
Like my buddy Ronnie.
But how do you know it's somebody inside of Stone Kittredge... and not some whack-job on the outside who just cracked the code?
- Uh, that's absurd.
- Absurd... like "aliens are sending me messages through the PennySaver" absurd?
Zydeco's unbreakable.
It's a four-kilobyte code.
4K?
Mike, I got pictures of Miss Reynolds on my phone bigger than that.
No, an algorithmic code that takes up four kilobytes of space is beyond secure.
It would take longer than the whole life of the universe to crack it.
That-That's impossible.
Th-There's no way.
You'd really-
- You'd really need the code to read those messages.
- All right, fine.
Relax.
Maybe there's another way that we can do this.
- Will you sit down?
- No, no.
There she is.
That's her.
In the black.
That's Shannon Park.
Her team created Zydeco.
Think she kept a copy?
Yeah, and I know she has access to the embassy e-mail system.
That much I saw myself.
That's how my friend Brad got killed.
She thought he was onto her.
No, I'm telling you
- She's a murderer and a traitor.
And you can see how she takes our form.
But I swear, she's an alien.
Let's stick to Earth problems.
We need to look at Shannon's files.
If she has an unauthorized copy of Zydeco, we can get her busted.
No, y-you can't get into her system.
It's Fort Knox.
No, I-I-I tried to get in remotely and I couldn't do it.
We hit her office.
We bury a keystroke tracking program.
Come back the next day for her password.
We get the e-mails and the code.
No, no.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh, but she's-
No, look, these are very advanced beings.
She'd be able to tell if you were on her computer.
I-I think she's a little out of your league.
Okay, Mr. Computer.
Is she out of your league?
We need you to get us access at Stone Kittredge, Spencer.
Jeremy Dresner, consulting in I.T.
There should be a visitor badge in the system for me.
In medieval Europe... spies used to pose as lepers and plague victims... so they could snoop around without being bothered.
In today's corporate office, posing as I. T. Works the same way.
It's the perfect cover if you need to linger without being bothered.
And it gives you a pretext for talking to almost anyone.
Miss Park.
Jeremy Dresner, I.T., Alexandria office.
I need to speak with you.
- Great.
Make an appointment.
- No problem.
How about now?
Excuse me?
We're doing an internal audit of security procedures.
I have the paperwork right here.
We were told your whole department... would be cooperative, Ms. Park.
Well, that's funny, Jeremy.
'Cause I'm the head of this department... and nobody's said word one to me.
Well, here I am, and we're way past word one now.
Security is our business on this wing.
Your business is installing software upgrades.
So I suggest you have somebody up on 14 give me a call about this...
- and I suggest they send somebody else next time.
- Oh, I bet they will.
I bet they'll send you up to see me, Shannon.
I'm looking forward to it.
Can I borrow your bathroom key?
You're my hero.
All you need to beat a modern tumbler lock... is a little information and some Stone Age tools.
If you know the basic type ofkey you need to spoof, pick out a matching blank... file down the valleys to the center ledge... and you have a bump key.
Apply torque, whack it with anything handy, and you're in.
Not quite as much fun as kicking a door down.
You ready to go?
To dinner?
It's 4:30.
I told you, no more early-bird specials.
Yeah, I thought we would stop by the airport first...
- pay a visit to that front business Barry found.
- More spy hunting?
Michael, why must everything you do revolve around getting your old job back?
- Fiona, really.
This is important.
- Oh, Michael, come on.
I'll do it alone.
We're gonna have to do this eventually.
Yeah.
Just not right now.
Drug cartels aren't the only organizations... who use import-export businesses as fronts.
Intelligence agencies like them because... they make it possible for missions to finance themselves.
Who parked that gray truck out there?
Where's your boss?
They send out guns and supplies and get back goods to sell.
Native antiquities are favorites... because their subjective prices make money laundering easy.
You the manager?
No, Mr. Westen.
I'm Diego Garza.
I'm the spy you're looking for.
You're really not supposed to tell people you're a spy.
What's the point in subterfuge?
All the memos they send from D.C., they say you're very, very good.
I have to assume you're here because you want back in.
Trying to reach out?
I like you, Diego.
You're doing all the work for me.
I don't want this to hurt your feelings... but I'd really like you to get the hell out of here.
Not everything they told you about me is true.
Well, the part about me being really, really good, but-
I just want to talk to your bosses so we can clear this up.
I wish it was that simple.
I have 20 years at the Company.
I've seen villages burned.
I've seen children orphaned.
I've been shot twice.
Then they transferred me here.
Now, you know what the hardest part of this job is?
That forklift turns funny.
Now, if I report back that I made contact with a burned spy... do you know where they'll send me?
Me neither.
And I'm not rocking this boat.
I'm giving you a chance to be a friend.
Mr. Westen, I don't like threats.
But I love your sunglasses.
You have a good one, okay?
Doing a job in broad daylight... means easier access but more witnesses.
You can walk right in with your unwanted audience... but you better have a plan to entertain them.
Well, all right, ladies and gentlemen.
If I can borrow your attention, I promise to return it in about an hour.
My name is Charles Finley.
You can call me Charles.
I know.
I'm the dreaded teamwork consultant that popped up on your calendar there.
So, come on, everybody.
Follow me into the conference room right now.
Let's go.
- There's gonna be ice cream cake.
It's my birthday.
Let's go.
Come on.
Did I mention ice cream cake?
Come on, folks.
Come on.
Break free from your cubicle, huh?
That's the ticket.
Whoa, ho!
They warned me about you, Ms. Park.
- I don't have time for this.
- Oh, now, come on, boss lady.
Let's be a good example for everybody, huh?
What do you say?
Hey, folks.
Let's do this thing.
Have they all been taken?
Yeah, to the conference room.
Enhancing Your Empowerment Sphere."
Let's make this quick.
Has anyone here heard of the Seventh Sigma?
This is the newest commandment in the business bible, people.
Anyone?
- Todd.
- "Thou shalt not lie about ice cream cake"?
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, Todd.
You're a joker, Todd.
You're gonna stay after class.
See, that's all
- Do you see that?
That encryption is Zydeco.
Those are all-She shouldn't have those.
Those are all coded e-mails she's stealing.
Yeah, I was right.
Okay, Spencer.
I can't send a page of numbers to the F.B.I. I need the code.
- Oh, I don't like this.
- Does she have it or not?
No, I don't see it.
Look though.
Look at this.
She wiped all her bank records within 24 hours of accessing the system.
Here.
Here again.
Every time she-
Spencer-Spencer, I need you to focus.
There's no point in her intercepting the e-mails if she can't decrypt them.
No, no
- Listen.
Every time there's a payment-
Yesterday, today... twice.
Oh, she sent two more names out.
Oh, I don't know where it's gonna happen next.
I don't know who's gonna die.
Two more, but-
Spencer, it's gonna be fine if you find the code.
Right now.
No, I told you.
It's not here.
She's too careful.
She must borrow the copy they keep in the SCI F room and put it back when she's done.
- Oh, God.
I should have seen it.
- Wait.
Now you're telling me that her copy of the code is in a SCI F room?
- That's a vault.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- The pattern
- I didn't see it.
I didn't see any of this.
- Get out of the chair!
Which brings us to the Finley Method-
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Are you leaving us?
- I have work to do.
- Folks, be right back.
Turn to page seven.
Hey, hey.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey.
Shannon-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey-
- I'm sending myself a copy of everything encrypted.
- Let's go.
- Let's hit the reset button.
Do it together.
Hit the button.
Let's reset the clock here.
No, no-We have to take the machines.
No, we have to take the machines.
- We have to find the names.
She could have buried it.
- Spencer!
No, we have to warn the Guardians.
No, we have to.
The darkness will come.
The darkness will come.
You'll see-You'll look up.
The stars will go out.
And every night- every night-
We can be positive, Shannon.
This is all about us-
- Team.
I. We.
- That's enough.
Shannon, you're killing me here.
Oh, come on.
Enough.
Come on, Spencer.
Come on.
They're all gonna die.
We don't have the code.
They're all gonna die.
I could
- I'll try to hack into Shannon's computer again remotely.
Yeah, if I leave the line open, maybe I can catch her when she uses the code.
You can't.
If you get caught, she can trace where you live and-
She sent more names.
We don't know who or where, but we know they're gonna die.
And those files you stole from her computer are useless without a copy of Zydeco.
- Well, that's not true.
We can use-
- There's no point in trying.
No, there's no use in even a- in even a- even attempting to break that code.
You understand?
The whole life of the universe.
- Listen.
Please-
- I know you're trying to help, but if you think... you can break into the SCIF room to steal that code-
No, I'm sorry.
That's never gonna happen.
- You see, there's a nine-digit keypad and-
- I'm not going to-
Shannon and her friends from Procyon "A" won't just sit back and watch.
Spencer, Michael isn't going to decrypt... the e-mails that Shannon stole.
He's going to use them as a prop to scare her.
No, I don't see that.
We're gonna convince her that someone's hunting for the leak.
She'll stop selling names, cover her tracks.
We'll tip the F.B.I. When she goes to erase the SCIF room's access code.
She'll be arrested.
No more spies die.
There's justice for your friend.
The alien goes to jail.
Oh, well, that sounds good.
Is that what you were gonna say?
If you wanna keep your job, keep walking and keep your voice down.
- And act casual.
- We don't have a Jeremy Dresner in Virginia.
I checked.
Who are you and-
The people we both work for don't know my name, and neither will you.
I'm the guy cleaning up your mess.
That's all you get.
What mess?
Two days ago, you were an I.T. Guy.
Two days ago, I was shaking the tree.
There's a leak coming from Tech.
That's your department.
We're staring down the barrel of a federal case and a massive P.R. Disaster.
Zydeco's compromised.
Three American operatives are already dead.
This is ridiculous.
I don't know who you are.
- I'm calling my boss.
- Go ahead.
Use mine... if you'd rather deal with a massive federal investigation.
Shannon, the feds are just sniffing at this now.
We got two days.
After that, your stock options won't be worth the paper they're printed on.
This doesn't make any sense.
That embassy system is airtight.
Zydeco was my project.
Believe me, honey, I know it was.
Where did you get that?
I need you to call upstairs, cancel all your appointments for the day.
There's something I need you to see.
Two weeks ago, I get a call from one of our employers.
One of your programmers in your department got himself blown up.
Brad Wilkins?
They asked me to have a look.
- Cops said that was an accident.
- Yeah.
Miami-Dade detectives make 56 grand a year.
How much do you think I make?
They didn't even know about this boat.
Your boy Brad had it registered under his mother's name.
- He was careful-just not careful enough.
- Where'd he get those?
That's what we're trying to find out.
Try to keep up, honey.
Notes in the margins.
Now, I learned about the leak because Brad found out about the leak.
He was hunting them.
Why he didn't share this news, I don't know.
- But he sure did get himself killed.
- What do the notes say?
He wanted to look at the SCI F access logs.
- Now I do.
- That's eyes only.
I'm not gonna show you that.
You absolutely will.
Tomorrow is Saturday.
There'll be nobody in the office.
You will meet me here at 10:00 so I know you're clean, then we go have a show-and-tell.
Cell phones are basically wireless computers.
- What is this?
- Upload the right program... and you've got a roving bug you can turn on remotely.
You will keep that on you.
If you need to talk to me before tomorrow morning... you will use that, not the office, not the home phone.
Last person who looked into this leak was killed.
You never know who's listening.
- What if we're not the only ones in the office?
- Tomorrow morning.
No excuses.
You be here.
We don't know who's listening.
- Guess we're up and running.
- 10 by 10.
Hey, how'd Virgil's boat work out?
Did I ever tell you about the marlin we caught off of Pigeon Key?
Yeah, a few times.
Hey, do you mind keeping an ear on Shannon tonight?
I gotta head down to the airport, see if I can't motivate our pal Diego.
Front companies generally make easy targets for burglary.
They don't want people wondering what they have to hide... so they tend not to install a lot of lights, alarms and security cameras.
And, of course, they'd never invite the police in to investigate... so there's really no need to be shy about leaving clues.
But you got to admit, it's elegant.
We catch Shannon wiping the access log tonight, and she goes tojail.
It's not the crime, it's the cover-up.
I understand the plan.
I just don't like it.
I wish we could forget about this "Catch her in the act, call the feds" nonsense... and drive to her house right now and finish this properly.
I should be home in bed right now.
Hey, hey, don't be dozing' off out there.
Freakin' amateur hour around here.
Yeah
- Hold on.
Yeah, it's Shannon.
Find it?
10437 Crest, right?
Sure you wanna do this?
I don't know.
You wanna get the needle?
I told you-There's heat on me at work.
An I.P. Address at that location tried to hack me- some nut from the office.
I am not taking chances.
We gotta tie this up cleanly.
You cannot be around-
I put a timer underneath the house.
Same as Brad.
Goes off at midnight.
I'll be long gone by then.
Good.
Then get off the phone.
Fi, did you hear that?
Spencer stuck his neck out, and she caught him.
Yeah.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to Spencer's.
I'm gonna have to leave the front door open here.
- What if she comes to wipe the access log?
- No.
Screw it.
He's all the way on the other side of town.
I can't get there.
You gotta go.
Hey, Sam.
Do you need some bowls?
Mike, you gotta get to Spencer's house.
Shannon set a bomb.
- It's under the house.
- It's gonna take me 25 minutes.
Well, Fi said 20.
I got my money on you, Mikey.
Get your ass in gear.
- Oh, no!
- Spencer!
No, you can't be here!
- Night is when they come!
- There's not time-
Fi, we've got a minute.
Come on.
You can't talk to him when he gets like that.
- If you're here-
- We missed her.
She's gonna erase everything.
Did you see the news?
Nobody was home.
I should have triggered the bomb in person.
Don't.
Do not second-guess me.
I took care of the thing at work.
We should be clear.
I'll call you.
On the phone.
Messages from Procyon "A" don't usually- No, they come on beams of light.
This must be a special occasion.
You know?
Desperate times.
- You tried to hack her files from your house, didn't you?
- Oh, yeah.
We were in such a rush before.
I thought if I took one more shot-
- Were they talking about killing me?
- We're gonna be all right.
Oh, no.
No.
No, no.
No, there's no way to catch her.
You heard her.
She wiped the evidence.
We're going to have to convince her to give us some new evidence.
Now that you're the only one she has reason to be afraid of... you're going to have to help.
Oh, no.
Oh, what are
- How?
Well, for starters, you're gonna have to be able to string two sentences together.
You're gonna have to talk to Shannon face to face.
You gotta be kidding me.
No, no, she's one of their leaders.
- Even the Guardians fear her.
- Spencer, this is really important.
You must stick to the script.
You cannot mention aliens, light beams or any of it.
Shannon can't find out we know what she is.
She can't find out that her cover's blown.
She'll call in for backup- all the other beings.
Okay, that makes sense.
There is no leak.
I checked the SCI F access log.
There's nothing.
I think we need to consider the possibility that Brad-
There is a leak, but we got bigger problems.
Somebody else found out.
I got a call this morning from a Spencer Watkowski.
You've seen him.
He waters plants at the office.
He's ex-N.S.A. He's a real heavy hitter.
That's impossible.
The guy
- He's a nut.
He's way off.
Yeah, nice cover, don't you think?
He wants to meet.
But what I can't figure out is why he wants you there with me.
Breathe, Spencer.
I said no surprises.
Why'd you bring a bodyguard?
Because she's the one who's selling names of American spies.
And she killed my friend Brad Wilkins, and she tried to kill me.
- You're the leak?
- It's not true.
It is true.
She's a murderer and a traitor.
Now, if you want this to be kept quiet, then I'm gonna need five million in cash.
- You don't have a shred of proof.
- Oh, yeah.
I know everything.
I know your whole dark plan.
And I know that you're one of them.
Ms. Park is one of those people who doesn't cover her tracks as well as they think.
Yesterday her password was "goldleaf1510. '"
Have you changed it yet, Shannon?
Oh, yeah.
You should see her computer.
She's got Zydeco-encrypted e-mails that look like this.
And when she decodes them, they look like that.
It's a fake.
He doesn't have the code.
He's bluffing.
Jesus, this is pathetic.
If you want to stay for this charade, you can.
I'm leaving.
I'm bluffing?
Then how do I know that you're setting up a deal... to sell another name to the Venezuelans?
Five million.
I'll bring the cash here at 10:00.
You bring a copy of everything you have.
Fine, but don't try and bring any backup.
- And don't bring any of your friends from Procyon.
- It'll just be me and the money.
Venezuela?
How did you-
Oh, the patterns.
Sometimes when you study them long enough-
Also, I saw a file labeled "Caracas" when I tried to hack her... but I couldn't get in, so-
I can't believe you're this stupid.
- You put a hit out on him?
Who else knows?
- A thug.
He's nobody.
I found him in a biker bar.
He knows nothing.
You're gonna give me his name and address.
I'm cleaning this up.
Why did you agree to pay them?
Why not just kill them too?
You really think I'm gonna pay them?
No, we're going back to the office.
You're gonna give me a copy of Zydeco.
I'm gonna pin that on their bodies along with some embassy e-mails-
- I don't understand.
What do you think-
- Are you really this slow?
It has to look like Spencer stole the code... and the e-mails from an embassy.
If the problem is on the client side, then we're protected.
Stone Kittredge stock doesn't take a hit.
I can't get into the SCI F room on a weekend without people finding out.
Do you really think you're gonna keep your job?
Today's your last day, honey.
You gotta run... and you're never gonna stop, you understand?
- Is that Zydeco?
- Yeah.
- Where are the e-mails?
- My computer, but we have to print them out... from a printer outside the building so the feds can't trace them.
- Yeah, I may skip that part.
- What-
Hey!
What-
This isn't good-bye.
I'll say hi at your trial.
No!
Hey!
Hey!
Let's see if this works.
This is Special Agentjohnson.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
This is, um-
Never mind.
I was just calling because there's a traitor...
- locked in the SCI F room at Stone Kittredge.
- What did you say?
Yeah, and there's a gig of state department e-mails on Shannon Park's computer... so you better get down here.
And you really should bring some backup.
That bitch is an alien.
Maybe he got abducted.
Hey!
Uh, sorry I'm late.
Thanks for meeting me.
I don't really trust the phone, so-
I wanted to be sure you saw the thing in the paper.
Shannon's copping a plea.
We saw it.
She's going to testify against the guy who killed Brad.
You ask me, something's wrong with the world when we don't hang traitors anymore.
- Doesn't seem right.
- Mmm.
You look good, Spencer.
Oh, really?
Well, I feel a little foggy, but-
The meds aren't great, but they come with the job, so- so it's worth it.
I hooked him up with a crypto gig.
Buddy of mine has a tech firm.
- How you likin' it, Spence?
- Oh, it's great.
It's great.
In fact, uh
- Oh, look.
I'm late.
- I should probably go.
- You know, I'll walk with you.
I have to make a stop myself.
And, you guys, thank you.
Thank you for, uh- for listening to me.
You probably shouldn't have listened to anything I said, but I'm glad you did.
Spencer?
- You got him a job.
- I actually am kind of a sweetheart.
So there's one more thing I wanted to tell you about all the aliens.
- Uh, Spencer, I thought that you were-
- Oh
- Oh, no, no.
I-I know they're not real.
I just wanted to explain.
Well, in the beginning, the first messages-
This light in the window, this-this beautiful equation-
I should have just said something.
Yeah, I should have just told people.
But it was- it was all secret.
And in code.
And I didn't have anyone I could trust.
And you're lucky.
You're just lucky to have people like that.
Yeah.
Well, if there's ever anything I can do-
Yeah.
Hey.
I had some bowls like that once.
That is crazy.
I got this in an online auction.
Had to beat out some nasty Russians who were overbidding on everything.
I knew you liked Colombian art, so I thought... what better way to say I still want us to be friends?
Yes.
My bosses noticed your auction screen name.
"Michael Hearts Diego"?
You heard about that?
I'm embarrassed.
Nice choice you gave me.
Cop to the fact that I made contact with you, or admit to skimming... and accepting bribes from enemies of the state.
- Did you choose "A"?
- You're getting what you want.
I've been assigned to be your point of contact here in Miami.
You see?
Now you don't have to leave town.
No one has to lose.
It's a win-win.
Well, I get to win twice.
A new perk of myjob is that I get to tell you this-
The Company is not interested in your services at this time.
Really?
- Maybe you should show 'em this.
- They know.
Did you really think that would get you back in?
The boys upstairs don't want to pin a medal on anyone for that mess.
They want to sweep it under the rug.
Get to know me, Diego.
I'm not one of the bad guys.
Michael.
They did say they'd review your file.
I wouldn't hold my breath, but who knows?
Hi.
Hi.
So, tell me
- How did it go?
To be honest, I'm not sure.
They're gonna need some more convincing.
Even then, I don't know.
Whatever happens... one of us will be happy, I guess.
Why can't you be with me on this?
Talking to you is like talking to Spencer.
You're both so focused on one thing, it clouds everything else.
It's a crazy way to live, Michael.
You know what?
I am like Spencer.
We both see the world a certain way, and we both have skills to make it a better place.
That's not a bad thing.
I don't want to keep ducking this, so let me be straight with you.
This job, what we just did- saving American lives- this is the type of work I was made for, Fi.
It's what my old job gave me a chance to do every single day.
So, no, getting back in isn't just a way to survive or to protect the people I love.
It's what I want.
And if you truly care about me, you should damn well want for me what I want for myself.
If that's what you want...
I'll be with you.
I'll be with you.
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
- We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted. -
When you're burned, you've got nothing... no cash, no credit, no job history.
- You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you...
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?
An old friend who used to inform on you to the F.B. I...
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.
- Family too...
- Hey, is that your mom again?
- If you're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.
As long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
Nobody wants to hear from a burned spy.
Your old handlers send your calls straight to voice mail.
Your appeals are filed in the trash.
Your old contacts are worthless.
Your best bet is to find an active field operative who can't hang up on you.
If you're on domestic soil, the airport's not a bad place to look.
Intelligence agencies are like amateur magicians.
Watch closely, and you can see how they set up their tricks.
It doesn't matter how good they are at misdirection and sleight of hand.
They can't make a covert ops supply plane disappear.
Four-U-M-Y-three-one-four.
Oh, Mikey.
You just wrecked the most amazing dream.
All these beautiful nachos were coming right... 4-U-M-Y-3-1-4.
Runway 3.
No flight plan, no problem?
Yep, and it's not a drug plane.
Had clearance from the tower.
It's got to be a black flight.
Bringing toys to all the good little spooks in Latin America.
Mike, please tell me this means I can go back to sleep alone in my own bed.
Is that how you celebrate these days, Sam?
Say it ain't so.
Fi.
Wow, you look...
Like I'm ready for lunch at the Delano.
I thought after a week of you eating fast food in the car with Sam... that you might like to take me.
I can't today.
I found a spy plane.
I got the tail number.
Why do you use that shot for fake I.D.'s?
It's like a bad prom picture.
I need to get some records from the F.A.A.
You need a driver's lic...
I think it makes me look trustworthy.
But I need to find out who owns the plane, who flies it, who registered it.
One of those people might be able to pull some strings, get me back in.
- And you have to find them immediately?
- Well, there's...
There's no time like the present.
It's time for Duane Winger to make his move.
Great.
I'm going to lunch.
Have fun getting your job back.
I know you don't like what I'm doing.
But you know it's not just about the job.
- You know that, right?
- Right.
It's about patriotism and duty.
And the sacred call of... whatever.
I was told that hell on earth would rain down on me without an umbrella.
I don't know, Duane.
Looks pretty sunny out there to me.
I'm gonna enjoy it.
- Prom picture?
Here we go, Mr. Winger.
The plane you're asking about is owned by Executransport, Ltd.
Want to write it down?
You can borrow my pen.
How about you pull the whole file?
- Could I borrow that?
- Oh, you're bad.
We can't sign files out.
Everything back here is "look but don't touch."
That is a shame.
I'm gonna level with you.
I'm a P.I. Workin' a messy divorce.
Sleazebag hubby's hidin' a jet under a shell company.
One little copy sure would help.
Inspector Foster to Hangar 5.
It'd be our little secret, Miss...
Linda.
Will Duane Winger please report to Reception?
Duane Winger to Reception, please.
The guy just wanted a file.
What's the big deal?
The big deal is I just got a call from the deputy director.
That file was red flagged.
When you get cornered, there's a rush of adrenaline... as the fight-or-flight response kicks in.
In those moments, you can't listen to your body.
There are some circumstances when flight just isn't the right option.
Fortunately, with a little training and the right kind of hitch knot... all that adrenaline can make you capable of something pretty close to flight.
Doesn't help the landing though.
Barry wanted a thousand dollars just to look into the company that owned that plane?
Yeah.
Sorry, man.
He said to get the articles of incorporation... he's got to go up to the capital.
- What, is he taking a cab to Tallahassee?
Barry?
No.
His mom is up there, so he's gotta see her.
The grand is like an annoyance tax.
Fair enough.
It'll be money well spent, Mikey.
You track down the spooks that are flying that plane... get 'em to call in a few favors, you might not be stuck in Miami that much longer.
And you won't have to buy me drinks after range practice.
Subtle, Sam.
That's me, Mike.
See the olive?
Not that I'm complaining, but where's Fi?
It's not like her to skip our little ritual...
- use any chance to pop off a few rounds.
- She wasn't too thrilled...
Hey, you!
Hey, you!
You in the sunglasses!
Hey, can I see that gun?
- Careful there.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I promise I won't hurt you.
- Oh, that's good.
- It's you.
I knew you existed.
- Who are you?
My name is Spencer.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I had to make sure it was you.
He's the guy, right?
He's some kind of special ops guy.
There are times in any spy's career when someone...
- somehow figures out who you are.
- I really need your help.
Usually the best approach is to just put on a good poker face and deny everything.
- I think you have the wrong idea.
- No.
No, no, no, no.
L-I've been...
I've been monitoring the paper... certain items in the blotter...
and crime rates, police band chatter.
- And it all adds up.
It becomes very clear.
- Not yet it doesn't.
No, the pattern...
There's a pattern.
Y-You don't just have, oh, oh, hello... a series of controlled explosions here and a dip in violent crime there.
You have to ask yourself, "What is the connection?
Who is the connection?"
So I think to myself, "We're not talking about Spider-Man."
We're talking about a real guy who has to practice.
So I did a Fermi estimate, and I got 63% odds that he lives... within a five-mile radius of this gun range, so...
Once you see a pattern, you can't unsee it.
So you've been staking out the shooting range looking for...
You.
And your gun.
And your skills.
And...
And that thing that you did with the...
where you...
All that seems to confirm to me that you are the guy.
No, no.
You have to help me.
You're the guy.
What can I say?
I'm not the guy.
That's a lie.
You lied.
Very convincingly, as any trained operative would.
Listen.
You have to help me.
I don't want to make you, but I will if I have to.
Okay.
He's an operative!
This guy!
Very famous.
He's a rogue agent...
special operatives guy.
Okay, okay, fine.
We're gonna talk.
Boy, are we gonna talk.
He's the spy.
So who are you?
Uh, no offense, Spencer, but who are you?
Oh, I'm a mathematician.
M.I.T.
- Did my doctoral work at Duke.
- You were saying you need help?
About a year ago I started to work at Stone Kittredge.
They do a lot of government contracts...
construction, energy, tech.
Yeah, it's a defense firm.
We know 'em.
Well, I've seen some things there that I shouldn't have.
One of their vice presidents is a... well, a killer.
Okay, is this just some kind of a joke?
She's killed three already.
It's gonna happen again soon.
In Malaysia, if I had to guess.
Malaysia?
I'm not sure what's going on here, but do you have proof of something?
Not exactly, but how do you explain this?
I used my friend Brad's workstation to do some digging around in the system.
Two days later, the gas line at Brad's house blew up, and he was burned to death.
They thought he was onto them, so they killed my friend.
Calm down.
Let's back it up, Spencer.
Why were you using Brad's computer?
L-I don't have a computer at the office.
I'm...
I take care of the plants at Stone Kittredge.
- Ah.
There it is.
- I am too busy for a full-time job, okay?
Do you have any idea how many messages I have to decode every day?
Hundreds.
Do you think beings that advanced sleep?
I'm sorry. "Beings"?
Oh, oh.
Would you like me to say "aliens"?
The bad ones are from a nearby star system...
Procyon "A."
They-They take our form.
They encode their messages in beams of light.
Gorgeous mathematics wrapped around deadly messages.
But the Guardians... they are from a planet that orbits around Ross 154.
And-And they are being hunted.
Three of them are dead already.
- Every minute that we waste...
- Okay.
All right.
Just calm down a little bit here.
No, damn it!
There is no time!
Spencer, calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Uh, there's something I need right over here.
Sit down.
Sorry.
He started talking about aliens...
Uh, crazy stuff.
He thought I was a spy.
You know, like James Bond or something.
- And you guys sure you don't wanna file a report?
- Oh, no, no, no.
We just didn't want to see the guy hurt himself or anybody else.
Those are the magic words every time this guy goes to court.
- Oh, so he's been in before?
- Oh, yeah.
Dispatch told us that Mr. Watkowski here... has been in and out of the psych ward for the past four years.
Big-time schizo.
Sad stuff, but, guys, thanks.
Appreciate your help, all right?
- Take care.
- Well, if you're looking for a silver lining... it's nice to know that we can still call the cops, huh?
Can't believe he found me, Sam.
Don't worry, Mike.
Most people can't decode the secrets... hidden in beams of light.
I don't know about you, but I could use that drink now.
A money launderer's natural habitat... is near rich people.
What they save by avoiding taxes... they usually spend on overpriced drinks.
But meeting with them is never boring.
Jesus.
Mike.
Hi.
"Meet me at the Chadwick.
I'm poolside.
Bring cash."
This text doesn't even have a smiley face.
What happened to my friend Barry?
Hey, you know I don't like charging you, but that was a big favor.
I go up north, I gotta stay with my mom.
She's still mad at me I dropped out of podiatry school.
Makes me nuts.
Anyway, I needed to unwind.
The view here helps... a lot.
- Barry.
- Oh.
Okay.
Executransport, Ltd.
You're probably not gonna be shocked to hear that it's a shell company... and its registrants don't even exist.
Officially speaking, nobody owns the plane you saw.
- Not shocked, no.
- But it wasn't a total dead end though.
There's a real business tied to that plane?
North Andes Distribution.
They got a hangar over at the airport.
Probably packed the cargo on the very flight you saw.
Not bad, Barry.
Hey, listen, before you go, uh, you help me out here, Mike?
Do my back?
Hey, Mike.
Look who's back.
Hey, man.
Hey.
I'm so sorry to bother you at home, especially after...
I shouldn't have done that.
The table.
Your new friend was just explaining that he hacked the D.M. V... and found your place thanks to a parking ticket, of all things.
- He's really very clever.
- So... they let you out?
Well, they may as well have.
The nurses at that place... don't even disguise the pattern of the rounds, and the locks there are child's play.
Oh, there's no hard feelings.
I know you were just testing me.
Spencer, you can't be here.
You're right.
We shouldn't be out in the open like this.
They're probably looking for me.
- The aliens?
- The police.
I broke out of a psych ward.
Weren't you listening?
Spencer, we can't do anything for you.
I know people think my mind's not right, but I am right.
I'm right about this.
They killed my friend Brad.
Please, just let me show you what I learned.
Hey, I found you, didn't I?
He doesn't seem that crazy to me.
All right, show us.
Okay.
I was wrong.
He's totally nuts.
Sorry about the...
Oh, there's something I really need to show you in the paper.
I can't find anything in this mess.
Yeah, sometimes I lose track of things when I leave them on the ceiling.
Ha!
No, that's...
Oh, okay, we can start there.
This is the one I was telling you about.
Three killed in the past four months.
- Just like I said.
- You said aliens.
- This looks like American spies.
- Well, the forms they take vary, but...
You're saying these men were outed by an executive at Stone Kittredge?
- Yes, that's what I'm saying.
- Wait a second.
Ronald Papa?
They said this was a climbing accident.
Mike, this guy was a friend of mine.
I mean, I worked with him.
Oh, oh, good.
So you worked with one of the Guardians.
No, don't do that.
I just sent flowers to Ron's wife... last month, so don't be making up stories about real people.
Oh, I'm not.
I lost a friend too.
My friend Brad.
The one they killed to cover it up.
The one I told you about.
See, you have to...
You just have to read all these.
Please, just read them all.
Spencer, these are just a bunch of newspaper articles.
Oh, no, there's a pattern.
You have to see the pattern.
It's all connected.
There's a galactic war between these...
the bad ones...
The ones from Procyon "A'" are hunting the Guardians.
And guys like Brad who get in the middle...
they'll kill them.
And then the darkness will come.
Unless you...
It's up to you to stop them.
Spencer, I know this guy.
He's a good guy.
He's a good doctor.
I want you to meet him.
Whether you're infiltrating a cartel... or spiking a chemical weapons sale, the most dangerous people in any covert op... are the ones on your side.
If they crack, you end up in a shallow grave.
That's usually a good enough reason to avoid working with crazy people.
Mike.
Michael.
"Diplomat Found Dead in Malaysia."
But sometimes you have no choice.
Oh, that's the one, see?
It's like I told you.
It's today's paper.
It happened just like he said it would.
Mike, if aliens equal spies...
- What's wrong?
- Spencer, I was really hoping you were just crazy.
##
# Yeah ##
Okay, let me get this straight.
2007, Stone Kittredge gets the contract... to provide secure communications between American embassies.
So they do the usual firewall crap, plus they come up with a code.
- Called Zydeco, yes.
- Okay, and you think somebody there... is intercepting these encrypted e-mails... and selling the names of American spies...
that's your bogus theory?
What these Procyon beings are really doing is exposing the Guardians from Ross 154.
Right.
Like my buddy Ronnie.
But how do you know it's somebody inside of Stone Kittredge... and not some whack-job on the outside who just cracked the code?
- Uh, that's absurd.
- Absurd... like "aliens are sending me messages through the PennySaver" absurd?
Zydeco's unbreakable.
It's a four-kilobyte code.
4K?
Mike, I got pictures of Miss Reynolds on my phone bigger than that.
No, an algorithmic code that takes up four kilobytes of space is beyond secure.
It would take longer than the whole life of the universe to crack it.
That...
That's impossible.
Th-There's no way.
You'd really...
- You'd really need the code to read those messages.
- All right, fine.
Relax.
Maybe there's another way that we can do this.
- Will you sit down?
- No, no.
There she is.
That's her.
In the black.
That's Shannon Park.
Her team created Zydeco.
Think she kept a copy?
Yeah, and I know she has access to the embassy e-mail system.
That much I saw myself.
That's how my friend Brad got killed.
She thought he was onto her.
No, I'm telling you...
She's a murderer and a traitor.
And you can see how she takes our form.
But I swear, she's an alien.
Let's stick to Earth problems.
We need to look at Shannon's files.
If she has an unauthorized copy of Zydeco, we can get her busted.
No, y-you can't get into her system.
It's Fort Knox.
No, l-l-I tried to get in remotely and I couldn't do it.
We hit her office.
We bury a keystroke tracking program.
Come back the next day for her password.
We get the e-mails and the code.
No, no.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh, but she's...
No, look, these are very advanced beings.
She'd be able to tell if you were on her computer.
L-I think she's a little out of your league.
Okay, Mr. Computer.
Is she out of your league?
We need you to get us access at Stone Kittredge, Spencer.
Jeremy Dresner, consulting in I.T.
There should be a visitor badge in the system for me.
In medieval Europe... spies used to pose as lepers and plague victims... so they could snoop around without being bothered.
In today's corporate office, posing as I. T. Works the same way.
It's the perfect cover if you need to linger without being bothered.
And it gives you a pretext for talking to almost anyone.
Miss Park.
Jeremy Dresner, I.T., Alexandria office.
I need to speak with you.
- Great.
Make an appointment.
- No problem.
How about now?
Excuse me?
We're doing an internal audit of security procedures.
I have the paperwork right here.
We were told your whole department... would be cooperative, Ms. Park.
Well, that's funny, Jeremy.
'Cause I'm the head of this department... and nobody's said word one to me.
Well, here I am, and we're way past word one now.
Security is our business on this wing.
Your business is installing software upgrades.
So I suggest you have somebody up on 14 give me a call about this...
- and I suggest they send somebody else next time.
- Oh, I bet they will.
I bet they'll send you up to see me, Shannon.
I'm looking forward to it.
Can I borrow your bathroom key?
You're my hero.
All you need to beat a modern tumbler lock... is a little information and some Stone Age tools.
If you know the basic type of key you need to spoof, pick out a matching blank... file down the valleys to the center ledge... and you have a bump key.
Apply torque, whack it with anything handy, and you're in.
Not quite as much fun as kicking a door down.
You ready to go?
To dinner?
It's 4:30.
I told you, no more early-bird specials.
Yeah, I thought we would stop by the airport first...
- pay a visit to that front business Barry found.
- More spy hunting?
Michael, why must everything you do revolve around getting your old job back?
- Fiona, really.
This is important.
- Oh, Michael, come on.
I'll do it alone.
We're gonna have to do this eventually.
Yeah.
Just not right now.
Drug cartels aren't the only organizations... who use import-export businesses as fronts.
Intelligence agencies like them because... they make it possible for missions to finance themselves.
Who parked that gray truck out there?
Where's your boss?
They send out guns and supplies and get back goods to sell.
Native antiquities are favorites... because their subjective prices make money laundering easy.
You the manager?
No, Mr. Westen.
I'm Diego Garza.
I'm the spy you're looking for.
You're really not supposed to tell people you're a spy.
What's the point in subterfuge?
All the memos they send from D.C., they say you're very, very good.
I have to assume you're here because you want back in.
Trying to reach out?
I like you, Diego.
You're doing all the work for me.
I don't want this to hurt your feelings... but I'd really like you to get the hell out of here.
Not everything they told you about me is true.
Well, the part about me being really, really good, but...
I just want to talk to your bosses so we can clear this up.
I wish it was that simple.
I have 20 years at the Company.
I've seen villages burned.
I've seen children orphaned.
I've been shot twice.
Then they transferred me here.
Now, you know what the hardest part of this job is?
That forklift turns funny.
Now, if I report back that I made contact with a burned spy... do you know where they'll send me?
Me neither.
And I'm not rocking this boat.
I'm giving you a chance to be a friend.
Mr. Westen, I don't like threats.
But I love your sunglasses.
You have a good one, okay?
Doing a job in broad daylight... means easier access but more witnesses.
You can walk right in with your unwanted audience... but you better have a plan to entertain them.
Well, all right, ladies and gentlemen.
If I can borrow your attention, I promise to return it in about an hour.
My name is Charles Finley.
You can call me Charles.
I know.
I'm the dreaded teamwork consultant that popped up on your calendar there.
So, come on, everybody.
Follow me into the conference room right now.
Let's go.
-
- There's gonna be ice cream cake.
It's my birthday.
Let's go.
Come on.
Did I mention ice cream cake?
Come on, folks.
Come on.
Break free from your cubicle, huh?
That's the ticket.
Whoa, ho!
They warned me about you, Ms. Park.
- I don't have time for this.
- Oh, now, come on, boss lady.
Let's be a good example for everybody, huh?
What do you say?
Hey, folks.
Let's do this thing.
Have they all been taken?
Yeah, to the conference room.
Next chapter is entitled "Talk to Me:
Enhancing Your Empowerment Sphere."
Let's make this quick.
- Has anyone here heard of the Seventh Sigma?
This is the newest commandment in the business bible, people.
Anyone?
- Todd.
- "Thou shalt not lie about ice cream cake"?
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, Todd.
You're a joker, Todd.
You're gonna stay after class.
See, that's all...
Do you see that?
That encryption is Zydeco.
Those are all...
She shouldn't have those.
Those are all coded e-mails she's stealing.
Yeah, I was right.
Okay, Spencer.
I can't send a page of numbers to the F.B.I. I need the code.
- Oh, I don't like this.
- Does she have it or not?
No, I don't see it.
Look though.
Look at this.
She wiped all her bank records within 24 hours of accessing the system.
Here.
Here again.
Every time she...
Spencer...
Spencer, I need you to focus.
There's no point in her intercepting the e-mails if she can't decrypt them.
No, no...
Listen.
Every time there's a payment...
Yesterday, today... twice.
Oh, she sent two more names out.
Oh, I don't know where it's gonna happen next.
I don't know who's gonna die.
Two more, but...
Spencer, it's gonna be fine if you find the code.
Right now.
No, I told you.
It's not here.
She's too careful.
She must borrow the copy they keep in the SCI F room and put it back when she's done.
- Oh, God.
I should have seen it.
- Wait.
Now you're telling me that her copy of the code is in a SCI F room?
- That's a vault.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- The pattern...
I didn't see it.
I didn't see any of this.
- Get out of the chair!
Which brings us to the Finley Method...
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Are you leaving us?
- I have work to do.
- Folks, be right back.
Turn to page seven.
Hey, hey.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey.
Shannon...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey...
- I'm sending myself a copy of everything encrypted.
- Let's go.
- Let's hit the reset button.
Do it together.
Hit the button.
Let's reset the clock here.
No, no...
We have to take the machines.
No, we have to take the machines.
- We have to find the names.
She could have buried it.
- Spencer!
No, we have to warn the Guardians.
No, we have to.
The darkness will come.
The darkness will come.
You'll see...
You'll look up.
The stars will go out.
And every night... every night...
We can be positive, Shannon.
This is all about us...
- Team.
I. We.
- That's enough.
Shannon, you're killing me here.
Oh, come on.
Enough.
Come on, Spencer.
Come on.
They're all gonna die.
We don't have the code.
They're all gonna die.
I could...
I'll try to hack into Shannon's computer again remotely.
Yeah, if I leave the line open, maybe I can catch her when she uses the code.
You can't.
If you get caught, she can trace where you live and...
She sent more names.
We don't know who or where, but we know they're gonna die.
And those files you stole from her computer are useless without a copy of Zydeco.
- Well, that's not true.
We can use...
- There's no point in trying.
No, there's no use in even a... in even a...
even attempting to break that code.
You understand?
The whole life of the universe.
- Listen.
Please...
- I know you're trying to help, but if you think... you can break into the SCIF room to steal that code...
No, I'm sorry.
That's never gonna happen.
- You see, there's a nine-digit keypad and...
- I'm not going to...
Shannon and her friends from Procyon "A" won't just sit back and watch.
Spencer, Michael isn't going to decrypt... the e-mails that Shannon stole.
He's going to use them as a prop to scare her.
No, I don't see that.
We're gonna convince her that someone's hunting for the leak.
She'll stop selling names, cover her tracks.
We'll tip the F.B.I. When she goes to erase the SCIF room's access code.
She'll be arrested.
No more spies die.
There's justice for your friend.
The alien goes to jail.
Oh, well, that sounds good.
Is that what you were gonna say?
If you wanna keep your job, keep walking and keep your voice down.
- And act casual.
- We don't have a Jeremy Dresner in Virginia.
I checked.
Who are you and...
The people we both work for don't know my name, and neither will you.
I'm the guy cleaning up your mess.
That's all you get.
What mess?
Two days ago, you were an I.T. Guy.
Two days ago, I was shaking the tree.
There's a leak coming from Tech.
That's your department.
We're staring down the barrel of a federal case and a massive P.R. Disaster.
Zydeco's compromised.
Three American operatives are already dead.
This is ridiculous.
I don't know who you are.
- I'm calling my boss.
- Go ahead.
Use mine... if you'd rather deal with a massive federal investigation.
Shannon, the feds are just sniffing at this now.
We got two days.
After that, your stock options won't be worth the paper they're printed on.
This doesn't make any sense.
That embassy system is airtight.
Zydeco was my project.
Believe me, honey, I know it was.
Where did you get that?
I need you to call upstairs, cancel all your appointments for the day.
There's something I need you to see.
Two weeks ago, I get a call from one of our employers.
One of your programmers in your department got himself blown up.
Brad Wilkins?
They asked me to have a look.
- Cops said that was an accident.
- Yeah.
Miami-Dade detectives make 56 grand a year.
How much do you think I make?
They didn't even know about this boat.
Your boy Brad had it registered under his mother's name.
- He was careful... just not careful enough.
- Where'd he get those?
That's what we're trying to find out.
Try to keep up, honey.
Notes in the margins.
Now, I learned about the leak because Brad found out about the leak.
He was hunting them.
Why he didn't share this news, I don't know.
- But he sure did get himself killed.
- What do the notes say?
He wanted to look at the SCI F access logs.
- Now I do.
- That's eyes only.
I'm not gonna show you that.
You absolutely will.
Tomorrow is Saturday.
There'll be nobody in the office.
You will meet me here at 10:00 so I know you're clean, then we go have a show-and-tell.
Cell phones are basically wireless computers.
- What is this?
- Upload the right program... and you've got a roving bug you can turn on remotely.
You will keep that on you.
If you need to talk to me before tomorrow morning... you will use that, not the office, not the home phone.
Last person who looked into this leak was killed.
You never know who's listening.
- What if we're not the only ones in the office?
- Tomorrow morning.
No excuses.
You be here.
We don't know who's listening.
- Guess we're up and running.
- 10 by 10.
Hey, how'd Virgil's boat work out?
Did I ever tell you about the marlin we caught off of Pigeon Key?
Yeah, a few times.
Hey, do you mind keeping an ear on Shannon tonight?
I gotta head down to the airport, see if I can't motivate our pal Diego.
Front companies generally make easy targets for burglary.
They don't want people wondering what they have to hide... so they tend not to install a lot of lights, alarms and security cameras.
And, of course, they'd never invite the police in to investigate... so there's really no need to be shy about leaving clues.
But you got to admit, it's elegant.
We catch Shannon wiping the access log tonight, and she goes to jail.
It's not the crime, it's the cover-up.
I understand the plan.
I just don't like it.
I wish we could forget about this "Catch her in the act, call the feds" nonsense... and drive to her house right now and finish this properly.
I should be home in bed right now.
Hey, hey, don't be dozing' off out there.
Freakin' amateur hour around here.
- Yeah...
Hold on.
Yeah, it's Shannon.
Find it?
10437 Crest, right?
Sure you wanna do this?
I don't know.
You wanna get the needle?
I told you...
There's heat on me at work.
An I.P. Address at that location tried to hack me... some nut from the office.
I am not taking chances.
We gotta tie this up cleanly.
You cannot be around...
I put a timer underneath the house.
Same as Brad.
Goes off at midnight.
I'll be long gone by then.
Good.
Then get off the phone.
Fi, did you hear that?
Spencer stuck his neck out, and she caught him.
Yeah.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to Spencer's.
I'm gonna have to leave the front door open here.
- What if she comes to wipe the access log?
- No.
Screw it.
He's all the way on the other side of town.
I can't get there.
You gotta go.
- Hey, Sam.
Do you need some bowls?
Mike, you gotta get to Spencer's house.
Shannon set a bomb.
- It's under the house.
- It's gonna take me 25 minutes.
Well, Fi said 20.
I got my money on you, Mikey.
Get your ass in gear.
- Oh, no!
- Spencer!
No, you can't be here!
- Night is when they come!
- There's not time...
Fi, we've got a minute.
Come on.
You can't talk to him when he gets like that.
- If you're here...
- We missed her.
She's gonna erase everything.
- Did you see the news?
Nobody was home.
I should have triggered the bomb in person.
Don't.
Do not second-guess me.
I took care of the thing at work.
We should be clear.
I'll call you.
- On the phone.
Messages from Procyon "A" don't usually...
No, they come on beams of light.
This must be a special occasion.
You know?
Desperate times.
- You tried to hack her files from your house, didn't you?
- Oh, yeah.
We were in such a rush before.
I thought if I took one more shot...
- Were they talking about killing me?
- We're gonna be all right.
Oh, no.
No.
No, no.
No, there's no way to catch her.
You heard her.
She wiped the evidence.
We're going to have to convince her to give us some new evidence.
Now that you're the only one she has reason to be afraid of... you're going to have to help.
Oh, no.
Oh, what are...
How?
Well, for starters, you're gonna have to be able to string two sentences together.
You're gonna have to talk to Shannon face to face.
You gotta be kidding me.
No, no, she's one of their leaders.
- Even the Guardians fear her.
- Spencer, this is really important.
You must stick to the script.
You cannot mention aliens, light beams or any of it.
Shannon can't find out we know what she is.
She can't find out that her cover's blown.
She'll call in for backup...
all the other beings.
Okay, that makes sense.
There is no leak.
I checked the SCI F access log.
There's nothing.
I think we need to consider the possibility that Brad...
There is a leak, but we got bigger problems.
Somebody else found out.
I got a call this morning from a Spencer Watkowski.
You've seen him.
He waters plants at the office.
He's ex-N.S.A. He's a real heavy hitter.
That's impossible.
The guy...
He's a nut.
He's way off.
Yeah, nice cover, don't you think?
He wants to meet.
But what I can't figure out is why he wants you there with me.
Breathe, Spencer.
I said no surprises.
Why'd you bring a bodyguard?
Because she's the one who's selling names of American spies.
And she killed my friend Brad Wilkins, and she tried to kill me.
- You're the leak?
- It's not true.
It is true.
She's a murderer and a traitor.
Now, if you want this to be kept quiet, then I'm gonna need five million in cash.
- You don't have a shred of proof.
- Oh, yeah.
I know everything.
I know your whole dark plan.
And I know that you're one of them.
Ms. Park is one of those people who doesn't cover her tracks as well as they think.
Yesterday her password was "goldleaf1510. '"
Have you changed it yet, Shannon?
Oh, yeah.
You should see her computer.
She's got Zydeco-encrypted e-mails that look like this.
And when she decodes them, they look like that.
It's a fake.
He doesn't have the code.
He's bluffing.
Jesus, this is pathetic.
If you want to stay for this charade, you can.
I'm leaving.
I'm bluffing?
Then how do I know that you're setting up a deal... to sell another name to the Venezuelans?
Five million.
I'll bring the cash here at 10:00.
You bring a copy of everything you have.
Fine, but don't try and bring any backup.
- And don't bring any of your friends from Procyon.
- It'll just be me and the money.
Venezuela?
How did you...
Oh, the patterns.
Sometimes when you study them long enough...
Also, I saw a file labeled "Caracas" when I tried to hack her... but I couldn't get in, so...
I can't believe you're this stupid.
- You put a hit out on him?
Who else knows?
- A thug.
He's nobody.
I found him in a biker bar.
He knows nothing.
You're gonna give me his name and address.
I'm cleaning this up.
Why did you agree to pay them?
Why not just kill them too?
You really think I'm gonna pay them?
No, we're going back to the office.
You're gonna give me a copy of Zydeco.
I'm gonna pin that on their bodies along with some embassy e-mails...
- I don't understand.
What do you think...
- Are you really this slow?
It has to look like Spencer stole the code... and the e-mails from an embassy.
If the problem is on the client side, then we're protected.
Stone Kittredge stock doesn't take a hit.
I can't get into the SCI F room on a weekend without people finding out.
Do you really think you're gonna keep your job?
Today's your last day, honey.
You gotta run... and you're never gonna stop, you understand?
- Is that Zydeco?
- Yeah.
- Where are the e-mails?
- My computer, but we have to print them out... from a printer outside the building so the feds can't trace them.
- Yeah, I may skip that part.
- What...
Hey!
What...
This isn't good-bye.
I'll say hi at your trial.
No!
Hey!
Hey!
Let's see if this works.
This is Special Agent Johnson.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
This is, um...
Never mind.
I was just calling because there's a traitor...
- locked in the SCI F room at Stone Kittredge.
- What did you say?
Yeah, and there's a gig of state department e-mails on Shannon Park's computer... so you better get down here.
And you really should bring some backup.
That bitch is an alien.
Maybe he got abducted.
Hey!
Uh, sorry I'm late.
Thanks for meeting me.
I don't really trust the phone, so...
I wanted to be sure you saw the thing in the paper.
Shannon's copping a plea.
We saw it.
She's going to testify against the guy who killed Brad.
You ask me, something's wrong with the world when we don't hang traitors anymore.
- Doesn't seem right.
- Mmm.
You look good, Spencer.
Oh, really?
Well, I feel a little foggy, but...
The meds aren't great, but they come with the job, so... so it's worth it.
I hooked him up with a crypto gig.
Buddy of mine has a tech firm.
- How you likin' it, Spence?
- Oh, it's great.
It's great.
In fact, uh...
Oh, look.
I'm late.
- I should probably go.
- You know, I'll walk with you.
I have to make a stop myself.
And, you guys, thank you.
Thank you for, uh... for listening to me.
You probably shouldn't have listened to anything I said, but I'm glad you did.
Spencer?
- You got him a job.
- I actually am kind of a sweetheart.
So there's one more thing I wanted to tell you about all the aliens.
- Uh, Spencer, I thought that you were...
- Oh...
Oh, no, no.
L-I know they're not real.
I just wanted to explain.
Well, in the beginning, the first messages...
This light in the window, this-this beautiful equation...
I should have just said something.
Yeah, I should have just told people.
But it was... it was all secret.
And in code.
And I didn't have anyone I could trust.
And you're lucky.
You're just lucky to have people like that.
Yeah.
Well, if there's ever anything I can do...
Yeah.
Hey.
I had some bowls like that once.
That is crazy.
I got this in an online auction.
Had to beat out some nasty Russians who were overbidding on everything.
I knew you liked Colombian art, so I thought... what better way to say I still want us to be friends?
Yes.
My bosses noticed your auction screen name.
"Michael Hearts Diego"?
You heard about that?
I'm embarrassed.
Nice choice you gave me.
Cop to the fact that I made contact with you, or admit to skimming... and accepting bribes from enemies of the state.
- Did you choose "A"?
- You're getting what you want.
I've been assigned to be your point of contact here in Miami.
You see?
Now you don't have to leave town.
No one has to lose.
It's a win-win.
Well, I get to win twice.
A new perk of my job is that I get to tell you this...
The Company is not interested in your services at this time.
Really?
- Maybe you should show 'em this.
- They know.
Did you really think that would get you back in?
The boys upstairs don't want to pin a medal on anyone for that mess.
They want to sweep it under the rug.
Get to know me, Diego.
I'm not one of the bad guys.
Michael.
They did say they'd review your file.
I wouldn't hold my breath, but who knows?
##
##
Hi.
Hi.
So, tell me...
How did it go?
To be honest, I'm not sure.
They're gonna need some more convincing.
Even then, I don't know.
Whatever happens... one of us will be happy, I guess.
Why can't you be with me on this?
Talking to you is like talking to Spencer.
You're both so focused on one thing, it clouds everything else.
It's a crazy way to live, Michael.
You know what?
I am like Spencer.
We both see the world a certain way, and we both have skills to make it a better place.
That's not a bad thing.
I don't want to keep ducking this, so let me be straight with you.
This job, what we just did...
saving American lives... this is the type of work I was made for, Fi.
It's what my old job gave me a chance to do every single day.
So, no, getting back in isn't just a way to survive or to protect the people I love.
It's what I want.
And if you truly care about me, you should damn well want for me what I want for myself.
If that's what you want...
I'll be with you.
I'll be with you.

My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until-
- We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
When you're burned, you've got nothing- no cash, no credit, nojob history.
- You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend-
- Should we shoot them?
An old friend who used to inform on you to the F.B.I. -
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.
- Family too-
- Hey, is that your mom again?
- if you're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.
Bottom line:
As long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
Nobody wants to hear from a burned spy.
Your old handlers send your calls straight to voice mail.
Your appeals are filed in the trash.
Your old contacts are worthless.
Your best bet is to find an active field operative who can't hang up on you.
If you're on domestic soil, the airport's not a bad place to look.
Intelligence agencies are like amateur magicians.
Watch closely, and you can see how they set up their tricks.
It doesn't matter how good they are at misdirection and sleight ofhand.
They can't make a covert ops supply plane disappear.
Four-U-M-Y-three-one-four.
Oh, Mikey.
You just wrecked the most amazing dream.
All these beautiful nachos were coming right- 4
- U-M-Y-3-1-4.
Runway 3.
No flight plan, no problem?
Yep, and it's not a drug plane.
Had clearance from the tower.
It's got to be a black flight.
Bringing toys to all the good little spooks in Latin America.
Mike, please tell me this means I can go back to sleep alone in my own bed.
Is that how you celebrate these days, Sam?
Say it ain't so.
Fi.
Wow, you look-
Like I'm ready for lunch at the Delano.
I thought after a week of you eating fast food in the car with Sam... that you might like to take me.
I can't today.
I found a spy plane.
I got the tail number.
Why do you use that shot for fake I.D.'s?
It's like a bad prom picture.
I need to get some records from the F.A.A.
You need a driver's lic-
I think it makes me look trustworthy.
But I need to find out who owns the plane, who flies it, who registered it.
One of those people might be able to pull some strings, get me back in.
- And you have to find them immediately?
- Well, there's-
There's no time like the present.
It's time for Duane Winger to make his move.
Great.
I'm going to lunch.
Have fun getting your job back.
I know you don't like what I'm doing.
But you know it's not just about the job.
- You know that, right?
- Right.
It's about patriotism and duty.
And the sacred call of... whatever.
I was told that hell on earth would rain down on me without an umbrella.
I don't know, Duane.
Looks pretty sunny out there to me.
I'm gonna enjoy it.
Prom picture?
Here we go, Mr. Winger.
The plane you're asking about is owned by Executransport, Ltd.
Want to write it down?
You can borrow my pen.
How about you pull the whole file?
- Could I borrow that?
- Oh, you're bad.
We can't sign files out.
Everything back here is "look but don't touch. "
That is a shame.
I'm gonna level with you.
I'm a P.I. Workin' a messy divorce.
Sleazebag hubby's hidin' a jet under a shell company.
One little copy sure would help.
Inspector Foster to Hangar 5.
It'd be our little secret, Miss-
Linda.
Will Duane Winger please report to Reception?
Duane Winger to Reception, please.
The guy just wanted a file.
What's the big deal?
The big deal is I just got a call from the deputy director.
That file was red flagged.
When you get cornered, there's a rush of adrenaline... as the fight-or-flight response kicks in.
In those moments, you can't listen to your body.
There are some circumstances when flightjust isn't the right option.
Fortunately, with a little training and the right kind ofhitch knot... all that adrenaline can make you capable of something pretty close to flight.
Doesn't help the landing though.
Barry wanted a thousand dollars just to look into the company that owned that plane?
Yeah.
Sorry, man.
He said to get the articles of incorporation... he's got to go up to the capital.
What, is he taking a cab to Tallahassee?
Barry?
No.
His mom is up there, so he's gotta see her.
The grand is like an annoyance tax.
Fair enough.
It'll be money well spent, Mikey.
You track down the spooks that are flying that plane... get 'em to call in a few favors, you might not be stuck in Miami that much longer.
And you won't have to buy me drinks after range practice.
Subtle, Sam.
That's me, Mike.
See the olive?
Not that I'm complaining, but where's Fi?
It's not like her to skip our little ritual...
- use any chance to pop off a few rounds.
- She wasn't too thrilled-
Hey, you!
Hey, you!
You in the sunglasses!
Hey, can I see that gun?
- Careful there.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I promise I won't hurt you.
- Oh, that's good.
- It's you.
I knew you existed.
- Who are you?
My name is Spencer.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I had to make sure it was you.
He's the guy, right?
He's some kind of special ops guy.
There are times in any spy's career when someone...
- somehow figures out who you are.
- I really need your help.
Usually the best approach is tojust put on a good poker face and deny everything.
- I think you have the wrong idea.
- No.
No, no, no, no.
L
- I've been
- I've been monitoring the paper- certain items in the blotter- and crime rates, police band chatter.
- And it all adds up.
It becomes very clear.
- Not yet it doesn't.
No, the pattern-There's a pattern.
Y
- You don't just have, oh, oh, hello... a series of controlled explosions here and a dip in violent crime there.
You have to ask yourself, " What is the connection?
Who is the connection?"
So I think to myself, "We're not talking about Spider-Man. "
We're talking about a real guy who has to practice.
So I did a Fermi estimate, and I got 63% odds that he lives... within a five-mile radius of this gun range, so-
Once you see a pattern, you can't unsee it.
So you've been staking out the shooting range looking for-
You.
And your gun.
And your skills.
And-And that thing that you did with the- where you-
All that seems to confirm to me that you are the guy.
No, no.
You have to help me.
You're the guy.
What can I say?
I'm not the guy.
That's a lie.
You lied.
Very convincingly, as any trained operative would.
Listen.
You have to help me.
I don't want to make you, but I will if I have to.
Okay.
He's an operative!
This guy!
Very famous.
He's a rogue agent- special operatives guy.
Okay, okay, fine.
We're gonna talk.
Boy, are we gonna talk.
He's the spy.
So who are you?
Uh, no offense, Spencer, but who are you?
Oh, I'm a mathematician.
M.I.T.
- Did my doctoral work at Duke.
- You were saying you need help?
About a year ago I started to work at Stone Kittredge.
They do a lot of government contracts- construction, energy, tech.
Yeah, it's a defense firm.
We know 'em.
Well, I've seen some things there that I shouldn't have.
One of their vice presidents is a-well, a killer.
Okay, is this just some kind of a joke?
She's killed three already.
It's gonna happen again soon.
In Malaysia, if I had to guess.
Malaysia?
I'm not sure what's going on here, but do you have proof of something?
Not exactly, but how do you explain this?
I used my friend Brad's workstation to do some digging around in the system.
Two days later, the gas line at Brad's house blew up, and he was burned to death.
They thought he was onto them, so they killed my friend.
Calm down.
Let's back it up, Spencer.
Why were you using Brad's computer?
L
- I don't have a computer at the office.
I'm-
I take care of the plants at Stone Kittredge.
- Ah.
There it is.
- I am too busy for a full-time job, okay?
Do you have any idea how many messages I have to decode every day?
Hundreds.
Do you think beings that advanced sleep?
I'm sorry. "Beings"?
Oh, oh.
Would you like me to say "aliens"?
The bad ones are from a nearby star system
- Procyon "A."
They-They take our form.
They encode their messages in beams of light.
Gorgeous mathematics wrapped around deadly messages.
But the Guardians- they are from a planet that orbits around Ross 154.
And-And they are being hunted.
Three of them are dead already.
- Every minute that we waste-
- Okay.
All right.
Just calm down a little bit here.
No, damn it!
There is no time!
Spencer, calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Uh, there's something I need right over here.
Sit down.
Sorry.
He started talking about aliens-
Uh, crazy stuff.
He thought I was a spy.
You know, likeJames Bond or something.
- And you guys sure you don't wanna file a report?
- Oh, no, no, no.
We just didn't want to see the guy hurt himself or anybody else.
Those are the magic words every time this guy goes to court.
- Oh, so he's been in before?
- Oh, yeah.
Dispatch told us that Mr. Watkowski here... has been in and out of the psych ward for the past four years.
Big-time schizo.
Sad stuff, but, guys, thanks.
Appreciate your help, all right?
- Take care.
- Well, if you're looking for a silver lining... it's nice to know that we can still call the cops, huh?
Can't believe he found me, Sam.
Don't worry, Mike.
Most people can't decode the secrets... hidden in beams of light.
I don't know about you, but I could use that drink now.
A money launderer's natural habitat... is near rich people.
What they save by avoiding taxes... they usually spend on overpriced drinks.
But meeting with them is never boring.
Jesus.
Mike.
Hi.
"Meet me at the Chadwick.
I'm poolside.
Bring cash. "
This text doesn't even have a smiley face.
What happened to my friend Barry?
Hey, you know I don't like charging you, but that was a big favor.
I go up north, I gotta stay with my mom.
She's still mad at me I dropped out of podiatry school.
Makes me nuts.
Anyway, I needed to unwind.
The view here helps... a lot.
- Barry.
- Oh.
Okay.
Executransport, Ltd.
You're probably not gonna be shocked to hear that it's a shell company... and its registrants don't even exist.
Officially speaking, nobody owns the plane you saw.
- Not shocked, no.
- But it wasn't a total dead end though.
There's a real business tied to that plane?
North Andes Distribution.
They got a hangar over at the airport.
Probably packed the cargo on the very flight you saw.
Not bad, Barry.
Hey, listen, before you go, uh, you help me out here, Mike?
Do my back?
Hey, Mike.
Look who's back.
Hey, man.
Hey.
I'm so sorry to bother you at home, especially after-
I shouldn't have done that.
The table.
Your new friend was just explaining that he hacked the D.M. V... and found your place thanks to a parking ticket, of all things.
- He's really very clever.
- So... they let you out?
Well, they may as well have.
The nurses at that place... don't even disguise the pattern of the rounds, and the locks there are child's play.
Oh, there's no hard feelings.
I know you werejust testing me.
Spencer, you can't be here.
You're right.
We shouldn't be out in the open like this.
They're probably looking for me.
- The aliens?
- The police.
I broke out of a psych ward.
Weren't you listening?
Spencer, we can't do anything for you.
I know people think my mind's not right, but I am right.
I'm right about this.
They killed my friend Brad.
Please, just let me show you what I learned.
Hey, I found you, didn't I?
He doesn't seem that crazy to me.
All right, show us.
Okay.
I was wrong.
He's totally nuts.
Sorry about the
- Oh, there's something I really need to show you in the paper.
I can't find anything in this mess.
Yeah, sometimes I lose track of things when I leave them on the ceiling.
Ha!
No, that's-
Oh, okay, we can start there.
This is the one I was telling you about.
Three killed in the past four months.
- Just like I said.
- You said aliens.
- This looks like American spies.
- Well, the forms they take vary, but-
You're saying these men were outed by an executive at Stone Kittredge?
- Yes, that's what I'm saying.
- Wait a second.
Ronald Papa?
They said this was a climbing accident.
Mike, this guy was a friend of mine.
I mean, I worked with him.
Oh, oh, good.
So you worked with one of the Guardians.
No, don't do that.
I just sent flowers to Ron's wife... last month, so don't be making up stories about real people.
Oh, I'm not.
I lost a friend too.
My friend Brad.
The one they killed to cover it up.
The one I told you about.
See, you have to-You just have to read all these.
Please, just read them all.
Spencer, these are just a bunch of newspaper articles.
Oh, no, there's a pattern.
You have to see the pattern.
It's all connected.
There's a galactic war between these- the bad ones-
The ones from Procyon "A" are hunting the Guardians.
And guys like Brad who get in the middle- they'll kill them.
And then the darkness will come.
Unless you
- It's up to you to stop them.
Spencer, I know this guy.
He's a good guy.
He's a good doctor.
I want you to meet him.
Whether you're infiltrating a cartel... or spiking a chemical weapons sale, the most dangerous people in any covert op... are the ones on your side.
If they crack, you end up in a shallow grave.
That's usually a good enough reason to avoid working with crazy people.
Mike.
Michael.
"Diplomat Found Dead in Malaysia. "
But sometimes you have no choice.
Oh, that's the one, see?
It's like I told you.
It's today's paper.
It happened just like he said it would.
Mike, if aliens equal spies-
- What's wrong?
- Spencer, I was really hoping you were just crazy.
#Yeah ##
Okay, let me get this straight.
2007, Stone Kittredge gets the contract... to provide secure communications between American embassies.
So they do the usual firewall crap, plus they come up with a code.
- Called Zydeco, yes.
- Okay, and you think somebody there... is intercepting these encrypted e-mails... and selling the names of American spies- that's your bogus theory?
What these Procyon beings are really doing is exposing the Guardians from Ross 154.
Right.
Like my buddy Ronnie.
But how do you know it's somebody inside of Stone Kittredge... and not some whack-job on the outside who just cracked the code?
- Uh, that's absurd.
- Absurd... like " aliens are sending me messages through the PennySaver" absurd?
Zydeco's unbreakable.
It's a four-kilobyte code.
4K?
Mike, I got pictures of Miss Reynolds on my phone bigger than that.
No, an algorithmic code that takes up four kilobytes of space is beyond secure.
It would take longer than the whole life of the universe to crack it.
That-That's impossible.
Th-There's no way.
You'd really-
- You'd really need the code to read those messages.
- All right, fine.
Relax.
Maybe there's another way that we can do this.
- Will you sit down?
- No, no.
There she is.
That's her.
In the black.
That's Shannon Park.
Her team created Zydeco.
Think she kept a copy?
Yeah, and I know she has access to the embassy e-mail system.
That much I saw myself.
That's how my friend Brad got killed.
She thought he was onto her.
No, I'm telling you
- She's a murderer and a traitor.
And you can see how she takes our form.
But I swear, she's an alien.
Let's stick to Earth problems.
We need to look at Shannon's files.
If she has an unauthorized copy of Zydeco, we can get her busted.
No, y-you can't get into her system.
It's Fort Knox.
No, I-I-I tried to get in remotely and I couldn't do it.
We hit her office.
We bury a keystroke tracking program.
Come back the next day for her password.
We get the e-mails and the code.
No, no.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh, but she's-
No, look, these are very advanced beings.
She'd be able to tell if you were on her computer.
L
- I think she's a little out of your league.
Okay, Mr. Computer.
Is she out of your league?
We need you to get us access at Stone Kittredge, Spencer.
Jeremy Dresner, consulting in I.T.
There should be a visitor badge in the system for me.
In medieval Europe... spies used to pose as lepers and plague victims... so they could snoop around without being bothered.
In today's corporate office, posing as I. T. Works the same way.
It's the perfect cover if you need to linger without being bothered.
And it gives you a pretext for talking to almost anyone.
Miss Park.
Jeremy Dresner, I.T., Alexandria office.
I need to speak with you.
- Great.
Make an appointment.
- No problem.
How about now?
Excuse me?
We're doing an internal audit of security procedures.
I have the paperwork right here.
We were told your whole department... would be cooperative, Ms. Park.
Well, that's funny, Jeremy.
'Cause I'm the head of this department... and nobody's said word one to me.
Well, here I am, and we're way past word one now.
Security is our business on this wing.
Your business is installing software upgrades.
So I suggest you have somebody up on 14 give me a call about this...
- and I suggest they send somebody else next time.
- Oh, I bet they will.
I bet they'll send you up to see me, Shannon.
I'm looking forward to it.
Can I borrow your bathroom key?
You're my hero.
All you need to beat a modern tumbler lock... is a little information and some Stone Age tools.
If you know the basic type ofkey you need to spoof, pick out a matching blank... file down the valleys to the center ledge... and you have a bump key.
Apply torque, whack it with anything handy, and you're in.
Not quite as much fun as kicking a door down.
You ready to go?
To dinner?
It's 4:30.
I told you, no more early-bird specials.
Yeah, I thought we would stop by the airport first...
- pay a visit to that front business Barry found.
- More spy hunting?
Michael, why must everything you do revolve around getting your old job back?
- Fiona, really.
This is important.
- Oh, Michael, come on.
I'll do it alone.
We're gonna have to do this eventually.
Yeah.
Just not right now.
Drug cartels aren't the only organizations... who use import-export businesses as fronts.
Intelligence agencies like them because... they make it possible for missions to finance themselves.
Who parked that gray truck out there?
Where's your boss?
They send out guns and supplies and get back goods to sell.
Native antiquities are favorites... because their subjective prices make money laundering easy.
You the manager?
No, Mr. Westen.
I'm Diego Garza.
I'm the spy you're looking for.
You're really not supposed to tell people you're a spy.
What's the point in subterfuge?
All the memos they send from D.C., they say you're very, very good.
I have to assume you're here because you want back in.
Trying to reach out?
I like you, Diego.
You're doing all the work for me.
I don't want this to hurt your feelings... but I'd really like you to get the hell out of here.
Not everything they told you about me is true.
Well, the part about me being really, really good, but-
I just want to talk to your bosses so we can clear this up.
I wish it was that simple.
I have 20 years at the Company.
I've seen villages burned.
I've seen children orphaned.
I've been shot twice.
Then they transferred me here.
Now, you know what the hardest part of this job is?
That forklift turns funny.
Now, if I report back that I made contact with a burned spy... do you know where they'll send me?
Me neither.
And I'm not rocking this boat.
I'm giving you a chance to be a friend.
Mr. Westen, I don't like threats.
But I love your sunglasses.
You have a good one, okay?
Doing a job in broad daylight... means easier access but more witnesses.
You can walk right in with your unwanted audience... but you better have a plan to entertain them.
Well, all right, ladies and gentlemen.
If I can borrow your attention, I promise to return it in about an hour.
My name is Charles Finley.
You can call me Charles.
I know.
I'm the dreaded teamwork consultant that popped up on your calendar there.
So, come on, everybody.
Follow me into the conference room right now.
Let's go.
- There's gonna be ice cream cake.
It's my birthday.
Let's go.
Come on.
Did I mention ice cream cake?
Come on, folks.
Come on.
Break free from your cubicle, huh?
That's the ticket.
Whoa, ho!
They warned me about you, Ms. Park.
- I don't have time for this.
- Oh, now, come on, boss lady.
Let's be a good example for everybody, huh?
What do you say?
Hey, folks.
Let's do this thing.
Have they all been taken?
Yeah, to the conference room.
Next chapter is entitled " Talk to Me:
Enhancing Your Empowerment Sphere. "
Let's make this quick.
Has anyone here heard of the Seventh Sigma?
This is the newest commandment in the business bible, people.
Anyone?
- Todd.
- "Thou shalt not lie about ice cream cake"?
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, Todd.
You're a joker, Todd.
You're gonna stay after class.
See, that's all
- Do you see that?
That encryption is Zydeco.
Those are all-She shouldn't have those.
Those are all coded e-mails she's stealing.
Yeah, I was right.
Okay, Spencer.
I can't send a page of numbers to the F.B.I. I need the code.
- Oh, I don't like this.
- Does she have it or not?
No, I don't see it.
Look though.
Look at this.
She wiped all her bank records within 24 hours of accessing the system.
Here.
Here again.
Every time she-
Spencer-Spencer, I need you to focus.
There's no point in her intercepting the e-mails if she can't decrypt them.
No, no
- Listen.
Every time there's a payment-
Yesterday, today... twice.
Oh, she sent two more names out.
Oh, I don't know where it's gonna happen next.
I don't know who's gonna die.
Two more, but-
Spencer, it's gonna be fine if you find the code.
Right now.
No, I told you.
It's not here.
She's too careful.
She must borrow the copy they keep in the SCI F room and put it back when she's done.
- Oh, God.
I should have seen it.
- Wait.
Now you're telling me that her copy of the code is in a SCI F room?
- That's a vault.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- The pattern
- I didn't see it.
I didn't see any of this.
- Get out of the chair!
Which brings us to the Finley Method-
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Are you leaving us?
- I have work to do.
- Folks, be right back.
Turn to page seven.
Hey, hey.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey.
Shannon-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey-
- I'm sending myself a copy of everything encrypted.
- Let's go.
- Let's hit the reset button.
Do it together.
Hit the button.
Let's reset the clock here.
No, no-We have to take the machines.
No, we have to take the machines.
- We have to find the names.
She could have buried it.
- Spencer!
No, we have to warn the Guardians.
No, we have to.
The darkness will come.
The darkness will come.
You'll see-You'll look up.
The stars will go out.
And every night- every night-
We can be positive, Shannon.
This is all about us-
- Team.
I. We.
- That's enough.
Shannon, you're killing me here.
Oh, come on.
Enough.
Come on, Spencer.
Come on.
They're all gonna die.
We don't have the code.
They're all gonna die.
I could
- I'll try to hack into Shannon's computer again remotely.
Yeah, if I leave the line open, maybe I can catch her when she uses the code.
You can't.
If you get caught, she can trace where you live and-
She sent more names.
We don't know who or where, but we know they're gonna die.
And those files you stole from her computer are useless without a copy of Zydeco.
- Well, that's not true.
We can use-
- There's no point in trying.
No, there's no use in even a- in even a- even attempting to break that code.
You understand?
The whole life of the universe.
- Listen.
Please-
- I know you're trying to help, but if you think... you can break into the SCIF room to steal that code-
No, I'm sorry.
That's never gonna happen.
- You see, there's a nine-digit keypad and-
- I'm not going to-
Shannon and her friends from Procyon "A" won't just sit back and watch.
Spencer, Michael isn't going to decrypt... the e-mails that Shannon stole.
He's going to use them as a prop to scare her.
No, I don't see that.
We're gonna convince her that someone's hunting for the leak.
She'll stop selling names, cover her tracks.
We'll tip the F.B.I. When she goes to erase the SCIF room's access code.
She'll be arrested.
No more spies die.
There's justice for your friend.
The alien goes to jail.
Oh, well, that sounds good.
Is that what you were gonna say?
If you wanna keep your job, keep walking and keep your voice down.
- And act casual.
- We don't have a Jeremy Dresner in Virginia.
I checked.
Who are you and-
The people we both work for don't know my name, and neither will you.
I'm the guy cleaning up your mess.
That's all you get.
What mess?
Two days ago, you were an I.T. Guy.
Two days ago, I was shaking the tree.
There's a leak coming from Tech.
That's your department.
We're staring down the barrel of a federal case and a massive P.R. Disaster.
Zydeco's compromised.
Three American operatives are already dead.
This is ridiculous.
I don't know who you are.
- I'm calling my boss.
- Go ahead.
Use mine... if you'd rather deal with a massive federal investigation.
Shannon, the feds are just sniffing at this now.
We got two days.
After that, your stock options won't be worth the paper they're printed on.
This doesn't make any sense.
That embassy system is airtight.
Zydeco was my project.
Believe me, honey, I know it was.
Where did you get that?
I need you to call upstairs, cancel all your appointments for the day.
There's something I need you to see.
Two weeks ago, I get a call from one of our employers.
One of your programmers in your department got himself blown up.
Brad Wilkins?
They asked me to have a look.
- Cops said that was an accident.
- Yeah.
Miami-Dade detectives make 56 grand a year.
How much do you think I make?
They didn't even know about this boat.
Your boy Brad had it registered under his mother's name.
- He was careful-just not careful enough.
- Where'd he get those?
That's what we're trying to find out.
Try to keep up, honey.
Notes in the margins.
Now, I learned about the leak because Brad found out about the leak.
He was hunting them.
Why he didn't share this news, I don't know.
- But he sure did get himself killed.
- What do the notes say?
He wanted to look at the SCI F access logs.
- Now I do.
- That's eyes only.
I'm not gonna show you that.
You absolutely will.
Tomorrow is Saturday.
There'll be nobody in the office.
You will meet me here at 10:00 so I know you're clean, then we go have a show-and-tell.
Cell phones are basically wireless computers.
- What is this?
- Upload the right program... and you've got a roving bug you can turn on remotely.
You will keep that on you.
If you need to talk to me before tomorrow morning... you will use that, not the office, not the home phone.
Last person who looked into this leak was killed.
You never know who's listening.
- What if we're not the only ones in the office?
- Tomorrow morning.
No excuses.
You be here.
We don't know who's listening.
- Guess we're up and running.
- 10 by 10.
Hey, how'd Virgil's boat work out?
Did I ever tell you about the marlin we caught off of Pigeon Key?
Yeah, a few times.
Hey, do you mind keeping an ear on Shannon tonight?
I gotta head down to the airport, see if I can't motivate our pal Diego.
Front companies generally make easy targets for burglary.
They don't want people wondering what they have to hide... so they tend not to install a lot of lights, alarms and security cameras.
And, of course, they'd never invite the police in to investigate... so there's really no need to be shy about leaving clues.
But you got to admit, it's elegant.
We catch Shannon wiping the access log tonight, and she goes tojail.
It's not the crime, it's the cover-up.
I understand the plan.
I just don't like it.
I wish we could forget about this "Catch her in the act, call the feds" nonsense... and drive to her house right now and finish this properly.
I should be home in bed right now.
Hey, hey, don't be dozing' off out there.
Freakin' amateur hour around here.
Yeah
- Hold on.
Yeah, it's Shannon.
Find it?
10437 Crest, right?
Sure you wanna do this?
I don't know.
You wanna get the needle?
I told you-There's heat on me at work.
An I.P. Address at that location tried to hack me- some nut from the office.
I am not taking chances.
We gotta tie this up cleanly.
You cannot be around-
I put a timer underneath the house.
Same as Brad.
Goes off at midnight.
I'll be long gone by then.
Good.
Then get off the phone.
Fi, did you hear that?
Spencer stuck his neck out, and she caught him.
Yeah.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to Spencer's.
I'm gonna have to leave the front door open here.
- What if she comes to wipe the access log?
- No.
Screw it.
He's all the way on the other side of town.
I can't get there.
You gotta go.
Hey, Sam.
Do you need some bowls?
Mike, you gotta get to Spencer's house.
Shannon set a bomb.
- It's under the house.
- It's gonna take me 25 minutes.
Well, Fi said 20.
I got my money on you, Mikey.
Get your ass in gear.
- Oh, no!
- Spencer!
No, you can't be here!
- Night is when they come!
- There's not time-
Fi, we've got a minute.
Come on.
You can't talk to him when he gets like that.
- If you're here-
- We missed her.
She's gonna erase everything.
Did you see the news?
Nobody was home.
I should have triggered the bomb in person.
Don't.
Do not second-guess me.
I took care of the thing at work.
We should be clear.
I'll call you.
On the phone.
Messages from Procyon "A" don't usually- No, they come on beams of light.
This must be a special occasion.
You know?
Desperate times.
- You tried to hack her files from your house, didn't you?
- Oh, yeah.
We were in such a rush before.
I thought if I took one more shot-
- Were they talking about killing me?
- We're gonna be all right.
Oh, no.
No.
No, no.
No, there's no way to catch her.
You heard her.
She wiped the evidence.
We're going to have to convince her to give us some new evidence.
Now that you're the only one she has reason to be afraid of... you're going to have to help.
Oh, no.
Oh, what are
- How?
Well, for starters, you're gonna have to be able to string two sentences together.
You're gonna have to talk to Shannon face to face.
You gotta be kidding me.
No, no, she's one of their leaders.
- Even the Guardians fear her.
- Spencer, this is really important.
You must stick to the script.
You cannot mention aliens, light beams or any of it.
Shannon can't find out we know what she is.
She can't find out that her cover's blown.
She'll call in for backup- all the other beings.
Okay, that makes sense.
There is no leak.
I checked the SCI F access log.
There's nothing.
I think we need to consider the possibility that Brad-
There is a leak, but we got bigger problems.
Somebody else found out.
I got a call this morning from a Spencer Watkowski.
You've seen him.
He waters plants at the office.
He's ex-N.S.A. He's a real heavy hitter.
That's impossible.
The guy
- He's a nut.
He's way off.
Yeah, nice cover, don't you think?
He wants to meet.
But what I can't figure out is why he wants you there with me.
Breathe, Spencer.
I said no surprises.
Why'd you bring a bodyguard?
Because she's the one who's selling names of American spies.
And she killed my friend Brad Wilkins, and she tried to kill me.
- You're the leak?
- It's not true.
It is true.
She's a murderer and a traitor.
Now, if you want this to be kept quiet, then I'm gonna need five million in cash.
- You don't have a shred of proof.
- Oh, yeah.
I know everything.
I know your whole dark plan.
And I know that you're one of them.
Ms. Park is one of those people who doesn't cover her tracks as well as they think.
Yesterday her password was "goldleaf1510. '"
Have you changed it yet, Shannon?
Oh, yeah.
You should see her computer.
She's got Zydeco-encrypted e-mails that look like this.
And when she decodes them, they look like that.
It's a fake.
He doesn't have the code.
He's bluffing.
Jesus, this is pathetic.
If you want to stay for this charade, you can.
I'm leaving.
I'm bluffing?
Then how do I know that you're setting up a deal... to sell another name to the Venezuelans?
Five million.
I'll bring the cash here at 10:00.
You bring a copy of everything you have.
Fine, but don't try and bring any backup.
- And don't bring any of your friends from Procyon.
- It'll just be me and the money.
Venezuela?
How did you-
Oh, the patterns.
Sometimes when you study them long enough-
Also, I saw a file labeled "Caracas" when I tried to hack her... but I couldn't get in, so-
I can't believe you're this stupid.
- You put a hit out on him?
Who else knows?
- A thug.
He's nobody.
I found him in a biker bar.
He knows nothing.
You're gonna give me his name and address.
I'm cleaning this up.
Why did you agree to pay them?
Why not just kill them too?
You really think I'm gonna pay them?
No, we're going back to the office.
You're gonna give me a copy of Zydeco.
I'm gonna pin that on their bodies along with some embassy e-mails-
- I don't understand.
What do you think-
- Are you really this slow?
It has to look like Spencer stole the code... and the e-mails from an embassy.
If the problem is on the client side, then we're protected.
Stone Kittredge stock doesn't take a hit.
I can't get into the SCI F room on a weekend without people finding out.
Do you really think you're gonna keep your job?
Today's your last day, honey.
You gotta run... and you're never gonna stop, you understand?
- Is that Zydeco?
- Yeah.
- Where are the e-mails?
- My computer, but we have to print them out... from a printer outside the building so the feds can't trace them.
- Yeah, I may skip that part.
- What-
Hey!
What-
This isn't good-bye.
I'll say hi at your trial.
No!
Hey!
Hey!
Let's see if this works.
This is Special AgentJohnson.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
This is, um-
Never mind.
I was just calling because there's a traitor...
- locked in the SCI F room at Stone Kittredge.
- What did you say?
Yeah, and there's a gig of state department e- mails on Shannon Park's computer... so you better get down here.
And you really should bring some backup.
That bitch is an alien.
Maybe he got abducted.
Hey!
Uh, sorry I'm late.
Thanks for meeting me.
I don't really trust the phone, so-
I wanted to be sure you saw the thing in the paper.
Shannon's copping a plea.
We saw it.
She's going to testify against the guy who killed Brad.
You ask me, something's wrong with the world when we don't hang traitors anymore.
- Doesn't seem right.
- Mmm.
You look good, Spencer.
Oh, really?
Well, I feel a little foggy, but-
The meds aren't great, but they come with the job, so- so it's worth it.
I hooked him up with a crypto gig.
Buddy of mine has a tech firm.
- How you likin' it, Spence?
- Oh, it's great.
It's great.
In fact, uh
- Oh, look.
I'm late.
- I should probably go.
- You know, I'll walk with you.
I have to make a stop myself.
And, you guys, thank you.
Thank you for, uh- for listening to me.
You probably shouldn't have listened to anything I said, but I'm glad you did.
Spencer?
- You got him a job.
- I actually am kind of a sweetheart.
So there's one more thing I wanted to tell you about all the aliens.
- Uh, Spencer, I thought that you were-
- Oh
- Oh, no, no.
L
- I know they're not real.
I just wanted to explain.
Well, in the beginning, the first messages-
This light in the window, this-this beautiful equation-
I should have just said something.
Yeah, I should have just told people.
But it was- it was all secret.
And in code.
And I didn't have anyone I could trust.
And you're lucky.
You're just lucky to have people like that.
Yeah.
Well, if there's ever anything I can do-
Yeah.
Hey.
I had some bowls like that once.
That is crazy.
I got this in an online auction.
Had to beat out some nasty Russians who were overbidding on everything.
I knew you liked Colombian art, so I thought... what better way to say I still want us to be friends?
Yes.
My bosses noticed your auction screen name.
"Michael Hearts Diego"?
You heard about that?
I'm embarrassed.
Nice choice you gave me.
Cop to the fact that I made contact with you, or admit to skimming... and accepting bribes from enemies of the state.
- Did you choose "A"?
- You're getting what you want.
I've been assigned to be your point of contact here in Miami.
You see?
Now you don't have to leave town.
No one has to lose.
It's a win-win.
Well, I get to win twice.
A new perk of myjob is that I get to tell you this-
The Company is not interested in your services at this time.
Really?
- Maybe you should show 'em this.
- They know.
Did you really think that would get you back in?
The boys upstairs don't want to pin a medal on anyone for that mess.
They want to sweep it under the rug.
Get to know me, Diego.
I'm not one of the bad guys.
Michael.
They did say they'd review your file.
I wouldn't hold my breath, but who knows?
Hi.
Hi.
So, tell me
- How did it go?
To be honest, I'm not sure.
They're gonna need some more convincing.
Even then, I don't know.
Whatever happens... one of us will be happy, I guess.
Why can't you be with me on this?
Talking to you is like talking to Spencer.
You're both so focused on one thing, it clouds everything else.
It's a crazy way to live, Michael.
You know what?
I am like Spencer.
We both see the world a certain way, and we both have skills to make it a better place.
That's not a bad thing.
I don't want to keep ducking this, so let me be straight with you.
This job, what we just did- saving American lives- this is the type of work I was made for, Fi.
It's what my old job gave me a chance to do every single day.
So, no, getting back in isn't just a way to survive or to protect the people I love.
It's what I want.
And if you truly care about me, you should damn well want for me what I want for myself.
If that's what you want...
I'll be with you.
I'll be with you.

(PLAYING HARMONICA)
(SINGS SINGLE NOTE)
Ted, what are you doing?
- Band practice.
- What band?
Peons assemble!
They have to stay within earshot, it's in the band code.
Wow, Ted, it's kind of like you're their leader.
Peons disperse!
Peons assemble!
Enough of the horseplay!
(PANTING)
Now we need to practice, and I can't have you winded.
Now we've only got one shot to convince Dr. Cox to let us sing for the sick kids in Pediatrics.
One, two... (HARMONIZING)
(SINGING) All our times have come
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Oh, boy, good luck with that.
J.D.:
As wrong as it was to serenade sick kids with a song about the upside of death, it was perfect for my walk to Dr. Cox's office.
Yep, it was terrifying going up against the new Chief.
Perry, for the last time, we need more negative pressure rooms in the infectious disease ward.
TED'S BAND:
You will die
- Huh.
I didn't hear you knock.
- The door was open.
Then go outside, close the door, and knock.
- No, you're just gonna lock it.
- No, I won't.
- You know I've been burned before.
- Believe in me.
- New chapter?
- New chapter.
New chapter!
(PHONE RINGING)
- Perry Cox.
- J.D.:
We still need those rooms.
- And you, sir, are a liar.
- There is no money in the budget.
And while you're delivering bad news, please tell Ted that he can't sing in Pediatrics.
A cappella music is, how to put this delicately?
Ear rape.
(HARMONIZING)
- Guys, guys, guys!
He said no.
- Oh, man!
Well maybe, he'll let us sing for the people in the burn ward.
No, I asked.
He said they're already in enough pain.
Besides, Teddy, hospital already has someone who sings to the kids.
Who?
(SINGING) One day the moon got tired of being up in the sky
He wandered down through the starlight
And landed on the ocean side And he smiled while...
That's a cute song.
It's not cute...
It's beautiful.
His swim trunks and snorkel And guess what?
Mr. Moon swam
J.D., good news, Cox just added two new negative pressure rooms.
Great job wearing him down.
J.D.:
But still, with Dr. Cox, winning has ramifications.
Janice, you are one ugly baby.
Seriously.
Did you actually teach your son to be mean to a baby?
Not just any baby, but your baby.
Come here, Jackie Boy!
We're going to get 10,000 jellybeans.
I love you so much.
They can both be so hurtful.
MAN: (SINGING) I can't do this all on my own
No, I know
I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman
You got to pick Jack up from preschool today.
Why can't you do it?
Hello, I'll be busy taking care of our daughter.
Jennifer is with the nanny.
Okay, fine.
Jack's school gets out at 2:00, and you know I take a nap every day from 11:30 to 3:00.
- Are you enjoying your life?
- Yeah, it's pretty nice.
And yours?
- It's different.
- Huh.
- Got your latte, champ.
- Well now, thank you.
Boy, oh boy, you're really digging the heck out of this whole secret-friendship thing, aren't you?
Well, it has all the thrill of an affair, without all that exhausting sex.
Do you realize that I have to do rounds, see patients, pick up my son Jack, and somehow put a dent in all this bureaucratic ridiculousness?
You're the Chief of Medicine, you can't keep doing all the things you used to do.
You have to let something go.
Just don't drop the ball with your son.
That's what I did with Harrison.
He and his new life partner, Caleb, have just opened a boutique on Fire Island called "Everything Mesh."
- You like mesh, Perry?
- No, Bob, I don't.
Well, I didn't either at first.
But the boxers really breathe.
I can do it all.
Craig, I thought I told you I never wanted to see you in here again.
- I'm sick.
- I am now officially on the case.
Can I talk to you in the hall for one second?
Sure.
Look, I know you and Craig have a history, but I'm sure you're swamped.
I don't mind taking this one.
No, no, Craig was my patient before, so he'll be my patient now.
Plus, if you don't treat him, then he gets to go home not smelling like cocoa butter.
Mock away, but do you think it's an accident that I have the complexion of a 12-year-old Greek boy?
Don't get me wrong,
I still want you to be a big part of Craig's treatment team.
Say, Craig?
Is there anything you want Dr. Puberty Beard to go get for ya?
- A root beer, please.
- Nice to have you on board.
Whoa.
You took the last two root beers.
- Give me one.
- No.
This one is for a patient, and this one...
It's for me.
The old lick-the-can-so- no-one-will-want-it trick.
Too bad I beat you to it.
"Licked by Janitor."
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)
(CHUCKLES) You'll find the same note on your cell phone.
Have you ever seen such an angel?
Okay, Teddy.
It's time to throw down your power rap.
Wow, look at Ted go!
- Can I help you?
- No, you cannot!
Yeah.
Every time Ted chickens out with a girl, he goes straight to his bike and pedals home.
Cherish the pain, Ted.
It means you're still alive.
I wish I could help that bald, sweaty bastard.
- Maybe you and I could team up.
- I bet you think I'm going to say no.
But let me tell you something about the Dorians.
We trust.
And we trust hard.
It's the reason why every single Dorian has a loyal army of friends.
It's also why last weekend I flew to the Ozarks for a spontaneous waterski getaway with Dr. Cox.
He was not there.
Nor was his lakeside cabin.
There had also been talk of a tire swing.
- In or out?
- In.
- For Ted.
All right.
- For Ted.
Yo, Chief, for some reason, there are three different shift schedules floating around.
If you don't put out a new one, you're going to get every nurse showing up at the same time.
I'm on it.
Okay.
Last patient.
A pre-excitation of the ventricle due to accessory pathways, a condition called what?
It's Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
Nice job.
I'm out of time, so
I'm going to go ahead and answer these last questions myself.
Now what is...
Let me finish.
What is Ebstein's Anomaly?
Great job, group.
I appreciate the effort.
Now leave.
(WHISTLES)
Not you.
You didn't raise your hand, not even once.
I wasn't feeling it.
Well, that's perfectly understandable, but for the record, what is Ebstein's Anomaly?
Yes, dark-haired guy.
Oh, I thought it was just the hand-raising part.
No.
Okay, I know I was supposed to read up on that.
But Dr. Cox, are you familiar with those electronic trivia games they have at bars?
Sure.
My buddies and I bought one at a police auction, and we've got this really intense game going.
And they're going to call me whenever my team's turn comes up.
Wow!
Your laziness has finally caught up with you.
But no worries.
As your teacher, I'm going to make sure you get through all this, because...
For the next two days, you're going to sit your ass in that chair, and you are going to learn everything there is to know about the human heart.
I'm going to come around every once in a while and ask you questions, and if you don't know the answer, I'm going to take that textbook, and I'm going to drive it through your skull.
How does that sound?
- Pretty frightening.
- Good luck.
Look, Ted.
You're obviously upset about the ukulele girl.
So, we've called a truce to help you out.
I'm not upset.
Ted, we found you in the park, throwing rocks at old couples.
Why should they be happy?
Come on, man!
You can get this girl.
No, no, no, you don't understand!
If I even think about a girl that hot, I get the most unbelievable dry mouth.
I mean, just picturing her beautiful eyes and her cute... (GASPING)
(WHEEZING)
What is that?
It's gum and tonic.
Gin, rum and tonic.
Don't get him drunk.
He can barely talk as it is.
You don't get drunk on gum.
It's a breakfast liqueur.
And you know what?
I don't like you telling me what to do.
Truce off.
Truce on.
That was a patient's lab results.
And you can't just turn the truce off whenever you want to.
- Sure you can.
- Fine, truce off.
No.
Truce on!
Truce on!
Truce on!
It's my latte.
And it's scalding hot.
(EXCLAIMS) Yeah, it is.
JANITOR:
Ted, do you want to get this girl?
Give her a present.
Better yet, a present that you made.
My first date with Lady, I made her a duck I killed.
Now, you're thinking, "Wouldn't it have been more romantic
"to kill it in front of her?"
And yes, it would have.
And that was my plan.
But in the car, on the way over, we kind of got into it, you know.
Maybe I was in a bad mood, maybe he was, I don't know.
But one thing led to another, and then we're off on the side of the road, shirtless and seeing what's what.
Next thing I knew...
I'm really not comfortable murdering for her.
It's fine.
The important thing is to be confident.
When you talk to her, you think about something, anything, that puts you at a confident place.
The important thing is to be honest.
Just tell her how you really feel.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Yep, those are gum legs.
All right, Craig.
Your CAT scan showed enlarged lymph nodes, so we gotta do a biopsy, which means we're going to make a little cut under your arm, and take a tiny sample.
Is it going to hurt?
A little bit, but...
It's okay, 'cause I'm going to be by your side the whole way.
- You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.
I got one thousand things I got to attend to here.
I'll check in with you later.
Dr. Cox?
- Yeah.
- I'm scared.
Why don't you tell me what's scaring you, and we'll see what I can do to make it better.
Okay, Ted.
I think we found a way to get you over your fear of talking to this girl.
Kill me?
'Cause I'd be willing to try that.
No, Ted.
Do you remember when you were a kid and your father threw you in the deep end of the pool to teach you how to swim?
Swim, Ted!
Hey.
(WHEEZING)
(ELEVATOR DINGING)
- Is our friend in there?
- He's in the corner.
You just spooked him a little bit.
But if we're quiet, he'll come out on his own.
Hey, guys.
Did you have something you wanted to talk to me about?
J.D.:
And then Ted remembered what the Janitor had said about confidence.
And he knew that there was only one situation where he actually had it.
Peons assemble!
I heard you playing yesterday and thought you might like to jam with us.
- I'm Teddy Buckland, by the way.
- I'm Stephanie Gooch.
Well, Gooch.
See if you can keep up.
(SINGING) Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
J.D.:
As I watched Ted, I realized that a little confidence is a good thing.
But as I saw Dr. Cox rush by, it occurred to me that too much can get you into trouble.
Because if you go around plugging leaks all day...
Brian, the machine is broken.
There's no way there was a president named Garfield.
Study, or get a book to the face.
J.D.:
You're bound to miss one.
Hey, if you're wondering, this is what it looks like when all the nurses show up at once.
I'll deal with it in a second.
J.D.:
And before you know it, the floodgates open.
Where the hell is Craig?
Seventeen nurses took him down for his biopsy at 2:00.
It's past two already?
J.D.:
And something big falls through the cracks.
I will pick up Jack after preschool today.
- My massage is right by there.
- I'm doing it.
End of story.
Go away!
You're not my doctor anymore.
Puberty Beard is.
You know, Craig, I was kind of hoping that nickname wouldn't stick.
Craig, I'm sorry.
I just got a little held up out there.
I know it's not the thickest beard.
It's not like, you know, Santa Claus.
- You broke the promise.
- Well, have it your way.
Just real quick back to the beard.
Do you want to touch it?
I really don't.
There is the stud muffin.
How'd it go with Gooch?
We jammed all night.
The two of us even sang one of her songs, which made me think
I might have a chance with her.
(SINGING) I've got too many questions in my mind
I've got too many answers to find
Can I give up all I've imagined
Am I magical enough for this to happen
- Because I like you
- I like you
- I like you
- I like you
And like can lead to like-like And like-like can lead to love
Sure as the stars above
- I'd really like to kiss you
- I'd really like to screw you
- Oh.
- Oh.
When we're singing, and the band's around, everything's fine.
But as soon as we're alone, I literally can't breathe.
Ted, you're never going to get closer to this woman until you dig down deep and find the courage to tell her how you really feel.
Yeah.
- What do you got?
- For the rest of your life, 100% of your communication with this woman should be in song.
Loving it!
So how is your day going today, any better?
I'm okay.
Oh, give it up.
Everybody knows you two are friends.
Oh, please, Carla.
I still hate Bob-o with a...
We're like brothers.
- I'm done hiding this, Perry.
- COX:
My head hurts.
Well, you wouldn't be so stressed out if you let people help you.
- Let me do the nurses' schedule.
- No.
You don't understand, Carla.
He has to control everything.
Good, you're here.
I'm surprised he doesn't try to control the words I say.
I can control the words you say.
Say something annoying.
- I just think...
- COX:
Ta-da!
Look, I've said this before.
You cannot be Chief of Medicine without giving something up.
I mean, why on Earth is he still teaching interns?
Because he loves teaching.
He needs to give up some of those patients.
What he needs to do is give up some of the bureaucratic stuff.
Would you all be quiet for one second?
Hey, Dorian.
Perry and I are like brothers now.
Bob, he's not going to take that well.
I do everything for you and you still won't let me in?
You know what, thank you, Perry.
Thank you for giving me my life back.
Because I am done.
- J.D., he needs our help.
- I'm back in.
I'm here for you, buddy.
I don't need your help, I am in control of everything.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Daddy, you weren't here to pick me up.
So I got scared and tried to find you.
- Jack?
- Daddy?
(EXCLAIMS)
- JORDAN:
Hey, Perry.
- I'm alive!
You know, last weekend, Perry and I went to the movies together.
So?
Thought you'd be interested.
- Was it a romantic comedy?
- Yeah.
(SCREAMING)
Maybe they're all right.
I have to give something up.
Sweetie, I've got to talk to your dad for a second.
- Go over there and staple some stuff.
- Cool!
Perry, they don't know you like I do.
You're not capable of giving up on anything that you care about.
Whether it's a patient or your never-ending quest to please me sexually.
I'm going to blow you away tonight.
I'm sure it'll be amazing.
My point is, is that eventually you'll balance things out.
Who cares if you can't pick Jack up from preschool?
Just make sure that you're home in time for his bedtime stories.
Thank you.
Hey guys!
I finally got a brother!
Kid's either a genius or an idiot.
Hey, Ted, would you like to get a cup of coffee some time?
- Peons!
- STEPHANIE:
Wait.
I was just thinking that maybe it could be the two of us.
I thought maybe we could get to know each other.
(GASPS)
Oh.
You know, I'm an idiot.
I've been dropping all these subtle hints that I like you.
Sideways glances, the secret smiles, telling you I want to screw you.
You're clearly not interested.
Gooch!
I'm really not what you would call a winner.
Oh sure, I'm a lawyer, but that's only because I took the bar exam in Alaska, and they only have like four laws, and most of them are about when you can and cannot kill seals.
And if it seems like I'm uninterested, it's only because I have no idea why you would like me.
I mean, you are the most beautiful, perfect ukulele player I've ever seen.
I know that's not saying much, because they're usually fat Hawaiians.
Still, I think what I'm trying to say is,
Stephanie, I would love to go and have coffee with you.
Well, what time do you get off of work?
Who cares?
I guess you were right about the whole honesty thing.
Well, he never would have gotten to that point if you hadn't told him to be confident.
- We're a good team.
- Yeah.
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)
Why is your hand wet?
(J.D. READING)
(LAUGHS)
- I guess the truce is off.
- I like to think it was never really on.
(SINGING) Oh, Johnny wishes he was famous
Spends his time alone In the basement
With Lennon and Cobain
- I told you to leave me alone.
- Yeah, you did.
But I can't do that, Craig.
I screwed up, I broke a promise to you.
But I'm sorry.
And I'm standing here asking you to forgive me.
And I'm not leaving until you do.
- Make him go away.
- I can't, buddy.
I have a lot of patients to see.
You're stuck with him.
J.D.:
As I watched Dr. Cox, I realized he was going to do it all.
Even if it meant compromising a little.
Like letting a close friend cross the T's and dot the I's.
Here's a first pass of the nurses' schedule.
Please feel free to make any changes you want and put it out.
No problem.
J.D.:
Or deciding not to bother teaching someone who doesn't want to be taught.
Time's up.
You patient has a sodium channel abnormality in the cardiac tissue that puts him at risk of sudden death.
What does he have?
Actually, I didn't get to that chapter yet.
There was this trivia thing.
Did you know
- James Garfield was our...
- It's been two days.
You're fired.
J.D.:
Still, it's all worth it if you get home in time to read stories to your son.
It's okay.
You'll try again tomorrow.
Come on.
We are
We are all innocent
Aren't we gonna, you know, have intercourse?
I would, but this isn't my fantasy.
It's that guy's.
He doesn't want to imagine me doing that with anyone.
Oh.
Oh, what the hell.
Let's get freaky.
Oh, Ted.
No, no!
What is that?
Is that your butt?
It is?
Ted, what are you doing?
- Band practice.
- What band?
Peons assemble!
They have to stay within earshot, it's in the band code.
Wow, Ted, it's kind of like you're their leader.
Peons disperse!
Peons assemble!
Enough of the horseplay!
Now we need to practice, and I can't have you winded.

Ear rape.
- Guys, guys, guys!
He said no.
- Oh, man!

No, I asked.
He said they're already in enough pain.

Mock away, but do you think it's an accident that I have the complexion of a 12-year-old Greek boy?
Don't get me wrong,
I still want you to be a big part of Craig's treatment team.
Say, Craig?
Is there anything you want Dr. Puberty Beard to go get for ya?
- A root beer, please.
- Nice to have you on board.
Whoa.
You took the last two root beers.
- Give me one.
- No.
This one is for a patient, and this one...
It's for me.
The old lick-the-can-so- no-one-will-want-it trick.
Too bad I beat you to it.
"Licked by Janitor."
You'll find the same note on your cell phone.
Have you ever seen such an angel?
Okay, Teddy.
It's time to throw down your power rap.
Wow, look at Ted go!
- Can I help you?
- No, you cannot!
Yeah.
Every time Ted chickens out with a girl, he goes straight to his bike and pedals home.
Cherish the pain, Ted.
It means you're still alive.
I wish I could help that bald, sweaty bastard.
- Maybe you and I could team up.
- I bet you think I'm going to say no.
But let me tell you something about the Dorians.
We trust.
And we trust hard.
It's the reason why every single Dorian has a loyal army of friends.
It's also why last weekend I flew to the Ozarks for a spontaneous waterski getaway with Dr. Cox.
He was not there.
Nor was his lakeside cabin.
There had also been talk of a tire swing.
- In or out?
- In.
- For Ted.
All right.
- For Ted.
Yo, Chief, for some reason, there are three different shift schedules floating around.
If you don't put out a new one, you're going to get every nurse showing up at the same time.
I'm on it.
Okay.
Last patient.
A pre-excitation of the ventricle due to accessory pathways, a condition called what?
It's Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
Nice job.
I'm out of time, so
I'm going to go ahead and answer these last questions myself.
Now what is...
Let me finish.
What is Ebstein's Anomaly?
Great job, group.
I appreciate the effort.
Now leave.
Not you.
You didn't raise your hand, not even once.
I wasn't feeling it.
Well, that's perfectly understandable, but for the record, what is Ebstein's Anomaly?
Yes, dark-haired guy.
Oh, I thought it was just the hand-raising part.
No.
Okay, I know I was supposed to read up on that.
But Dr. Cox, are you familiar with those electronic trivia games they have at bars?
Sure.
My buddies and I bought one at a police auction, and we've got this really intense game going.
And they're going to call me whenever my team's turn comes up.
Wow!
Your laziness has finally caught up with you.
But no worries.
As your teacher, I'm going to make sure you get through all this, because...
For the next two days, you're going to sit your ass in that chair, and you are going to learn everything there is to know about the human heart.
I'm going to come around every once in a while and ask you questions, and if you don't know the answer, I'm going to take that textbook, and I'm going to drive it through your skull.
How does that sound?
- Pretty frightening.
- Good luck.
Look, Ted.
You're obviously upset about the ukulele girl.
So, we've called a truce to help you out.
I'm not upset.
Ted, we found you in the park, throwing rocks at old couples.
Why should they be happy?
Come on, man!
You can get this girl.
No, no, no, you don't understand!
If I even think about a girl that hot, I get the most unbelievable dry mouth.
I mean, just picturing her beautiful eyes and her cute...
What is that?
It's gum and tonic.
Gin, rum and tonic.
Don't get him drunk.
He can barely talk as it is.
You don't get drunk on gum.
It's a breakfast liqueur.
And you know what?
I don't like you telling me what to do.
Truce off.
Truce on.
That was a patient's lab results.
And you can't just turn the truce off whenever you want to.
- Sure you can.
- Fine, truce off.
No.
Truce on!
Truce on!
Truce on!
It's my latte.
And it's scalding hot.
Yeah, it is.
Ted, do you want to get this girl?
Give her a present.
Better yet, a present that you made.
My first date with Lady, I made her a duck I killed.
Now, you're thinking, "Wouldn't it have been more romantic
"to kill it in front of her?"
And yes, it would have.
And that was my plan.
But in the car, on the way over, we kind of got into it, you know.
Maybe I was in a bad mood, maybe he was, I don't know.
But one thing led to another, and then we're off on the side of the road, shirtless and seeing what's what.
Next thing I knew...
I'm really not comfortable murdering for her.
It's fine.
The important thing is to be confident.
When you talk to her, you think about something, anything, that puts you at a confident place.
The important thing is to be honest.
Just tell her how you really feel.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Yep, those are gum legs.
All right, Craig.
Your CAT scan showed enlarged lymph nodes, so we gotta do a biopsy, which means we're going to make a little cut under your arm, and take a tiny sample.
Is it going to hurt?
A little bit, but...
It's okay, 'cause I'm going to be by your side the whole way.
- You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.
I got one thousand things I got to attend to here.
I'll check in with you later.
Dr. Cox?
- Yeah.
- I'm scared.
Why don't you tell me what's scaring you, and we'll see what I can do to make it better.
Okay, Ted.
I think we found a way to get you over your fear of talking to this girl.
Kill me?
'Cause I'd be willing to try that.
No, Ted.
Do you remember when you were a kid and your father threw you in the deep end of the pool to teach you how to swim?
Swim, Ted!
Hey.
- Is our friend in there?
- He's in the corner.
You just spooked him a little bit.
But if we're quiet, he'll come out on his own.
Hey, guys.
Did you have something you wanted to talk to me about?
J.D.:
And then Ted remembered what the Janitor had said about confidence.
And he knew that there was only one situation where he actually had it.
Peons assemble!
I heard you playing yesterday and thought you might like to jam with us.
- I'm Teddy Buckland, by the way.
- I'm Stephanie Gooch.
Well, Gooch.
See if you can keep up.
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
J.D.:
As I watched Ted, I realized that a little confidence is a good thing.
But as I saw Dr. Cox rush by, it occurred to me that too much can get you into trouble.
Because if you go around plugging leaks all day...
Brian, the machine is broken.
There's no way there was a president named Garfield.
Study, or get a book to the face.
J.D.:
You're bound to miss one.
Hey, if you're wondering, this is what it looks like when all the nurses show up at once.
I'll deal with it in a second.
J.D.:
And before you know it, the floodgates open.
Where the hell is Craig?
Seventeen nurses took him down for his biopsy at 2:00.
It's past two already?
J.D.:
And something big falls through the cracks.
I will pick up Jack after preschool today.
- My massage is right by there.
- I'm doing it.
End of story.
Go away!
You're not my doctor anymore.
Puberty Beard is.
You know, Craig, I was kind of hoping that nickname wouldn't stick.
Craig, I'm sorry.
I just got a little held up out there.
I know it's not the thickest beard.
It's not like, you know, Santa Claus.
- You broke the promise.
- Well, have it your way.
Just real quick back to the beard.
Do you want to touch it?
I really don't.
There is the stud muffin.
How'd it go with Gooch?
We jammed all night.
The two of us even sang one of her songs, which made me think
I might have a chance with her.
I've got too many questions in my mind
I've got too many answers to find
Can I give up all I've imagined
Am I magical enough for this to happen
- Because I like you
- I like you
- I like you
- I like you
And like can lead to like-like And like-like can lead to love
Sure as the stars above
- I'd really like to kiss you
- I'd really like to screw you
- Oh.
- Oh.
When we're singing, and the band's around, everything's fine.
But as soon as we're alone, I literally can't breathe.
Ted, you're never going to get closer to this woman until you dig down deep and find the courage to tell her how you really feel.
Yeah.
- What do you got?
- For the rest of your life, 100% of your communication with this woman should be in song.
Loving it!
So how is your day going today, any better?
I'm okay.
Oh, give it up.
Everybody knows you two are friends.
Oh, please, Carla.
I still hate Bob-o with a...
We're like brothers.
- I'm done hiding this, Perry.
- My head hurts.
Well, you wouldn't be so stressed out if you let people help you.
- Let me do the nurses' schedule.
- No.
You don't understand, Carla.
He has to control everything.
Good, you're here.
I'm surprised he doesn't try to control the words I say.
I can control the words you say.
Say something annoying.
- I just think...
- Ta-da!
Look, I've said this before.
You cannot be Chief of Medicine without giving something up.
I mean, why on Earth is he still teaching interns?
Because he loves teaching.
He needs to give up some of those patients.
What he needs to do is give up some of the bureaucratic stuff.
Would you all be quiet for one second?
Hey, Dorian.
Perry and I are like brothers now.
Bob, he's not going to take that well.
I do everything for you and you still won't let me in?
You know what, thank you, Perry.
Thank you for giving me my life back.
Because I am done.
- J.D., he needs our help.
- I'm back in.
I'm here for you, buddy.
I don't need your help, I am in control of everything.
Hello?
Daddy, you weren't here to pick me up.
So I got scared and tried to find you.
- Jack?
- Daddy?
- Hey, Perry.
- I'm alive!
You know, last weekend, Perry and I went to the movies together.
So?
Thought you'd be interested.
- Was it a romantic comedy?
- Yeah.
Maybe they're all right.
I have to give something up.
Sweetie, I've got to talk to your dad for a second.
- Go over there and staple some stuff.
- Cool!
Perry, they don't know you like I do.
You're not capable of giving up on anything that you care about.
Whether it's a patient or your never-ending quest to please me sexually.
I'm going to blow you away tonight.
I'm sure it'll be amazing.
My point is, is that eventually you'll balance things out.
Who cares if you can't pick Jack up from preschool?
Just make sure that you're home in time for his bedtime stories.
Thank you.
Hey guys!
I finally got a brother!
Kid's either a genius or an idiot.
Hey, Ted, would you like to get a cup of coffee some time?
- Peons!
- Wait.
I was just thinking that maybe it could be the two of us.
I thought maybe we could get to know each other.
Oh.
You know, I'm an idiot.
I've been dropping all these subtle hints that I like you.
Sideways glances, the secret smiles, telling you I want to screw you.
You're clearly not interested.
Gooch!
I'm really not what you would call a winner.
Oh sure, I'm a lawyer, but that's only because I took the bar exam in Alaska, and they only have like four laws, and most of them are about when you can and cannot kill seals.
And if it seems like I'm uninterested, it's only because I have no idea why you would like me.
I mean, you are the most beautiful, perfect ukulele player I've ever seen.
I know that's not saying much, because they're usually fat Hawaiians.
Still, I think what I'm trying to say is,
Stephanie, I would love to go and have coffee with you.
Well, what time do you get off of work?
Who cares?
I guess you were right about the whole honesty thing.
Well, he never would have gotten to that point if you hadn't told him to be confident.
- We're a good team.
- Yeah.
Why is your hand wet?
- I guess the truce is off.
- I like to think it was never really on.
Oh, Johnny wishes he was famous
Spends his time alone In the basement
With Lennon and Cobain
- I told you to leave me alone.
- Yeah, you did.
But I can't do that, Craig.
I screwed up, I broke a promise to you.
But I'm sorry.
And I'm standing here asking you to forgive me.
And I'm not leaving until you do.
- Make him go away.
- I can't, buddy.
I have a lot of patients to see.
You're stuck with him.
J.D.:
As I watched Dr. Cox, I realized he was going to do it all.
Even if it meant compromising a little.
Like letting a close friend cross the T's and dot the I's.
Here's a first pass of the nurses' schedule.
Please feel free to make any changes you want and put it out.
No problem.
J.D.:
Or deciding not to bother teaching someone who doesn't want to be taught.
Time's up.
You patient has a sodium channel abnormality in the cardiac tissue that puts him at risk of sudden death.
What does he have?
Actually, I didn't get to that chapter yet.
There was this trivia thing.
Did you know
- James Garfield was our...
- It's been two days.
You're fired.
J.D.:
Still, it's all worth it if you get home in time to read stories to your son.
It's okay.
You'll try again tomorrow.
Come on.
We are
We are all innocent
Aren't we gonna, you know, have intercourse?
I would, but this isn't my fantasy.
It's that guy's.
He doesn't want to imagine me doing that with anyone.
Oh.
Oh, what the hell.
Let's get freaky.
Oh, Ted.
No, no!
What is that?
Is that your butt?
It is?
Ted, what are you doing?
Band practice.
What band?
Peons assemble!
They have to stay within earshot, it's in the band code.
Wow, Ted, it's kind of like you're their leader.
Peons disperse!
Peons assemble!
Enough of the horse play!
Now we need to practice, and I can't have you winded.
Now we've only got one shot to convince Dr. Cox to let us sing for the sick kids in pediatrics.
One, two.
[Blue Oyster Cult
- Don't Fear The Reaper]
# All our times have come,
# Seasons don't fear the Reaper,
Oh boy, good luck with that.
As wrong as it was to serenade sick kids with a song about the upside of death, it was perfect for my walk to Dr. Cox's office.
Yep, it was terrifying going up against the new chief.
Perry, for the last time, we need more negative pressure rooms in the infectious diseases ward.
Huh, I didn't hear you knock.
The door was open.
Then go outside, close the door, and knock.
No, you're just going to lock it.
No, I won't.
You know I've been burned before.
Believe in me.
- New chapter?
- New chapter.
New chapter!
Perry Cox.
We still need those rooms.
And you sir, are a liar.
There is no money in the budget.
And while you're delivering bad news, please tell Ted that he can't sing in pediatrics.
A cappella music is, how to put this delicately... ear rape.
Guys, guys, guys!
He said no.
Oh man!
Well maybe, he'll let us sing for the people in the burn ward.
No, I asked.
He said they're already in enough pain.
Besides, Teddy, hospital already has someone who sings to the kids.
Who?
# One day # The moon got tired of being
# Up in the sky
# He wandered # Down through the starlight
# And landed on the ocean side # And he smiled while...
That's a cute song.
It's not cute.
It's beautiful.
# His swim trunks and snorkel # And guess what
# Mr. Moon swam
Good news, Cox just added two new negative pressure rooms.
Great job wearing him down.
But still, with Dr. Cox, winning has ramifications.
Janice, you have one ugly baby.
Seriously.
Did you actually teach your son to be mean to a baby?
Not just any baby, but your baby.
Come here, Jackie Boy!
We're going to get 10,000 jelly beans.
I love you so much.
They can both be so hurtful.
Season 8 Episode 8
My Lawyer's In Love
You got to pick Jack up from preschool today.
Why can't you do it?
Hello, I'll be busy taking care of our daughter.
Jennifer is with the nanny.
Okay, fine.
Jack's school gets out at 2:00 and you know I take a nap everyday from 11:30 to 3:00.
Are you enjoying your life?
Yeah, it's pretty nice.
And yours?
It's different.
Got your latte, champ.
Well now, thank you.
Boy oh boy, you're really digging the heck out of this whole secret friendship thing, aren't you?
Well, it has all the thrill of an affair, without all that exhausting sex.
Do you realize that I have to do rounds, see patients, pick up my son Jack, and somehow put a dent in all this bureaucratic ridiculousness?
You're the Chief of Medicine, you can't keep doing all the things you used to do.
You have to let something go.
Just don't drop the ball with your son.
That's what I did with Harrison.
He and his new life partner Caleb have just opened a boutique on Fire Island called "Everything Mesh".
You like mesh Perry?
No, Bob, I don't.
Well, I didn't either at first.
But the boxers really breathe.
I can do it all.
Craig,
I thought I told you I never wanted to see you in here again.
I'm sick.
I am now officially on the case.
Can I talk to you in the hall for one second?
Sure.
Look, I know you and Craig have a history, but I'm sure you're swamped.
I don't mind taking this one.
No no, Craig was my patient before, so he'll be my patient now.
Plus, if you don't treat him, then he gets to get home not smelling like cocoa butter.
Mock away, but do you think it's an accident that I have the complexion of a 12-year-old Greek boy?
Don't get me wrong, I still want you to be a big part of Craig's treatment team.
Say hum, Craig?
Is there anything you want Dr. Puberty Beard to go get for you?
A root beer, please.
Nice to have you on board.
You took the last two root beers.
- Give me one.
- No.
This one is for a patient, and this one... is for me.
The old "Lick the can, so no one will want it" trick.
Too bad I beat you to it.
Licked by Janitor.
You'll find the same note on your cell phone.
Have you ever seen such an angel?
Okay Teddy.
It's time to throw down your power rap.
Wow, look at Ted go!
Can I help you?
No you cannot!
Yeah.
Every time Ted chickens out with a girl, he goes straight to his bike and pedals home.
Cherish the pain, Ted.

- My head hurt.
Well, you wouldn't be so stressed out if you let people help you.
Let me do the nurses schedule.
No.
You don't understand, Carla.
He has to control everything.
Good, you're here.
I'm surprised he doesn't try to control the words I say.
I can control the words you say.
Say something annoying.
- I just--
- Ta-dah!
Look, I've said this before.
You cannot be Chief of Medicine without giving something up.
I mean, why on earth is he still teaching interns?
Because he loves teaching.
He needs to give up some of those patients.
What he needs to do is give up some of the bureaucratic stuff.
Would you all be quiet for one second?
Hey Dorian.
Perry and I are like brothers now.
Bob, he's not going to take that well.
I do everything for you and you still won't let me in?
You now what, thank you, Perry.
Thank you for giving me my life back.
Because I am done.
- JD, he needs our help.
- I'm back in.
I'm here for you buddy.
I don't need your help, I am in control of everything.
Hello?
Daddy, you weren't here to pick me up.
So I got scared and tried to find you.
- Jack?
- Daddy?
Hey, Perr'.
I'm alive!
You know.
Last weekend, Perry and I went to the movies together.
So?
Thought you'd be interested.
- Was it a romantic comedy?
- Yeah.
Maybe they're all right.
I have to give something up.
Sweety, I got to talk to your dad for a second.
Go over there and staple some stuff.
Cool!
Perry, they don't know you like I do.
You're not capable of giving up on anything that you care about.
Whether it's a patient, or your never ending quest to please me.
I'm going to blow you away tonight.
I'm sure it'll be amazing.
My point is, is that eventually you balance things out.
Who cares if you can't pick Jack up from preschool?
Just make sure that you're home in time for his bedtime stories.
Thank you.
Hey guys!
I finally got a brother!
Kid's either a genius or an idiot.
Hey Ted, would you like to get a cup of coffee some time?
Peons!
I was just thinking that maybe, it could be the two of us.
I thought maybe we could get to know each other.
You know, I'm an idiot.
I've been dropping all these subtle hints that I like you.
Sideways glances, the secret smiles, telling you I want to screw you.
You're clearly not interested.
Gooch!
I'm really not what you would call a winner.
Oh sure, I'm a lawyer, but that's only because I took the Bar exam in Alaska, and they only have like four laws and most of them are about when you can and cannot kill... seals.
And if it seems like I'm uninterested, it's only because I've no idea why you would like me.
I mean, you are the most beautiful, perfect... ukulele player I've ever seen.
And no that's not saying much, because they're usually fat Hawaiians.
Still, I think what I'm trying to say is...
Stephanie, I would love to go and have coffee with you.
What time do you get off from work?
Who cares?
I guess you were right about the whole honesty thing.
Well, he never would have gotten to that point if you hadn't told him to be confident.
- We're a good team.
- Yeah.
Why is your hand wet?
Licked by Janitor.
I guess the truce is off.
I'd like to think it was never really on.
I told you to leave me alone.
Yeah you did.
But I can't do that Craig.
I screwed up, I broke a promise to you.
But I'm sorry.
I'm standing here asking you to forgive me.
And I'm not leaving until you do.
Make him go away.
I can't, buddy.
I have a lot of patients to see.
You're stuck with him.
As I watched Dr. Cox, I realized, he was going to do it all.
Even if it meant compromising a little.
Like letting a close friend cross the T's and dot the I's
Here is the first pass of the nurses schedule.
Please feel free to make any changes you want and put it out.
No problem.
Or deciding not to bother teaching someone who doesn't want to be taught.
Time's up.
You patient has a sodium channel abnormality in the cardiac tissue which puts him at risk of sudden death, what does he have?
Actually, I didn't get to that chapter yet.
There was this trivia thing, did you know
- James Garfield was our twenti--
- It's been two days.
You're fired.
Still, it's all worth it if you get home in time to read stories to your son.
It's okay.
You'll try again tomorrow.
Come.
Aren't we gonna, you know...
have intercourse?
I would, but this isn't my fantasy.
It's that guy's.
He doesn't want to imagine me doing that with anyone.
Oh what the hell.
Let's get free.
Oh, Ted.
No, no!
What is that?
Is that your butt?
It is?
previously on... a thief was confronted.
Well, maybe you'll feel comfortable talking to a professional.
A psychiatrist?
Someone lit me a cigar.
Carlos hired a old girlfriend... and gaby hired a spy.
I talked to carlos.
You're in!
Edie dug deeper into dave's past.
Killed three years ago-- car crash.
That was his wife.
Givee that one.
Their daughter died in the same crash.
And dave's master plan... you really think I make that much of a difference in mike's life?
If he ever lost you, it would destroy him.
Entered its final phase.
Is this the ranger station?
Well, I didn't know whether to call you or fish and game, but, uh, I think I saw some gu up at emerson ods hunting illegally, and I got worried because I know people like to go camping up there,
and I-I sure wouldn't want anyonto get hurt.
No, no need to thank me.
I'just doing my part as a concerned citizen.
Bye now.
dave williams had been planning the murder for years.
and like all the best plans, it was a simple one.
First, he would guide mike delfino and katherine mayfair to a remote cabin.
The next morning, he'd pretend to be asleep as the two lovers left to go hiking.
Dave would then grab the gun he'd carefully hidden... and start to follow his quarry.
He'd wait until the two had paused for a moment to catch their breaths.
And then he'd pull the trigger... breaking the heart of the man who had killed his wife.
When the rangers arrived, they would mention the reports of illegal hunters in the area.
And dave would drive mike back home, all the while enjoying his pain.
Yes, dave williams had come up with a very simple plan.
But as he was about to discover... have you faxed this clipping to edie williams yet?
Um, doing it right now.
There is nothing simple... about murder.
Fairview Man******
Desperate Housewives Season05 Episode18
Life is full of nasty shocks... unpleasant surprises that jolt our systems... and cause our hearts to skip a beat.
and these shocks always occur...
- susan?
- Hey, karl.
When we ast expect them.
Karl.
What are you doing here?
Well, I just enrolled evan.
And I was worried that we'd be out of each other's lives forever.
Mm, lucky, lucky.
What are you doing here?
I am an art teacher.
Really?
Do they know that?
And now I'm ignoring you and moving on to evan.
Hello, evan.
Evan, this is susan.
She's your sister julie's mother.
We used to be married.
She was a lot younger then.
Evan, why don't you head into the classroom?
I need to talk to your daddy, and I may need to use some grown-up words.
okay, susie Q. , What's wrong?
Get it off that chest you wouldn't let me enhance.
Listen, it's bad enough that I've got one ex-husband running around the halls.
I don't need the faculty and the parents knowing that I have two.
So not a word about us having been married.
No more wisecracks.
No susie q'S.
I am miss susan, art teacher.
Yes, miss susan.
Can I bang your erasers after class?
Karl, I'm serious.
Don't mess with me.
I have a yardstick, and I'm not afraid to use it.
we're gonna be making a presentation for the morrison contract sooner than we planned.
There are a lot of firms gunning for this, and--damn it, lynette!
Don't--don't touch my figurines.
These are worth more than the house you live in.
Big deal.
So is this coffee mug.
- All right, we should break for lunch.
- No.
Until this deal closes, we work through lunch.
But as a consolation, we'll also be working nights.
Nights?
You really think that's necessary?
This is a $10 million deal, carlos.
How bad do you want it?
You heard the woman.
we're working nights.
Um, I have a tiny scheduling conflict.
I coach my daughter's basketball team on friday nights.So if I could-- friday nights are now work nights.
If we're successful, those of you on commission stand to do very well.
And those of you who aren't?
Well, you get to keep your jobs, which, in this economy, is a bonus all by itself.
All right, let's run down to the deli, grab a sandwich and meet back here in five.
You.
No touching.
And, yes, I'll know.
Isn't she fun?
hey, carlos.
Did I ever tell you that tom a I seriously considered you and gaby for penny's godparents?
You're not getting friday nights off.
Look, I'm not happy about the schedule either.
I'm missing my kids, too.
Then do something about it.
You're the president.
Put the brakes on lucy.
Lynette, I hired her to crack the whip, and that's what she's doing.
It's good for the company.
but she makes people crazy.
Can't you talk to her, get her to dial it down a bit?
I will think about it.
But don't be asking me for favors like this.
When we're at the office, I'm not your neighbor, I'm not your friend.
I'm your boss.
Got it?
Oh, by the way, you and tom are coming over for cocktails on saturday.
Oh, yeah.
I plan to get drunk and bitch about my boss.
I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.
Do you at least know why he steals?
If there were some sordid childhood trauma we could blame it on, it would really help me out with the neighbors.
Oh, he knows.
Dr. Bernstein uncovered that my very first session.
Really?
And--and yet he keeps charging me.
So, doctor, what's this "revelation" that you've been keeping from me for $200 an hour?
I steal to hurt you.
Why would you want to hurt me?
Each day for the past year, you have, inch by inch, slice by slice, brought me closer to being a eunuch.
Would you excuse us for moment?
This just became a private conversation.
If I stay, I might be able to help.
You wanna help?
Why don't you go down to the pharmacy in the lobby and buy some aspirin?
I'm gonna need it.
I don't deserve this.
I have been nothing busupportive of you since you got out of jail.
I even gave you a job.
I wanted to be your partner.
You made me an employee.
So you decided to punish me by resorting to petty theft?
For god sakes, orson, I'm your wife.
Perhaps, but I'm not your husband.
We may share a bed, but you save your passion for your company.
- That's not true!
- Isn't it?
Every day for the past year, I have been in the background, an afterthought, while yospend day and night nurturing your business.
All the while thinking I had your support.
I tried.
I thought I wouldn't mind being mr.
Bree van de kamp.
But it's killing me.
Every day, I get smaller and smaller.
And if something doesn't change, orson hodge is just gonna disappear altogether.
girls are out like a light.
Thanks for dinner.
Carlos, do you have to go back to work?
Gaby, I got a meeting.
But can't lucy cover it?
You know those two extras zeroes at the end of my paycheck you like so much?
They're there because I'm president.
Hours are part of the gig.
How about a quickie?
Babe, I don't have time.
Right, that's why I didn't suggest a longie.
Oh, come on.
I'll have your eyes rolling back in your head in three minutes flat.
You wanna do it there in front of the kids' sippy cups?
all gone.
Now let's do this.
It'll be like old times.
We never did it on the table.
Yeah, we did, years ago.
Don't you remember?
I don't think that was me.
Right.
Well, we'll create new table memoes.
If you're trying to turn me on, you just failed miserably.
carlos, do you realize since bradley died and you took over, we haven't had sex once?
I miss you.
I wanna spend time with you.
Now move the creamed corn and do me!
Okay, how about tomorrow night?
Yeah, I've heard that before, and then tomorrow comes, and you're too tired.
Okay, then, this weekend.
I'll be all yours.
And we can defile any piece of furniture you want.
Hey, karen, you don't have any fax paper, do you?
fax paper!
Turn down the dean martin!
don't worry about it.
I'll go to the store tomorrow.
Do you need anything?
Eggs... milk...
lightbulbs... okay, let's make this easier.
Is there athing you don't need?
I'll tell you what.
I'll call you from the store in the morning, okay?
One*****
What a lovely rainbow, june.
Here's a gold star for you.
Oh, drew, wow!
You know, elephants don't have wings, but I like the way you're thinking.
hey, evan, what did you draw?
that's a lot of red.
It's blood.
Okay.
So... that man must be a doctor making the bloody man all better?
No, he's stabbing him in the guts with a sword.
Evan, that'S... kind of a scary picture.
Nuh-unh, it's fu no, honey, it's inappropriate, especially when the assignment was to make a picture that makes you happy.
This does make me happy.
Where's my gold star?
I just can't get used to everyone working-- first bree, then susan, now lynette.
Thank god for you.
I just had to get out of that boring house.
So what do you gals do when you get together?
Mostly gossip.
You got any good gossip?
I heard ed simmons got a harley.
You know, I should get back.
Come on.
Give me a break.
I'm still new at this.
okay.
We'll start with something a little easier--bitching.
I can handle that.
Bitch away.
Well, I am so pissed at carlos.
He is never home.
And when he is, he's too tired to do anything.
And by "anything," I mean sex.
- Are you uncomfortable?
- A little.
Go on.
Well, we've never had a drought like this.
It's been almost two weeks.
Two weeks?
And that's a drought for you?
Yeah.
Lately, carlos just doesn't want to do it.
wrong.
Guys always wanna do it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Even if you're tired and get home late?
Even if we're exhausted and late and been shot in the leg... twice.
We still want to.
So you just gotta get past the (red adult to find the horny teenage boy inside.
That's good to know.
You're good at this girl talk thing.
Well, thanks.
so, um, does lynette ever talk about me and sex?
Yeah, I should get back.
you called me down here for this?
It's a kid playing with a soccer ball.
It's a head, and he's stabbing someone with a sword.
Well, maybe it was in self-defense.
Mr. Mayer, generally, when kids exhibit this type of behavior, there's a problem.
excuse me.
I have to take this.
Sorry.
hello?
Thanks for ratting out my kid on his first day.
It's not my fault.
I showed this to the school psychologist.
She gave it to the principal.
My hands were tied.
So right away it's evan's fault?
Did you ever consider that he didn't understand the assignment?
I told the class to draw something that made them happy.
All the other kids drew kittens and rainbows.
Your son drew small intestines on the end of a stick.
Let's cut to what this is really about.
You hate me, and you don't want my son in your class.
- That is not true!
- It is, too!
You're still punishing me for what happened between us.
You're stuck in the past and blaming me for your screwed-up life!
Okay, will someone call guinness?
Because you just set the world record for the biggest load of crap in one sentence.
Oh, bite me!
How long was I gone?
this is nothing, mr.
Hobson.
We were just having a difference of opinion.
Yeah, and my opinion is your teacher doesn't understand the difference between emotional problems and creativity.
- shut up, karl.
- Excuse me.
Did you just tell him to shut up?
You know, this is typical "susan" behavior.
And you wonder why no man can stay with you.
would this seem any less shocking if I told you we were once married for 12 years?
Yes, am I speaking to mr.
Dinsmore?
Ah, this is bree van de kamp.
Yes, it's nice to talk to you, too.
Well, as I'm sure you're aware, your company has made several offers to purchase mine.
Yes, I know I said I wasn't interested, but some things have happened in my personal life and I think I'm ready to... finally make a deal.
Really?
Well, that's wonderful.
Why don't you, uh, come to my office tomorrow and we'll talk?
Good-bye, mr.
Dinsmore.
There you go.
The rest is yours.
Thanks.
I don't know what it is.
Every time I go to the market, there's stuff I forget.
I know what it is.
You're old.
- so where's dave?
- Camping.
Ooh, camping.
How fun.
Enjoying the great outdoors, getting a bunch of teenage kids on prom weekend.
Good for him.
Look, I know that you think he's some creepy psycho.
But you should know that he has had a very hard life, and there are things about him that you don't understand.
Like what?
Like he was married before, and his wife died in an accident along with their 3-year-old daughter.
Oh, edie.
Are you sure?
yes.
So if at times his behavior seems a little strange, try to remember the grief he's carrying.
You know, I lost a kid.
It does things to you.
No wonder he... oh, god, I wish I'd known.
Well, you do now.
So next time, try to be a little more understanding.
Of course.
You know, I could use a drink.
Come to my house and we'll crank up dean martin and... toss a few back. come on.
mom?
Oh, andrew.
I didn't hear you come in.
That dinsmore guy is waiting for you downstairs.
Thank you, dear.
I must say, bree.
I was surprised to get your call.
You've always said you'd never sell your company.
Bree has decided she wants more family time.
She's a very traditional woman, you know.
It's one of the reasons I fell in love with her.
Does that mean you're gog to stop working altogether?
I know your fans have been hoping for a second book, uh, my wife included.
that's sweet, but I've decided to focus on other pursuits at the moment.
Mm, yes, her sole ambition now is to be mrs.
Orson hodge.
And at the risk of sounding selfish, I'm glad I'll be the only one she's cooking for.
were you able to look over the contracts I sent over?
Oh, shoot.
I left them upstairs.
Well, I'll get them.
I'll show you the offices before we start the demolition.
You're getting rid of your office?
No, we don't need it anymore, and bree knows I've always wanted a game room.
So it's your "sole ambition" to be mrs.
Orson hodge?
Andrew.
No, I-I have to ask.
Why are you letting orson se your company?
It was my idea.
My work has been compromising my marriage.
I didn't realize the toll it's been taking on orson.
Okay, so he's unhappy.
Buy him some golf clubs, put him on lithium, but don't give up everything you've worked so hard for.
Andrew, do you know why my book sold so well?
Because it was authentic.
I actually believe in the old-fashioned values I wrote about.
I believe in men opening doors for ladies and children respecting their elders.
I also believe that sometimes women need to make sacrifices for their husbands.
I would be the worst kind of hypoite if I preached these values and then didn't follow them myself.
Okay, I get it.
You love orson, and you're willing to sell your company to prove it.
What I'm wondering is, is if he loves you, why would he want you to stop doing what makes you happy?
You busy?
What is it?
I brought you a little gift.
Cute.
I thought it would be a nice addition to your collection.
- I knew it was you.
- Pardon?
You're the one who complained about me to carlos.
I'M...not sure what you're talking about.
Oh,jeez.
What,you knife me in the back,and now you're gonna play stupid?
Carlos said some people are having problems with me and that I should watch my demeanor.
And I thought to myself,who are "some people"?
And then it hit me-- it's the chummy neighbor.
Okay,yes,carlos and i spoke briefly,but I thought he blew me off.
So that's your defense?
You thought your backstabbing was unsuccessful?
well,I'll admit it's kind of flimsy,but until I got something better... okay,next time you have an issue with me,you know where my office is.
Oh,and,uh,as far as friday nights are concerned... consider that a permanent work night.
Don't worry.
If you're as bad at coaching as you are at office politics,your daughter won't be missing much.
Found the contract.
Everything is in ord.
All we need now is your signature.
Mr. Dinsmore,would you mind if I speak to my husband for a moment?
Oh,yeah,please,go ahead.
I'll--I'll be right outside.
What's wrong?
this is happening so fast.
Yes,a bit.
But it was your idea.
Well,I have a new idea.
I'd like to wait.
Wait?
Bui-I need this for my recovery.
Just give me one year.
That's not asking too much,is it?
You made me a promise.
You need to stick to it.
Orson,think about how I built this company from nothing, how it brings me joy and pride and a sense of accomplishment.
Is that really something you want me to give up?
Yes.
Mr. Dinsmore,would you come back in,please?
So are we ready?
Actually,no.
I'm not selling.
Excuse me?
Tell your wife I will be doing that second book after all.
Well,I'm--I'm sorry to hear that.
bree...what about my problem?
I might start stealing again.
Steal what you must,my love.
But it won't be my company.
look at him.
He's out like a light already.
That's what a long day of fishing does to you.
Yeah,well,he's gonna need all of his energy for our big hike tomorrow,right?
Actually,I don't think I'm gonna go with you guys.
My knee's been kind of bothering me.
Okay,well,then why don't we wait till the next day and see how you feel?
No,no,it's fine.
I'm just gonna hang out here.
Besides,it's such a romantic hike.
You guys should do it alone.
You always have such a good attitude.
Do I?
It seems like you take everything in stride,you know?
Like you just naturally find the silver lining.
Yeah,I wish it were natural.
I had to teach myself to be this way.
With some of the stuff that's happened to me,I never would've survived if I hadn'T.
So what's your secret?
Oh,I realized that...
I was waiting for somebody to fix things.
But no one was going to.
It was all up to me.
I had to decide what was important and go after it.
I had to make myself happy.
are you?
happy.
I'm gettin' there.
Why don't you get some sleep?
You got a big day tomorrow.
come on,lucy.
Why would you agree to this meeting?
Well,we're overextendedas it is.
fine.
Yeah,I'll see you at the conference room at 7:00 A.M.
Hi there.
Hey,babe.
What are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep.
I was a little hot.
that's better.
you look a little warm yourself.
Okay,I know where you're going with this.
Oh,if that were true,your pants would be around your ankles right now.
gaby,what are you doing?
I'm releasing the horny teen inside of you.
now come on.
Two boobs,no waiting.
Damn it,gaby,I thought we were gonna wait till the weekend.
I'm tired.
not my problem.
actually,it is!
You know,if big carlos is tired,that pretty much rules out little carlos,too.
Now listen up,the pair of you.
I haven't been sitting around in butt floss all night for my health.
You're putting out.
That's more like it!
Well,I'm awake now.
In fact... mind if we spice it up a bit?
I forgot these were in the nightstand.
This is gonna be fun.
There.
How's that?
Tight,just the way I like it.
me,too.
Good night.
Carlos,where you going?
To go grab a few hours sleep before I have to get back to work.
Carlos,get back here!
Carlos!
could you at least scratch my nose?
Amy,that is very sweet.
I love the colors you used.
Oh,danielle,that is just beautiful.
Evan,that is very pretty.
You did the assignment just like I asked.
Good job!
That's not mine.
Annie asked me to bring hers up for her.
This one's mine.
fairview man won't be charged in accident that killed two
i know everything come home now,edie
I heard a gunshot.
It sounded like a hunting rifle.
Yeah,it almost hit katherine.
You guys all right?
Yeah,I think so.
Hey,this is a state park.
People aren't supposed to be hunting here.
Well,I guess these guys don't care about that.
I just wanna get out of here.
Please?
Yeah,of course.
We'll,uh,go back and pack,and we'll leave.
Well,sorry,man.
Me,too.
sorry about last night,i love you, carlos
Juanita!
Celia!
Get your coats on!
We're going to see daddy.
Let me see it.
Okay,just so you know,should be bringing this to the psychologist.
But I didn't,because this kind of "self-expression" usually gets a kid expelled.
Just let me see it.
Aw,hell.
Yeah,"aw,hell."
You got a problem here,karl.
Your son's got some serious anger issues,and you need to figure out what's going on.
I know what's going on.
This is his mom.
Marisa?
Well,why would he draw a picture of her like this?
She left us...six weeks ago.
Karl...
I woke up one day to find her standing there with her bags packed.
She said she was overwhelmed,that she loved evan but she wasn't cut out to be a mother.
So she just left?
So here I am,alone,raising this boy.
And it's obvious I'm not doing a very good job.
you must be loving this.
Why?
'Cause I did the exact same thing to you.
Yeah.
You know,I can understand why you react the way you do when you bump into me,why it bothers you.
I never really got it until just now.
I usedo hope that one day,you would know what this fe like,and now that you do...
I'm so sorry.
Hey,lynette!
Great office.
I see you're busy.
Don't let me disturb you.
I just wanted to drop off the girls so I could talk to carlos for a sec.
All right,girls,have fun with aunt lynette.
You think you can buy me off with presents?
Gaby,now is not a good time.
Well,I'd say let's talk about it tonight,but who knows if you're even gonna come home?
damn it,gaby.
You're the one that pushed me take this job.
And ever since I did,all you've done is complain about how hard I'm working.
You're right,and I'm sorry.
It's just...
I'm scared.
We're turning into what we used to be.
I'm unhappy at home,you're always working,trying to buy me off wh presents, too tired to make me feel loved.
We've made these mistakes before,carlos.
For god sakes,let's not make 'em again.
I made a commitment here,gaby.
I don't think I can just bail.
I know you can't,and that's the part that really scares me.
We're bored.
Hey,I got you sodas,didn't I?
And I let you feed the paper shredder.
Don't you have any toys?
No.
I got a hole puncher.
Sorry.
That's the best I could do.
Come on.
What about those glass things?
They're pretty.
Can I hold one?
Oh,sweetie,those aren't to play with,not unss you wanna see someone go completely bonkers.
Actually,they do look like a lot of fun.
If only I had the power to stop you... what the hell are you doing?
We're playing.
What does it look like?
are these your kids?
'Cause they were in my office playing with my figurines,which are imported.
They're worth a lot of dinero.
do you even undstand what I'm saying?
What's with the yelling?
I don't know.
I'm just as worried as you are.
Look,let me boil it down for you.
Office?
S?
Day care?
No!
Lucy,what's going on?
Apparently,some people don't understand that this is a place of business, and they need to keep their kids at home!
Then I guess you should yell at me.
These are my kids.
come here,sweetie.
I,uh,I didn't know that.
I-I thought they were hers 'cause they're... could you just go?
I'm sorry.
So what if they were?
That's the way you talk to people?
I said I'm sorry.
Look,I-I am trying so hard to make this deal happen.
I guess the stress is just getting to me.
It's getting all of us.
Maybe it's a sign we should change the way we do things around here.
We are trying to play with the big boys,carlos.
Now is not the time to pull back.
Don't you want this company to succeed?
I wanna build a company that treats its people well and lets them go home at night to see their families.
Look,I know I don't have the greatest beside manner.
But you hired me to take this company to number one.
Now if you don't want to do that,I'm probably not your girl.
I was just thinking the same thing.
What happened to you?
The old carlos would do anything to be the best.
I guess I'm not the old carlos anymore.
Fine.
don't forget your little animals!
orson,please come upstairs.
I know what that couch does to your back.
Don't worry about me.
I'll be ne.
Know you're disappointed right now, but you have to know, I really do want to find some way for you to be happy.
So do I.
hey,don't you want your stuff?
Oh,can I get it tomorrow?
I just really want to get home.
Edie?
I always wondered why you were so determined to live on wisteria lane.
You said you thought we'd be happy here,and I wanted to believe you.
But it turned out that you... just wanted to be close to mike delfino.
Who gave you that?
Nobody gave it to me.
I did research.
You think I'm too stupid to do research?
Edie,listen.
This doesn't mean anything.
It's all there--the accident,mike's acquittal,and even a little mention of how... david dash couldn't make it to the funeral because he had a nervous breakdown.
Honey,look.
Just give me a chance to explain.
Oh,so now you want to explain?
okay,why don't you start by explaining why you married me?
I married you because I love you.
No!
You married me because you needed a cover story so you could get close to the man who killed your family.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah,it's insane.
But that's why you did it.
So what are you gonna do now?
You gonna hurt him?
I mean...you know,that's the only. logical explanation.
And my only question is... what the hell have you been waiting for?
Honey,you're not feeling well.
Let's get you upstairs into bed.
Tell me the truth,you freak.
Did you move us here to hurt mike delfino?
He destroyed...everything I ever loved, and he was never punished.
I need to make things right.
why?
Why did you have to do this?
we could've been so happy.
what are you doing?
I'm gonna tell him before you... before you do something stupid.
Edie,don'T.
give me that.
no!
get out of here!
Just get the hell out!
I'm calling the police!
Do you hear me?
yes,life is full of nasty shocks.
And they always seemo occur when we least expect them.
and once our system has been jolted,the question becomes,will we survive?
to be continued
Previously on...
A thief was confronted.
Well, maybe you'll feel comfortable talking to a professional.
- A psychiatrist?
Someone light me a cigar.
- Carlos hired a old girlfriend... and Gaby hired a spy.
- I talked to Carlos.
You're in!
Edie dug deeper into Dave's past.
Killed three years ago-- car crash.
That was his wife.
Give me that one.
Their daughter died in the same crash.
And Dave's master plan...
- You really think I make that much of a difference in Mike's life?
If he ever lost you, it would destroy him.
entered its final phase.
Uh, hi.
Is this the ranger station?
Well, I didn't know whether to call you or fish and game, but, uh, I think I saw some guys up at Emerson Woods hunting illegally, and I got worried because I know people like to go camping up there,
and I-I sure wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.
Oh.
No, no need to thank me.
I'just doing my part as a concerned citizen.
Bye now.
(Mary Alice) Dave Williams had been planning the murder for years.
(door bells jingle)
And like all the best plans, it was a simple one.
First, he would guide
Mike Delfino and Katherine Mayfair to a remote cabin.
The next morning, he'd pretend to be asleep as the two lovers left to go hiking.
Dave would then grab the gun he'd carefully hidden... (click) and start to follow his quarry.
He'd wait until the two had paused for a moment to catch their breaths.
And then he'd pull the trigger... (gunshot)
breaking the heart of the man who had killed his wife.
When the rangers arrived, they would mention the reports of illegal hunters in the area.
And Dave would drive Mike back home, all the while enjoying his pain.
Yes,
Dave Williams had come up with a very simple plan.
Ugh!
But as he was about to discover...
Have you faxed this clipping to Edie Williams yet?
Um, doing it right now.
there is nothing simple... (punches buttons)
(beep) about murder.
(whirring)
Life is full of nasty shocks... (electric zap)
(gasps) unpleasant surprises that jolt our systems... (electricity pops) and cause our hearts to skip a beat.
(electricity crackles)
And these shocks always occur...
Susan?
- Hey, Karl.
when we least expect them.
Karl.
What are you doing here?
Well, I just enrolled Evan.
Wow.
And I was worried that we'd be out of each other's lives forever.
Mm, lucky, lucky.
What are you doing here?
- I am an art teacher.
Really?
Do they know that?
And now I'm ignoring you and moving on to Evan.
Hello, Evan.
Evan, this is Susan.
She's your sister Julie's mother.
We used to be married.
She was a lot younger then.
Evan, why don't you head into the classroom?
I need to talk to your daddy, and I may need to use some grown-up words. (chuckles)
Okay, Susie Q., what's wrong?
Get it off that chest you wouldn't let me enhance.
Listen, it's bad enough that I've got one ex-husband running around the halls.
I don't need the faculty and the parents knowing that I have two.
So not a word about us having been married.
No more wisecracks.
No Susie Q's.
I am Miss Susan, art teacher.
Yes, Miss Susan.
Can I bang your erasers after class?
Karl, I'm serious.
Don't mess with me.
I have a yardstick, and I'm not afraid to use it.
(chuckles)
We're gonna be making a presentation for the Morrison contract sooner than we planned.
There are a lot of firms gunning for this, and--damn it, Lynette!
Don't--don't touch my figurines.
These are worth more than the house you live in.
Big deal.
- So is this coffee mug.
All right, we should break for lunch.
No.
Until this deal closes, we work through lunch.
But as a consolation, we'll also be working nights.
Nights?
You really think that's necessary?
This is a $10 million deal, Carlos.
How bad do you want it?
You heard the woman. (sighs) We're working nights.
Um, I have a tiny scheduling conflict.
I coach my daughter's basketball team on Friday nights.
So if I could--
- Friday nights are now work nights.
If we're successful, those of you on commission stand to do very well.
And those of you who aren't?
Well, you get to keep your jobs, which, in this economy, is a bonus all by itself.
All right, let's run down to the deli, grab a sandwich and meet back here in five.
You.
No touching.
And, yes, I'll know.
Isn't she fun?
(chuckles)
Hey, Carlos.
Did I ever tell you that Tom and I seriously considered you and Gaby for Penny's godparents?
- You're not getting Friday nights off.
Look, I'm not happy about the schedule either.
I'm missing my kids, too.
- Then do something about it.
You're the President.
Put the brakes on Lucy.
Lynette, I hired her to crack the whip, and that's what she's doing.
It's good for the company.
(lowers voice) But she makes people crazy.
Can't you talk to her, get her to dial it down a bit?
I will think about it.
But don't be asking me for favors like this.
When we're at the office, I'm not your neighbor,
I'm not your friend.
I'm your boss.
Got it?
Oh, by the way, you and Tom are coming over for cocktails on Saturday.
Oh, yeah.
I plan to get drunk and bitch about my boss.
I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.
Do you at least know why he steals?
If there were some sordid childhood trauma we could blame it on, it would really help me out with the neighbors.
Oh, he knows.
Dr. Bernstein uncovered that my very first session.
Really?
And--and yet he keeps charging me.
So, doctor, what's this "revelation"
that you've been keeping from me for $200 an hour?
I steal to hurt you.
Why would you want to hurt me?
Each day for the past year, you have, inch by inch, slice by slice, brought me closer to being a eunuch.
Would you excuse us for moment?
This just became a private conversation.
If I stay, I might be able to help.
You wanna help?
Why don't you go down to the pharmacy in the lobby and buy some aspirin?
I'm gonna need it.
(exhales deeply)
(door opens and closes)
(sighs)
I don't deserve this.
I have been nothing but supportive of you since you got out of jail.
I even gave you a job.
(scoffs) I wanted to be your partner.
You made me an employee.
So you decided to punish me by resorting to petty theft?
For God sakes, Orson, I'm your wife.
Perhaps, but I'm not your husband.
We may share a bed, but you save your passion for your company.
That's not true!
- Isn't it?
Every day for the past year, I have been in the background, an afterthought,
While you spend day and night nurturing your business.
All the while thinking I had your support.
I tried.
I thought I wouldn't mind being Mr. Bree Van de Kamp.
But it's killing me.
Every day, I get smaller and smaller.
And if something doesn't change,
Orson Hodge is just gonna disappear altogether.
(sighs) Girls are out like a light.
Thanks for dinner.
Carlos, do you have to back to work?
- Gaby, I got a meeting.
But can't Lucy cover it?
You know those two extras zeroes at the end of my paycheck you like so much?
They're there because I'm President.
Hours are part of the gig.
Hey.
How about a quickie?
Babe, I don't have time.
Right, that's why I didn't suggest a longie.
Oh, come on.
I'll have your eyes rolling back in your head in three minutes flat.
You wanna do it there in front of the kids' sippy cups?
(thud)
All gone.
Now let's do this.
It'll be like old times.
We never did it on the table.
Yeah, we did, years ago.
Don't you remember?
I don't think that was me.
Oh.
Right.
Well, we'll create new table memories.
If you're trying to turn me on, you just failed miserably.
(scoffs) Carlos, do you realize since Bradley died and you took over, we haven't had sex once?
I miss you.
I wanna spend time with you.
Now move the creamed corn and do me!
- Okay, how about tomorrow night?
Yeah, I've heard that before, and then tomorrow comes, and you're too tired.
Okay, then, this weekend.
I'll be all yours.
And we can defile any piece of furniture you want.
Hey, Karen, you don't have any fax paper, do you?
(loudly) Fax paper!
Turn down the Dean Martin!
(normal voice) Don't worry about it.
I'll go to the store tomorrow.
Do you need anything?
Eggs...
Milk...
Lightbulbs... (sets down pen) Okay, let's make this easier.
Is there anything you don't need?
I'll tell you what.
I'll call you from the store in the morning, okay?
(beep)
What a lovely rainbow, June.
Here's a gold star for you.
Oh, Drew, wow!
You know, elephants don't have wings, but I like the way you're thinking. (chuckles)
Hey, Evan, what did you draw?
Oh.
Um...
That's a lot of red.
It's blood.
Okay.
So...
That man must be a doctor making the bloody man all better?
No, he's stabbing him in the guts with a sword.
Evan, that's... kind of a scary picture.
Nuh-unh, it's funny.
No, Honey, it's inappropriate, especially when the assignment was to make a picture that makes you happy.
This does make me happy.
Where's my gold star?
I just can't get used to everyone working--
First Bree, then Susan, now Lynette.
Thank God for you.
(chuckles) I just had to get out of that boring house.
So what do you gals do when you get together?
Mostly gossip.
Mm.
- You got any good gossip?
Ooh.
I heard Ed Simmons got a Harley.
You know, I should get back.
Come on.
Give me a break.
(laughs) I'm still new at this.
(sighs) Okay.
We'll start with something a little easier--bitching.
I can handle that.
Bitch away.
Well, I am so pissed at Carlos.
He is never home.
And when he is, he's too tired to do anything.
And by "anything," I mean sex.
Are you uncomfortable?
A little.
Go on.
Well, we've never had a drought like this.
It's been almost two weeks.
Two weeks?
And that's a drought for you?
Yeah.
Lately, Carlos just doesn't want to do it.
(imitates buzzer) Wrong.
Guys always wanna do it.
Really?
- Yeah.
Even if you're tired and get home late?
Even if we're exhausted and late and been shot in the leg...
twice.
We still want to.
So you just gotta get past the tired adult to find the horny teenage boy inside.
Huh.
That's good to know.
You're good at this girl talk thing.
Well, thanks. (chuckles)
So, um, does Lynette ever talk about me and sex?
Yeah, I should get back.
(laughs) You called me down here for this?
It's a kid playing with a soccer ball.
It's a head, and he's stabbing someone with a sword.
Well, maybe it was in self-defense.
Mr. Mayer, generally, when kids exhibit this type of behavior, there's a problem.
(cell phone rings) Excuse me.
I have to take this.
Sorry.
(ring)
(beep) Hello?
Thanks for ratting out my kid on his first day.
It's not my fault.
I showed this to the school psychologist.
She gave it to the principal.
My hands were tied.
So right away it's Evan's fault?
Did you ever consider that he didn't understand the assignment?
I told the class to draw something that made them happy.
All the other kids drew kittens and rainbows.
Your son drew small intestines on the end of a stick.
Let's cut to what this is really about.
You hate me, and you don't want my son in your class.
That is not true!
- It is, too!
You're still punishing me for what happened between us.
You're stuck in the past and blaming me for your screwed-up life!
- Okay, will someone call Guinness?
Because you just set the world record for the biggest load of crap in one sentence.
Oh, bite me!
How long was I gone?
Uh...
This is nothing, Mr. Hobson.
We were just having a difference of opinion.
Yeah, and my opinion is your teacher doesn't understand the difference between emotional problems and creativity.
(lowered voice) Shut up, Karl.
Excuse me.
Did you just tell him to shut up?
You know, this is typical "Susan" behavior.
And you wonder why no man can stay with you.
(spits)
Would this seem any less shocking if I told you we were once married for 12 years?
Yes, am I speaking to Mr. Dinsmore?
Ah, this is Bree Van de Kamp.
Yes, it's nice to talk to you, too.
Well, as I'm sure you're aware, your company has made several offers to purchase mine.
Yes, I know I said I wasn't interested, but some things have happened in my personal life and I think I'm ready to... finally make a deal.
Really?
Well, that's wonderful.
Why don't you, uh, come to my office tomorrow and we'll talk?
Goodye, Mr. Dinsmore.
Ok, there you go.
The rest is yours.
Thanks.
I don't know what it is.
Every time I go to the market, there's stuff I forget.
I know what it is.
You're old.
(chuckles)
So where's Dave?
- Camping.
Ooh, camping.
How fun.
Enjoying the great outdoors, getting a bunch of teenage kids on prom weekend.
Good for him.
Look, I know that you think he's some creepy psycho.
But you should know that he has had a very hard life, and there are things about him that you don't understand.
Like what?
Like he was married before, and his wife died in an accident along with their 3-year-old daughter.
Oh, Edie.
Are you sure?
Yes.
So if at times his behavior seems a little strange, try to remember the grief he's carrying.
You know, I lost a kid.
It does things to you.
No wonder he...
Oh, God, I wish I'd known.
Well, you do now.
So next time, try to be a little more understanding.
Of course.
You know, I could use a drink.
Come to my house and we'll crank up Dean Martin and... toss a few back.
(clicks tongue) Come on.
(beeps)
Mom?
Oh, Andrew.
I didn't hear you come in.
That Dinsmore guy is waiting for you downstairs.
Thank you, dear.
I must say, Bree.
I was surprised to get your call.
You've always said you'd never sell your company.
Bree has decided she wants more family time.
She's a very traditional woman, you know.
It's one of the reasons I fell in love with her.
Does that mean you're going to stop working altogether?
I know your fans have been hoping for a second book, uh, my wife included.
(chuckles)
(sighs) That's sweet, but I've decided to focus on other pursuits at the moment.
Mm, yes, her sole ambition now is to be Mrs. Orson Hodge.
And at the risk of sounding selfish,
I'm glad I'll be the only one she's cooking for. (chuckles)
Were you able to look over the contracts I sent over?
Oh, shoot.
I left them upstairs.
Oh.
Well, I'll get them.
I'll show you the offices before we start the demolition.
You're getting rid of your office?
No, we don't need it anymore, and Bree knows I've always wanted a game room.
So it's your "sole ambition" to be Mrs. Orson Hodge?
Andrew.
No, I-I have to ask.
Why are you letting Orson sell your company?
It was my idea.
My work has been compromising my marriage.
I didn't realize the toll it's been taking on Orson.
Okay, so he's unhappy.
Buy him some golf clubs, put him on lithium, but don't give up everything you've worked so hard for.
Andrew, do you know why my book sold so well?
Because it was authentic.
I actually believe in the old-fashioned values I wrote about.
I believe in men opening doors for ladies and children respecting their elders.
I also believe that sometimes women need to make sacrifices for their husbands.
I would be the worst kind of hypoite if I preached these values and then didn't follow them myself.
Okay, I get it.
You love Orson, and you're willing to sell your company to prove it.
What I'm wondering is, is if he loves you, why would he want you to stop doing what makes you happy?
(scoffs)
(door opens and closes)
Hey.
You busy?
What is it?
(chuckles) I brought you a little gift.
Oh.
Cute.
I thought it would be a nice addition to your collection.
Uh-huh.
I knew it was you.
Pardon?
You're the one who complained about me to Carlos.
I'm... not sure what you're talking about.
Oh, jeez.
What, you knife me in the back, and now you're gonna play stupid?
Carlos said some people are having problems with me and that I should watch my demeanor.
And I thought to myself, who are "some people"?
And then it hit me-- it's the chummy neighbor.
Okay, yes, Carlos and I spoke briefly, but I thought he blew me off.
- So that's your defense?
You thought your backstabbing was unsuccessful?
(chuckles) Well, I'll admit it's kind of flimsy, but until I got something better...
Okay, next time you have an issue with me, you know where my office is.
Oh, and, uh, as far as Friday nights are concerned... consider that a permanent work night.
Don't worry.
If you're as bad at coaching as you are at office politics, your daughter won't be missing much.
Found the contract.
Everything is in order.
All we need now is your signature.
- Mr. Dimore, would you mind if I speak to my husband for a moment?
Oh, yeah, please, go ahead.
I'll--I'll be right outside.
What's wrong?
(sighs) This is happening so fast.
Yes, a bit.
But it was your idea.
Well, I have a new idea.
I'd like to wait.
Wait?
But I-I need this for my recovery.
Just give me one year.
That's not asking too much, is it?
You made me a promise.
You need to stick to it.
Orson, think about how I built this company from nothing, how it brings me joy and pride and a sense of accomplishment.
Is that really something you want me to give up?
Yes.
Mr. Dinsmore, would you come back in, please?
So are we ready?
Actually, no.
I'm not selling.
Excuse me?
Tell your wife
I will be doing that second book after all.
Well, I'm--I'm sorry to hear that.
(lowered voice) Bree...
What about my problem?
I might start stealing again.
Steal what you must, my love.
But it won't be my company.
(laughs ) Look at him.
He's out like a light already.
That's what a long day of fishing does to you.
Yeah, well, he's gonna need all of his energy for our big hike tomorrow, right?
Actually, I don't think I'm gonna go with you guys.
My knee's been kind of bothering me.
Okay, well, then why don't we wait till the next day and see how you feel?
No, no, it's fine.
I'm just gonna hang out here.
Besides, it's such a romantic hike.
You guys should do it alone.
You always have such a good attitude.
Do I?
- Uh-huh.
It seems like you take everything in stride, you know?
Like you just naturally find the silver lining.
Yeah, I wish it were natural.
I had to teach myself to be this way.
With some of the stuff that's happened to me,
I never would've survived if I hadn't.
So what's your secret?
Oh, I realized that...
I was waiting for somebody to fix things.
But no one was going to.
It was all up to me.
I had to decide what was important
And go after it.
I had to make myself happy.
(whispers) Are you?
(normal voice) Happy.
I'm gettin' there.
Why don't you get some sleep?
You got a big day tomorrow.
Come on, Lucy.
Why would you agree to this meeting?
Well, we're overextended as it is.
(scoffs)
Fine.
Yeah, I'll see you at the conference room at 7:00 A.M.
Hi there.
Hey, babe.
What are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep.
I was a little hot.
(whispers) That's better.
(normal voice) You look a little warm yourself.
Okay, I know where you're going with this.
Oh, if that were true, your pants would be around your ankles right now.
(sighs) Gaby what are you doing?
I'm releasing the horny teen inside of you. (grunts)
Now come on.
Two boobs, no waiting.
- Damn it, Gaby,
I thought we were gonna wait till the weekend.
I'm tired.
(sighs) Not my problem.
(scoffs)
Actually, it is!
You know, if big Carlos is tired, that pretty much rules out little Carlos, too.
Now listen up, the pair of you.
I haven't been sitting around in butt floss all night for my health.
You're putting out.
(grunts)
(kissing)
Oh!
Ahh!
That's more like it!
Well, I'm awake now.
In fact... mind if we spice it up a bit?
(squeals and laughs)
I forgot these were in the nightstand.
This is gonna be fun.
Mm-hmm.
There.
How's that?
Tight, just the way I like it.
(chuckles)
- Me, too.
Mmm.
Good night.
Carlos, where you going?
To go grab a few hours sleep before I have to get back to work.
Carlos, get back here!
Carlos!
(door opens)
(grunts)
Could you at least scratch my nose?
!
Amy, that is very sweet.
I love the colors you used.
Oh, Danielle, that is just beautiful.
Hmm.
Oh.
Evan, that is very pretty.
You did the assignment just like I asked.
Good job!
That's not mine.
Annie asked me to bring hers up for her.
This one's mine.
(gasps)
(beeps)
(bangs table)
(whispers) Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
(laughs softly)
- Oh!
Don't wake him up.
(whispers) I know.
Ow!
- Come on.
(grunts)
(grunting and panting)
(whirs)
(grunts)
(speaking indistinctly)
(Mike) I know.
(sighs) (Mike speaking indistinctly)
(cell phone rings)
(bullet ricochets) (gasps)
(grunts) (ring, beep)
What is that?
- Let's just go back.
Let's go back.
(Mike speaks indistinctly)
I heard a gunshot.
It sounded like a hunting rifle.
Yeah, it almost hit Katherine.
- You guys all right?
Yeah, I think so.
Hey, this is a State Park.
People aren't supposed to be hunting here.
Well, I guess these guys don't care about that.
I just wanna get out of here.
Please?
- Yeah, of course.
We'll, uh, go back and pack, and we'll leave.
Well, sorry, man.
Me, too.
Juanita!
Celia!
Get your coats on!
We're going to see daddy.
Let me see it.
- Okay, just so you know,
I should be bringing this to the psychologist.
But I didn't, because this kind of "self-expression"
usually gets kids expelled.
- Just let me see it.
Aw, hell.
Yeah, "aw, hell."
You got a problem here, Karl.
Your son's got some serious anger issues, and you need to figure out what's going on.
I know what's going on.
This is his mom.
Marisa?
Well, why would he draw a picture of her like this?
She left us...
Six weeks ago.
Oh.
Karl...
I woke up one day to find her standing there with her bags packed.
She said she was overwhelmed, that she loved Evan but she wasn't cut out to be a mother.
So she just left?
So here I am, alone, raising this boy.
And it's obvious I'm not doing a very good job.
(exhales deeply)
You must be loving this.
Why?
'Cause I did the exact same thing to you.
Oh.
Yeah.
You know, I can understand why you react the way you do when you bump into me, why it bothers you.
I never really got it until just now.
I used to hope that one day, you would know what this felt like, and now that you do...
I'm so sorry.
Oh!
Hey, Lynette!
- Hi!
Great office.
I see you're busy.
Don't let me disturb you.
I just wanted to drop off the girls so I could talk to Carlos for a sec.
All right, girls, have fun with Aunt Lynette.
You think you can buy me off with presents?
Gaby, now is not a good time.
Well, I'd say let's talk about it tonight, but who knows if you're even gonna come home?
(sighs) Damn it, Gaby.
You're the one that pushed me take this job.
And ever since I did, all you've done is complain about how hard I'm working.
You're right, and I'm sorry.
It's just...
I'm scared.
We're turning into what we used to be.
(voice breaks) I'm unhappy at home, you're always working, trying to buy me off with presents, too tired to make me feel loved.
We've made these mistakes before, Carlos.
For God sakes, let's not make 'em again.
(sighs) I made a commitment here, Gaby.
I don't think I can just bail.
I know you can't, and that's the part that really scares me.
We're bored.
Hey, I got you sodas, didn't I?
And I let you feed the paper shredder.
Don't you have any toys?
- No.
I got a hole puncher.
Sorry.
That's the best I could do.
Come on.
What about those glass things?
They're pretty.
Can I hold one?
Oh, sweetie, those aren't to play with, not unless you wanna see someone go completely bonkers.
Actually, they do look like a lot of fun.
If only I had the power to stop you...
What the hell are you doing?
!
We're playing.
What does it look like?
(sighs)
Are these your kids?
'Cause they were in my office playing with my figurines, which are imported.
They're worth a lot of dinero.
(Lucy) Do you even understand what I'm saying?
!
What's with the yelling?
I don't know.
I'm just as worried as you are.
Look, let me boil it down for you.
Office?
Sí.
Day care?
No!
Lucy, what's going on?
Apparently, some people don't understand that this is a place of business, and they need to keep their kids at home!
Then I guess you should yell at me.
These are my kids.
(whispers) Come here, sweetie.
(under breath) Oh, jeez.
(normal voice) I, uh, I didn't know that.
I-I thought they were hers 'cause they're... (sighs)
(whispers) Could you just go?
(normal voice) Um...
I'm sorry.
So what if they were?
That's the way you talk to people?
- I said I'm sorry.
Look, I-I am trying so hard to make this deal happen.
I guess the stress is just getting to me.
It's getting all of us.
Maybe it's a sign we should change the way we do things around here.
We are trying to play with the big boys, Carlos.
Now is not the time to pull back.
Don't you want this company to succeed?
I wanna build a company that treats its people well and lets them go home at night to see their families.
Look, I know I don't have the greatest bed side manner.
But you hired me to take this company to number one.
Now if you don't want to do that,
I'm probably not your girl.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Wow.
What happened to you?
The old Carlos would do anything to be the best.
I guess I'm not the old Carlos anymore.
Fine.
(singsongy) Don't forget your little animals!
(sighs)
Orson, please come upstairs.
I know what that couch does to your back.
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.
Know you're disappointed right now, but you have to know,
I really do want to find some way for you to be happy.
So do I.
(door closes)
(chuckles)
(sighs)
Hey, don't you want your stuff?
Oh, can I get it tomorrow?
I just really want to get home.
Edie?
I always wondered why you were so determined to live on Wisteria Lane.
You said you thought we'd be happy here, and I wanted to believe you.
But it turned out that you... just wanted to be close to Mike Delfino.
Who gave you that?
Nobody gave it to me.
I did research.
You think I'm too stupid to do research?
Edie, listen.
This doesn't mean anything.
It's all there--the accident, Mike's acquittal, and even a little mention of how...
David Dash couldn't make it to the funeral because he had a nervous breakdown.
Honey, look.
Just give me a chance to explain.
Oh, so now you want to explain?
(liquid pouring)
Okay, why don't you start by explaining why you married me?
I married you because I love you.
No!
You married me because you needed a cover story so you could get close to the man who killed your family.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah, it's insane.
But that's why you did it.
So what are you gonna do now?
You gonna hurt him?
I mean... (sighs) You know, that's the only.
(crumples paper)
Logical explanation.
And my only question is...
What the hell have you been waiting for?
Honey, you're not feeling well.
Let's get you upstairs into bed.
Tell me the truth, you freak.
Did you move us here to hurt Mike Delfino?
He destroyed... everything I ever loved, and he was never punished.
(sighs)
I need to make things right.
(cries) You?
Why did you have to do this?
(crying) We could've been so happy.
(sniffles)
(sighs)
What are you doing?
I'm gonna tell him before you...
(beeping)
Before you do something stupid.
- Edie, don't.
(phone rings)
Give me that.
(beep)
No!
Aah!
(grunts) (gags)
(telephone receiver drops)
(grunting)
(gasping and breathing deeply)
(cries)
(gasping)
(crying)
(door opens)
(rapid footsteps retreating, Edie crying)
(creak)
Get out of here!
Just get the hell out!
I'm calling the police!
Do you hear me?
(beeping)
(cries)
Aah!
(tires squeal)
Aah!
(loud pop)
(electricity crackling)
Yes, life is full of nasty shocks.
And they always seem to occur when we least expect them.
(crackling)
(electricity popping)
And once our system has been jolted, the question becomes, will we survive?
Subtitles by LeapinLar
Previously on... a thief was confronted.
Well, maybe you'll feel comfortable talking to a professional.
A psychiatrist?
Someone lit me a cigar.
Carlos hired a old girlfriend... and Gaby hired a spy.
I talked to Carlos.
You're in!
Edie dug deeper into Dave's past.
Killed three years ago-- car crash.
That was his wife.
Givee that one.
Their daughter died in the same crash.
And Dave's master plan... you really think I make that much of a difference in Mike's life?
If he ever lost you, it would destroy him.
Entered its final phase.
Is this the ranger station?
Well, I didn't know whether to call you or fish and game, but, uh, I think I saw some gu up at emerson ods hunting illegally, and I got worried because I know people like to go camping up there,
and I-I sure wouldn't want anyonto get hurt.
No, no need to thank me.
I'm just doing my part as a concerned citizen.
Bye now.
Dave Williams had been planning the murder for years.
And like all the best plans, it was a simple one.
First, he would guide Mike Delfino and Katherine Mayfair to a remote cabin.
The next morning, he'd pretend to be asleep as the two lovers left to go hiking.
Dave would then grab the gun he'd carefully hidden... and start to follow his quarry.
He'd wait until the two had paused for a moment to catch their breaths.
And then he'd pull the trigger... breaking the heart of the man who had killed his wife.
When the rangers arrived, they would mention the reports of illegal hunters in the area.
And Dave would drive Mike back home, all the while enjoying his pain.
Yes, Dave Williams had come up with a very simple plan.
But as he was about to discover... have you faxed this clipping to Edie Williams yet?
Um, doing it right now.
There is nothing simple... about murder.
Fairview Man******
Desperate Housewives Season05 Episode18
Life is full of nasty shocks... unpleasant surprises that jolt our systems... and cause our hearts to skip a beat.
and these shocks always occur...
- Susan?
- Hey, Karl.
When we ast expect them.
Karl.
What are you doing here?
Well, I just enrolled Evan.
And I was worried that we'd be out of each other's lives forever.
Mm, lucky, lucky.
What are you doing here?
I am an art teacher.
Really?
Do they know that?
And now I'm ignoring you and moving on to Evan.
Hello, Evan.
Evan, this is Susan.
She's your sister Julie's mother.
We used to be married.
She was a lot younger then.
Evan, why don't you head into the classroom?
I need to talk to your daddy, and I may need to use some grown-up words.
Okay, Susie Q. , What's wrong?
Get it off that chest you wouldn't let me enhance.
Listen, it's bad enough that I've got one ex-husband running around the halls.
I don't need the faculty and the parents knowing that I have two.
So not a word about us having been married.
No more wisecracks.
No Susie Q's.
I am miss Susan, art teacher.
Yes, miss Susan.
Can I bang your erasers after class?
Karl, I'm serious.
Don't mess with me.
I have a yardstick, and I'm not afraid to use it.
we're gonna be making a presentation for the morrison contract sooner than we planned.
There are a lot of firms gunning for this, and--damn it, Lynette!
Don't--don't touch my figurines.
These are worth more than the house you live in.
Big deal.
So is this coffee mug.
- All right, we should break for lunch.
- No.
Until this deal closes, we work through lunch.
But as a consolation, we'll also be working nights.
Nights?
You really think that's necessary?
This is a $10 million deal, Carlos.
How bad do you want it?
You heard the woman.
we're working nights.
Um, I have a tiny scheduling conflict.
I coach my daughter's basketball team on Friday nights.
So if I could--
Friday nights are now work nights.
If we're successful, those of you on commission stand to do very well.
And those of you who aren't?
Well, you get to keep your jobs, which, in this economy, is a bonus all by itself.
All right, let's run down to the deli, grab a sandwich and meet back here in five.
You.
No touching.
And, yes, I'll know.
Isn't she fun?
Hey, Carlos.
Did I ever tell you that tom a I seriously considered you and Gaby for Penny's godparents?
You're not getting Friday nights off.
Look, I'm not happy about the schedule either.
I'm missing my kids, too.
Then do something about it.
You're the president.
Put the brakes on Lucy.
Lynette, I hired her to crack the whip, and that's what she's doing.
It's good for the company.
But she makes people crazy.
Can't you talk to her, get her to dial it down a bit?
I will think about it.
But don't be asking me for favors like this.
When we're at the office, I'm not your neighbor, I'm not your friend.
I'm your boss.
Got it?
Oh, by the way, you and tom are coming over for cocktails on Saturday.
Oh, yeah.
I plan to get drunk and bitch about my boss.
I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.
Do you at least know why he steals?
If there were some sordid childhood trauma we could blame it on, it would really help me out with the neighbors.
Oh, he knows.
Dr. Bernstein uncovered that my very first session.
Really?
And--and yet he keeps charging me.
So, doctor, what's this "revelation" that you've been keeping from me for $200 an hour?
I steal to hurt you.
Why would you want to hurt me?
Each day for the past year, you have, inch by inch, slice by slice, brought me closer to being a eunuch.
Would you excuse us for moment?
This just became a private conversation.
If I stay, I might be able to help.
You wanna help?
Why don't you go down to the pharmacy in the lobby and buy some aspirin?
I'm gonna need it.
I don't deserve this.
I have been nothing busupportive of you since you got out of jail.
I even gave you a job.
I wanted to be your partner.
You made me an employee.
So you decided to punish me by resorting to petty theft?
For God sakes, Orson, I'm your wife.
Perhaps, but I'm not your husband.
We may share a bed, but you save your passion for your company.
- That's not true!
- Isn't it?
Every day for the past year, I have been in the background, an afterthought, while you spend day and night nurturing your business.
All the while thinking I had your support.
I tried.
I thought I wouldn't mind being Mr. Bree Van de Kamp.
But it's killing me.
Every day, I get smaller and smaller.
And if something doesn't change,
Orson Hodge is just gonna disappear altogether.
Girls are out like a light.
Thanks for dinner.
Carlos, do you have to go back to work?
Gaby, I got a meeting.
But can't Lucy cover it?
You know those two extras zeroes at the end of my paycheck you like so much?
They're there because I'm president.
Hours are part of the gig.
How about a quickie?
Babe, I don't have time.
Right, that's why I didn't suggest a longie.
Oh, come on.
I'll have your eyes rolling back in your head in three minutes flat.
You wanna do it there in front of the kids' sippy cups?
All gone.
Now let's do this.
It'll be like old times.
We never did it on the table.
Yeah, we did, years ago.
Don't you remember?
I don't think that was me.
Right.
Well, we'll create new table memoes.
If you're trying to turn me on, you just failed miserably.
Carlos, do you realize since Bradley died and you took over, we haven't had sex once?
I miss you.
I wanna spend time with you.
Now move the creamed corn and do me!
Okay, how about tomorrow night?
Yeah, I've heard that before, and then tomorrow comes, and you're too tired.
Okay, then, this weekend.
I'll be all yours.
And we can defile any piece of furniture you want.
Hey, Karen, you don't have any fax paper, do you?
Fax paper!
Turn down the Dean Martin!
Don't worry about it.
I'll go to the store tomorrow.
Do you need anything?
Eggs... milk...
lightbulbs...
Okay, let's make this easier.
Is there athing you don't need?
I'll tell you what.
I'll call you from the store in the morning, okay?
One*****
What a lovely rainbow, June.
Here's a gold star for you.
Oh, Drew, wow!
You know, elephants don't have wings, but I like the way you're thinking.
Hey, Evan, what did you draw?
That's a lot of red.
It's blood.
Okay.
So... that man must be a doctor making the bloody man all better?
No, he's stabbing him in the guts with a sword.
Evan, that's... kind of a scary picture.
Nuh-unh, it's fu
No, honey, it's inappropriate, especially when the assignment was to make a picture that makes you happy.
This does make me happy.
Where's my gold star?
I just can't get used to everyone working-- first Bree, then Susan, now Lynette.
Thank God for you.
I just had to get out of that boring house.
So what do you gals do when you get together?
Mostly gossip.
You got any good gossip?
I heard Ed Simmons got a Harley.
You know, I should get back.
Come on.
Give me a break.
I'm still new at this.
Okay.
We'll start with something a little easier--bitching.
I can handle that.
Bitch away.
Well, I am so pissed at Carlos.
He is never home.
And when he is, he's too tired to do anything.
And by "anything," I mean sex.
- Are you uncomfortable?
- A little.
Go on.
Well, we've never had a drought like this.
It's been almost two weeks.
Two weeks?
And that's a drought for you?
Yeah.
Lately, Carlos just doesn't want to do it.
Wrong.
Guys always wanna do it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Even if you're tired and get home late?
Even if we're exhausted and late and been shot in the leg... twice.
We still want to.
So you just gotta get past the (red adult to find the horny teenage boy inside.
That's good to know.
You're good at this girl talk thing.
Well, thanks.
So, um, does Lynette ever talk about me and sex?
Yeah, I should get back.
You called me down here for this?
It's a kid playing with a soccer ball.
It's a head, and he's stabbing someone with a sword.
Well, maybe it was in self-defense.
Mr. Mayer, generally, when kids exhibit this type of behavior, there's a problem.
Excuse me.
I have to take this.
Sorry.
Hello?
Thanks for ratting out my kid on his first day.
It's not my fault.
I showed this to the school psychologist.
She gave it to the principal.
My hands were tied.
So right away it's Evan's fault?
Did you ever consider that he didn't understand the assignment?
I told the class to draw something that made them happy.
All the other kids drew kittens and rainbows.
Your son drew small intestines on the end of a stick.
Let's cut to what this is really about.
You hate me, and you don't want my son in your class.
- That is not true!
- It is, too!
You're still punishing me for what happened between us.
You're stuck in the past and blaming me for your screwed-up life!
Okay, will someone call Guinness?
Because you just set the world record for the biggest load of crap in one sentence.
Oh, bite me!
How long was I gone?
This is nothing, Mr. Hobson.
We were just having a difference of opinion.
Yeah, and my opinion is your teacher doesn't understand the difference between emotional problems and creativity.
- Shut up, Karl.
- Excuse me.
Did you just tell him to shut up?
You know, this is typical "Susan" behavior.
And you wonder why no man can stay with you.
Would this seem any less shocking if I told you we were once married for 12 years?
Yes, am I speaking to Mr. Dinsmore?
Ah, this is Bree Van de Kamp.
Yes, it's nice to talk to you, too.
Well, as I'm sure you're aware, your company has made several offers to purchase mine.
Yes, I know I said I wasn't interested, but some things have happened in my personal life and I think I'm ready to... finally make a deal.
Really?
Well, that's wonderful.
Why don't you, uh, come to my office tomorrow and we'll talk?
Good-bye, Mr. Dinsmore.
There you go.
The rest is yours.
Thanks.
I don't know what it is.
Every time I go to the market, there's stuff I forget.
I know what it is.
You're old.
- So where's Dave?
- Camping.
Ooh, camping.
How fun.
Enjoying the great outdoors, getting a bunch of teenage kids on prom weekend.
Good for him.
Look, I know that you think he's some creepy psycho.
But you should know that he has had a very hard life, and there are things about him that you don't understand.
Like what?
Like he was married before, and his wife died in an accident along with their 3-year-old daughter.
Oh, Edie.
Are you sure?
Yes.
So if at times his behavior seems a little strange, try to remember the grief he's carrying.
You know, I lost a kid.
It does things to you.
No wonder he...
Oh, God, I wish I'd known.
Well, you do now.
So next time, try to be a little more understanding.
Of course.
You know, I could use a drink.
Come to my house and we'll crank up Dean Martin and... toss a few back.
Come on.
Mom?
Oh, Andrew.
I didn't hear you come in.
That dinsmore guy is waiting for you downstairs.
Thank you, dear.
I must say, Bree.
I was surprised to get your call.
You've always said you'd never sell your company.
Bree has decided she wants more family time.
She's a very traditional woman, you know.
It's one of the reasons I fell in love with her.
Does that mean you're gog to stop working altogether?
I know your fans have been hoping for a second book, uh, my wife included.
That's sweet, but I've decided to focus on other pursuits at the moment.
Mm, yes, her sole ambition now is to be Mrs. Orson Hodge.
And at the risk of sounding selfish, I'm glad I'll be the only one she's cooking for.
Were you able to look over the contracts I sent over?
Oh, shoot.
I left them upstairs.
Well, I'll get them.
I'll show you the offices before we start the demolition.
You're getting rid of your office?
No, we don't need it anymore, and Bree knows I've always wanted a game room.
So it's your "sole ambition" to be Mrs. Orson Hodge?
Andrew.
No, I-I have to ask.
Why are you letting Orson se your company?
It was my idea.
My work has been compromising my marriage.
I didn't realize the toll it's been taking on Orson.
Okay, so he's unhappy.
Buy him some golf clubs, put him on lithium, but don't give up everything you've worked so hard for.
Andrew, do you know why my book sold so well?
Because it was authentic.
I actually believe in the old-fashioned values I wrote about.
I believe in men opening doors for ladies and children respecting their elders.
I also believe that sometimes women need to make sacrifices for their husbands.
I would be the worst kind of hypoite if I preached these values and then didn't follow them myself.
Okay, I get it.
You love Orson, and you're willing to sell your company to prove it.
What I'm wondering is, is if he loves you, why would he want you to stop doing what makes you happy?
You busy?
What is it?
I brought you a little gift.
Cute.
I thought it would be a nice addition to your collection.
- I knew it was you.
- Pardon?
You're the one who complained about me to Carlos.
I'm...not sure what you're talking about.
Oh, jeez.
What, you knife me in the back, and now you're gonna play stupid?
Carlos said some people are having problems with me and that I should watch my demeanor.
And I thought to myself, who are "some people"?
And then it hit me-- it's the chummy neighbor.
Okay, yes, Carlos and I spoke briefly, but I thought he blew me off.
So that's your defense?
You thought your backstabbing was unsuccessful?
well, I'll admit it's kind of flimsy, but until I got something better... okay, next time you have an issue with me, you know where my office is.
Oh, and, uh, as far as Friday nights are concerned... consider that a permanent work night.
Don't worry.
If you're as bad at coaching as you are at office politics, your daughter won't be missing much.
Found the contract.
Everything is in ord.
All we need now is your signature.
Mr. Dinsmore, would you mind if I speak to my husband for a moment?
Oh, yeah, please, go ahead.
I'll--I'll be right outside.
What's wrong?
this is happening so fast.
Yes, a bit.
But it was your idea.
Well, I have a new idea.
I'd like to wait.
Wait?
Bui-I need this for my recovery.
Just give me one year.
That's not asking too much, is it?
You made me a promise.
You need to stick to it.
Orson, think about how I built this company from nothing, how it brings me joy and pride and a sense of accomplishment.
Is that really something you want me to give up?
Yes.
Mr. Dinsmore, would you come back in, please?
So are we ready?
Actually, no.
I'm not selling.
Excuse me?
Tell your wife I will be doing that second book after all.
Well, I'm--I'm sorry to hear that.
Bree...what about my problem?
I might start stealing again.
Steal what you must, my love.
But it won't be my company.
Look at him.
He's out like a light already.
That's what a long day of fishing does to you.
Yeah, well, he's gonna need all of his energy for our big hike tomorrow, right?
Actually, I don't think I'm gonna go with you guys.
My knee's been kind of bothering me.
Okay, well, then why don't we wait till the next day and see how you feel?
No, no, it's fine.
I'm just gonna hang out here.
Besides, it's such a romantic hike.
You guys should do it alone.
You always have such a good attitude.
Do I?
It seems like you take everything in stride, you know?
Like you just naturally find the silver lining.
Yeah, I wish it were natural.
I had to teach myself to be this way.
With some of the stuff that's happened to me, I never would've survived if I hadn't.
So what's your secret?
Oh, I realized that...
I was waiting for somebody to fix things.
But no one was going to.
It was all up to me.
I had to decide what was important and go after it.
I had to make myself happy.
Are you?
Happy.
I'm gettin' there.
Why don't you get some sleep?
You got a big day tomorrow.
Come on, Lucy.
Why would you agree to this meeting?
Well, we're overextended as it is.
Fine.
Yeah, I'll see you at the conference room at 7:00 A.M.
Hi there.
Hey, babe.
What are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep.
I was a little hot.
That's better.
You look a little warm yourself.
Okay, I know where you're going with this.
Oh, if that were true, your pants would be around your ankles right now.
Gaby, what are you doing?
I'm releasing the horny teen inside of you.
Now come on.
Two boobs, no waiting.
Damn it, Gaby, I thought we were gonna wait till the weekend.
I'm tired.
Not my problem.
Actually, it is!
You know, if big Carlos is tired, that pretty much rules out little Carlos, too.
Now listen up, the pair of you.
I haven't been sitting around in butt floss all night for my health.
You're putting out.
That's more like it!
Well, I'm awake now.
In fact... mind if we spice it up a bit?
I forgot these were in the nightstand.
This is gonna be fun.
There.
How's that?
Tight, just the way I like it.
Me, too.
Good night.
Carlos, where you going?
To go grab a few hours sleep before I have to get back to work.
Carlos, get back here!
Carlos!
Could you at least scratch my nose?
Amy, that is very sweet.
I love the colors you used.
Oh, Danielle, that is just beautiful.
Evan, that is very pretty.
You did the assignment just like I asked.
Good job!
That's not mine.
Annie asked me to bring hers up for her.
This one's mine.
Fairview man won't be charged in accident that killed two
I know everything come home now, Edie
I heard a gunshot.
It sounded like a hunting rifle.
Yeah, it almost hit Katherine.
You guys all right?
Yeah, I think so.
Hey, this is a state park.
People aren't supposed to be hunting here.
Well, I guess these guys don't care about that.
I just wanna get out of here.
Please?
Yeah, of course.
We'll, uh, go back and pack, and we'll leave.
Well, sorry, man.
Me, too.
Sorry about last night, I love you, Carlos
Juanita!
Celia!
Get your coats on!
We're going to see daddy.
Let me see it.
Okay, just so you know, should be bringing this to the psychologist.
But I didn't, because this kind of "self-expression" usually gets a kid expelled.
Just let me see it.
Aw, hell.
Yeah, "aw, hell."
You got a problem here, Karl.
Your son's got some serious anger issues, and you need to figure out what's going on.
I know what's going on.
This is his mom.
Marisa?
Well, why would he draw a picture of her like this?
She left us...six weeks ago.
Karl...
I woke up one day to find her standing there with her bags packed.
She said she was overwhelmed, that she loved Evan but she wasn't cut out to be a mother.
So she just left?
So here I am, alone, raising this boy.
And it's obvious I'm not doing a very good job.
You must be loving this.
Why?
'Cause I did the exact same thing to you.
Yeah.
You know, I can understand why you react the way you do when you bump into me, why it bothers you.
I never really got it until just now.
I usedo hope that one day, you would know what this fe like, and now that you do...
I'm so sorry.
Hey, Lynette!
Great office.
I see you're busy.
Don't let me disturb you.
I just wanted to drop off the girls so I could talk to Carlos for a sec.
All right, girls, have fun with aunt Lynette.
You think you can buy me off with presents?
Gaby, now is not a good time.
Well, I'd say let's talk about it tonight, but who knows if you're even gonna come home?
Damn it, Gaby.
You're the one that pushed me take this job.
And ever since I did, all you've done is complain about how hard I'm working.
You're right, and I'm sorry.
It's just...
I'm scared.
We're turning into what we used to be.
I'm unhappy at home, you're always working, trying to buy me off wh presents, too tired to make me feel loved.
We've made these mistakes before, Carlos.
For God sakes, let's not make 'em again.
I made a commitment here, Gaby.
I don't think I can just bail.
I know you can't, and that's the part that really scares me.
We're bored.
Hey, I got you sodas, didn't I?
And I let you feed the paper shredder.
Don't you have any toys?
No.
I got a hole puncher.
Sorry.
That's the best I could do.
Come on.
What about those glass things?
They're pretty.
Can I hold one?
Oh, sweetie, those aren't to play with, not unless you wanna see someone go completely bonkers.
Actually, they do look like a lot of fun.
If only I had the power to stop you... what the hell are you doing?
We're playing.
What does it look like?
Are these your kids?
'Cause they were in my office playing with my figurines, which are imported.
They're worth a lot of dinero.
Do you even undstand what I'm saying?
What's with the yelling?
I don't know.
I'm just as worried as you are.
Look, let me boil it down for you.
Office?
S?
Day care?
No!
Lucy, what's going on?
Apparently, some people don't understand that this is a place of business, and they need to keep their kids at home!
Then I guess you should yell at me.
These are my kids.
Come here, sweetie.
I, uh, I didn't know that.
I-I thought they were hers 'cause they're... could you just go?
I'm sorry.
So what if they were?
That's the way you talk to people?
I said I'm sorry.
Look, I-I am trying so hard to make this deal happen.
I guess the stress is just getting to me.
It's getting all of us.
Maybe it's a sign we should change the way we do things around here.
We are trying to play with the big boys, Carlos.
Now is not the time to pull back.
Don't you want this company to succeed?
I wanna build a company that treats its people well and lets them go home at night to see their families.
Look, I know I don't have the greatest beside manner.
But you hired me to take this company to number one.
Now if you don't want to do that, I'm probably not your girl.
I was just thinking the same thing.
What happened to you?
The old Carlos would do anything to be the best.
I guess I'm not the old Carlos anymore.
Fine.
Don't forget your little animals!
Orson, please come upstairs.
I know what that couch does to your back.
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.
Know you're disappointed right now, but you have to know, I really do want to find some way for you to be happy.
So do I.
Hey, don't you want your stuff?
Oh, can I get it tomorrow?
I just really want to get home.
Edie?
I always wondered why you were so determined to live on wisteria lane.
You said you thought we'd be happy here, and I wanted to believe you.
But it turned out that you... just wanted to be close to Mike Delfino.
Who gave you that?
Nobody gave it to me.
I did research.
You think I'm too stupid to do research?
Edie, listen.
This doesn't mean anything.
It's all there--the accident, Mike's acquittal, and even a little mention of how...
David Dash couldn't make it to the funeral because he had a nervous breakdown.
Honey, look.
Just give me a chance to explain.
Oh, so now you want to explain?
Okay, why don't you start by explaining why you married me?
I married you because I love you.
No!
You married me because you needed a cover story so you could get close to the man who killed your family.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah, it's insane.
But that's why you did it.
So what are you gonna do now?
You gonna hurt him?
I mean...you know, that's the only.
Logical explanation.
And my only question is... what the hell have you been waiting for?
Honey, you're not feeling well.
Let's get you upstairs into bed.
Tell me the truth, you freak.
Did you move us here to hurt Mike Delfino?
He destroyed...everything I ever loved, and he was never punished.
I need to make things right.
Why?
Why did you have to do this?
We could've been so happy.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna tell him before you... before you do something stupid.
Edie, don't.
Give me that.
No!
Get out of here!
Just get the hell out!
I'm calling the police!
Do you hear me?
Yes, life is full of nasty shocks.
And they always seem occur when we least expect them.
And once our system has been jolted, the question becomes, will we survive?
To be continued
Previously on...
A thief was confronted.
Well, maybe you'll feel comfortable talking to a professional.
- A psychiatrist?
Someone light me a cigar.
- Carlos hired a old girlfriend... and Gaby hired a spy.
- I talked to Carlos.
You're in!
Edie dug deeper into Dave's past.
Killed three years ago-- car crash.
That was his wife.
Give me that one.
Their daughter died in the same crash.
And Dave's master plan...
- You really think I make that much of a difference in Mike's life?
If he ever lost you, it would destroy him.
entered its final phase.
Uh, hi.
Is this the ranger station?
Well, I didn't know whether to call you or fish and game, but, uh, I think I saw some guys up at Emerson Woods hunting illegally, and I got worried because I know people like to go camping up there,
and I-I sure wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.
Oh.
No, no need to thank me.
I'just doing my part as a concerned citizen.
Bye now.
DaveWilliams had been planning the murder for years.
And like all the best plans, it was a simple one.
First, he would guide
Mike Delfino and Katherine Mayfair to a remote cabin.
The next morning, he'd pretend to be asleep as the two lovers left to go hiking.
Dave would then grab the gun he'd carefully hidden... and start to follow his quarry.
He'd wait until the two had paused for a moment to catch their breaths.
And then he'd pull the trigger... breaking the heart of the man who had killed his wife.
When the rangers arrived, they would mention the reports of illegal hunters in the area.
And Dave would drive Mike back home, all the while enjoying his pain.
Yes,
Dave Williams had come up with a very simple plan.
Ugh!
But as he was about to discover...
Have you faxed this clipping to Edie Williams yet?
Um, doing it right now.
there is nothing simple... about murder.
Life is full of nasty shocks... unpleasant surprises that jolt our systems... and cause our hearts to skip a beat.
And these shocks always occur...
Susan?
- Hey, Karl.
when we least expect them.
Karl.
What are you doing here?
Well, I just enrolled Evan.
Wow.
And I was worried that we'd be out of each other's lives forever.
Mm, lucky, lucky.
What are you doing here?
- I am an art teacher.
Really?
Do they know that?
And now I'm ignoring you and moving on to Evan.
Hello, Evan.
Evan, this is Susan.
She's your sister Julie's mother.
We used to be married.
She was a lot younger then.
Evan, why don't you head into the classroom?
I need to talk to your daddy, and I may need to use some grown-up words.
Okay, Susie Q., what's wrong?
Get it off that chest you wouldn't let me enhance.
Listen, it's bad enough that I've got one ex-husband running around the halls.
I don't need the faculty and the parents knowing that I have two.
So not a word about us having been married.
No more wisecracks.
No Susie Q's.
I am Miss Susan, art teacher.
Yes, Miss Susan.
Can I bang your erasers after class?
Karl, I'm serious.
Don't mess with me.
I have a yardstick, and I'm not afraid to use it.
We're gonna be making a presentation for the Morrison contract sooner than we planned.
There are a lot of firms gunning for this, and--damn it, Lynette!
Don't--don't touch my figurines.
These are worth more than the house you live in.
Big deal.
- So is this coffee mug.
All right, we should break for lunch.
No.
Until this deal closes, we work through lunch.
But as a consolation, we'll also be working nights.
Nights?
You really think that's necessary?
This is a $10 million deal, Carlos.
How bad do you want it?
You heard the woman.
We're working nights.
Um, I have a tiny scheduling conflict.
I coach my daughter's basketball team on Friday nights.
So if I could--
- Friday nights are now work nights.
If we're successful, those of you on commission stand to do very well.
And those of you who aren't?
Well, you get to keep your jobs, which, in this economy, is a bonus all by itself.
All right, let's run down to the deli, grab a sandwich and meet back here in five.
You.
No touching.
And, yes, I'll know.
Isn't she fun?
Hey, Carlos.
Did I ever tell you that Tom and I seriously considered you and Gaby for Penny's godparents?
- You're not getting Friday nights off.
Look, I'm not happy about the schedule either.
I'm missing my kids, too.
- Then do something about it.
You're the President.
Put the brakes on Lucy.
Lynette, I hired her to crack the whip, and that's what she's doing.
It's good for the company.
But she makes people crazy.
Can't you talk to her, get her to dial it down a bit?
I will think about it.
But don't be asking me for favors like this.
When we're at the office, I'm not your neighbor,
I'm not your friend.
I'm your boss.
Got it?
Oh, by the way, you and Tom are coming over for cocktails on Saturday.
Oh, yeah.
I plan to get drunk and bitch about my boss.
I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.
Do you at least know why he steals?
If there were some sordid childhood trauma we could blame it on, it would really help me out with the neighbors.
Oh, he knows.
Dr. Bernstein uncovered that my very first session.
Really?
And--and yet he keeps charging me.
So, doctor, what's this "revelation"
that you've been keeping from me for $200 an hour?
I steal to hurt you.
Why would you want to hurt me?
Each day for the past year, you have, inch by inch, slice by slice, brought me closer to being a eunuch.
Would you excuse us for moment?
This just became a private conversation.
If I stay, I might be able to help.
You wanna help?
Why don't you go down to the pharmacy in the lobby and buy some aspirin?
I'm gonna need it.
I don't deserve this.
I have been nothing but supportive of you since you got out of jail.
I even gave you a job.
I wanted to be your partner.
You made me an employee.
So you decided to punish me by resorting to petty theft?
For God sakes, Orson, I'm your wife.
Perhaps, but I'm not your husband.
We may share a bed, but you save your passion for your company.
That's not true!
- Isn't it?
Every day for the past year, I have been in the background, an afterthought,
While you spend day and night nurturing your business.
All the while thinking I had your support.
I tried.
I thought I wouldn't mind being Mr. Bree Van de Kamp.
But it's killing me.
Every day, I get smaller and smaller.
And if something doesn't change,
Orson Hodge is just gonna disappear altogether.
Girls are out like a light.
Thanks for dinner.
Carlos, do you have to back to work?
- Gaby, I got a meeting.
But can't Lucy cover it?
You know those two extras zeroes at the end of my paycheck you like so much?
They're there because I'm President.
Hours are part of the gig.
Hey.
How about a quickie?
Babe, I don't have time.
Right, that's why I didn't suggest a longie.
Oh, come on.
I'll have your eyes rolling back in your head in three minutes flat.
You wanna do it there in front of the kids' sippy cups?
All gone.
Now let's do this.
It'll be like old times.
We never did it on the table.
Yeah, we did, years ago.
Don't you remember?
I don't think that was me.
Oh.
Right.
Well, we'll create new table memories.
If you're trying to turn me on, you just failed miserably.
Carlos, do you realize since Bradley died and you took over, we haven't had sex once?
I miss you.
I wanna spend time with you.
Now move the creamed corn and do me!
- Okay, how about tomorrow night?
Yeah, I've heard that before, and then tomorrow comes, and you're too tired.
Okay, then, this weekend.
I'll be all yours.
And we can defile any piece of furniture you want.
Hey, Karen, you don't have any fax paper, do you?
Fax paper!
Turn down the Dean Martin!
Don't worry about it.
I'll go to the store tomorrow.
Do you need anything?
Eggs...
Milk...
Lightbulbs...
Okay, let's make this easier.
Is there anything you don't need?
I'll tell you what.
I'll call you from the store in the morning, okay?
What a lovely rainbow, June.
Here's a gold star for you.
Oh, Drew, wow!
You know, elephants don't have wings, but I like the way you're thinking.
Hey, Evan, what did you draw?
Oh.
Um...
That's a lot of red.
It's blood.
Okay.
So...
That man must be a doctor making the bloody man all better?
No, he's stabbing him in the guts with a sword.
Evan, that's... kind of a scary picture.
Nuh-unh, it's funny.
No, Honey, it's inappropriate, especially when the assignment was to make a picture that makes you happy.
This does make me happy.
Where's my gold star?
I just can't get used to everyone working--
First Bree, then Susan, now Lynette.
Thank God for you.
I just had to get out of that boring house.
So what do you gals do when you get together?
Mostly gossip.
Mm.
- You got any good gossip?
Ooh.
I heard Ed Simmons got a Harley.
You know, I should get back.
Come on.
Give me a break.
I'm still new at this.
Okay.
We'll start with something a little easier--bitching.
I can handle that.
Bitch away.
Well, I am so pissed at Carlos.
He is never home.
And when he is, he's too tired to do anything.
And by "anything," I mean sex.
Are you uncomfortable?
A little.
Go on.
Well, we've never had a drought like this.
It's been almost two weeks.
Two weeks?
And that's a drought for you?
Yeah.
Lately, Carlos just doesn't want to do it.
Wrong.
Guys always wanna do it.
Really?
- Yeah.
Even if you're tired and get home late?
Even if we're exhausted and late and been shot in the leg...
twice.
We still want to.
So you just gotta get past the tired adult to find the horny teenage boy inside.
Huh.
That's good to know.
You're good at this girl talk thing.
Well, thanks.
So, um, does Lynette ever talk about me and sex?
Yeah, I should get back.
You called me down here for this?
It's a kid playing with a soccer ball.
It's a head, and he's stabbing someone with a sword.
Well, maybe it was in self-defense.
Mr. Mayer, generally, when kids exhibit this type of behavior, there's a problem.
Excuse me.
I have to take this.
Sorry.
Hello?
Thanks for ratting out my kid on his first day.
It's not my fault.
I showed this to the school psychologist.
She gave it to the principal.
My hands were tied.
So right away it's Evan's fault?
Did you ever consider that he didn't understand the assignment?
I told the class to draw something that made them happy.
All the other kids drew kittens and rainbows.
Your son drew small intestines on the end of a stick.
Let's cut to what this is really about.
You hate me, and you don't want my son in your class.
That is not true!
- It is, too!
You're still punishing me for what happened between us.
You're stuck in the past and blaming me for your screwed-up life!
- Okay, will someone call Guinness?
Because you just set the world record for the biggest load of crap in one sentence.
Oh, bite me!
How long was I gone?
Uh...
This is nothing, Mr. Hobson.
We were just having a difference of opinion.
Yeah, and my opinion is your teacher doesn't understand the difference between emotional problems and creativity.
Shut up, Karl.
Excuse me.
Did you just tell him to shut up?
You know, this is typical "Susan" behavior.
And you wonder why no man can stay with you.
Would this seem any less shocking if I told you we were once married for 12 years?
Yes, am I speaking to Mr. Dinsmore?
Ah, this is Bree Van de Kamp.
Yes, it's nice to talk to you, too.
Well, as I'm sure you're aware, your company has made several offers to purchase mine.
Yes, I know I said I wasn't interested, but some things have happened in my personal life and I think I'm ready to... finally make a deal.
Really?
Well, that's wonderful.
Why don't you, uh, come to my office tomorrow and we'll talk?
Goodye, Mr. Dinsmore.
Ok, there you go.
The rest is yours.
Thanks.
I don't know what it is.
Every time I go to the market, there's stuff I forget.
I know what it is.
You're old.
So where's Dave?
- Camping.
Ooh, camping.
How fun.
Enjoying the great outdoors, getting a bunch of teenage kids on prom weekend.
Good for him.
Look, I know that you think he's some creepy psycho.
But you should know that he has had a very hard life, and there are things about him that you don't understand.
Like what?
Like he was married before, and his wife died in an accident along with their 3-year-old daughter.
Oh, Edie.
Are you sure?
Yes.
So if at times his behavior seems a little strange, try to remember the grief he's carrying.
You know, I lost a kid.
It does things to you.
No wonder he...
Oh, God, I wish I'd known.
Well, you do now.
So next time, try to be a little more understanding.
Of course.
You know, I could use a drink.
Come to my house and we'll crank up Dean Martin and... toss a few back.
Come on.
Mom?
Oh, Andrew.
I didn't hear you come in.
That Dinsmore guy is waiting for you downstairs.
Thank you, dear.
I must say, Bree.
I was surprised to get your call.
You've always said you'd never sell your company.
Bree has decided she wants more family time.
She's a very traditional woman, you know.
It's one of the reasons I fell in love with her.
Does that mean you're going to stop working altogether?
I know your fans have been hoping for a second book, uh, my wife included.
That's sweet, but I've decided to focus on other pursuits at the moment.
Mm, yes, her sole ambition now is to be Mrs. Orson Hodge.
And at the risk of sounding selfish,
I'm glad I'll be the only one she's cooking for.
Were you able to look over the contracts I sent over?
Oh, shoot.
I left them upstairs.
Oh.
Well, I'll get them.
I'll show you the offices before we start the demolition.
You're getting rid of your office?
No, we don't need it anymore, and Bree knows I've always wanted a game room.
So it's your "sole ambition" to be Mrs. Orson Hodge?
Andrew.
No, I-I have to ask.
Why are you letting Orson sell your company?
It was my idea.
My work has been compromising my marriage.
I didn't realize the toll it's been taking on Orson.
Okay, so he's unhappy.
Buy him some golf clubs, put him on lithium, but don't give up everything you've worked so hard for.
Andrew, do you know why my book sold so well?
Because it was authentic.
I actually believe in the old-fashioned values I wrote about.
I believe in men opening doors for ladies and children respecting their elders.
I also believe that sometimes women need to make sacrifices for their husbands.
I would be the worst kind of hypoite if I preached these values and then didn't follow them myself.
Okay, I get it.
You love Orson, and you're willing to sell your company to prove it.
What I'm wondering is, is if he loves you, why would he want you to stop doing what makes you happy?
Hey.
You busy?
What is it?
I brought you a little gift.
Oh.
Cute.
I thought it would be a nice addition to your collection.
Uh-huh.
I knew it was you.
Pardon?
You're the one who complained about me to Carlos.
I'm... not sure what you're talking about.
Oh, jeez.
What, you knife me in the back, and now you're gonna play stupid?
Carlos said some people are having problems with me and that I should watch my demeanor.
And I thought to myself, who are "some people"?
And then it hit me-- it's the chummy neighbor.
Okay, yes, Carlos and I spoke briefly, but I thought he blew me off.
- So that's your defense?
You thought your backstabbing was unsuccessful?
Well, I'll admit it's kind of flimsy, but until I got something better...
Okay, next time you have an issue with me, you know where my office is.
Oh, and, uh, as far as Friday nights are concerned... consider that a permanent work night.
Don't worry.
If you're as bad at coaching as you are at office politics, your daughter won't be missing much.
Found the contract.
Everything is in order.
All we need now is your signature.
- Mr. Dimore, would you mind if I speak to my husband for a moment?
Oh, yeah, please, go ahead.
I'll--I'll be right outside.
What's wrong?
This is happening so fast.
Yes, a bit.
But it was your idea.
Well, I have a new idea.
I'd like to wait.
Wait?
But I-I need this for my recovery.
Just give me one year.
That's not asking too much, is it?
You made me a promise.
You need to stick to it.
Orson, think about how I built this company from nothing, how it brings me joy and pride and a sense of accomplishment.
Is that really something you want me to give up?
Yes.
Mr. Dinsmore, would you come back in, please?
So are we ready?
Actually, no.
I'm not selling.
Excuse me?
Tell your wife
I will be doing that second book after all.
Well, I'm--I'm sorry to hear that.
Bree...
What about my problem?
I might start stealing again.
Steal what you must, my love.
But it won't be my company.
Look at him.
He's out like a light already.
That's what a long day of fishing does to you.
Yeah, well, he's gonna need all of his energy for our big hike tomorrow, right?
Actually, I don't think I'm gonna go with you guys.
My knee's been kind of bothering me.
Okay, well, then why don't we wait till the next day and see how you feel?
No, no, it's fine.
I'm just gonna hang out here.
Besides, it's such a romantic hike.
You guys should do it alone.
You always have such a good attitude.
Do I?
- Uh-huh.
It seems like you take everything in stride, you know?
Like you just naturally find the silver lining.
Yeah, I wish it were natural.
I had to teach myself to be this way.
With some of the stuff that's happened to me,
I never would've survived if I hadn't.
So what's your secret?
Oh, I realized that...
I was waiting for somebody to fix things.
But no one was going to.
It was all up to me.
I had to decide what was important
And go after it.
I had to make myself happy.
Are you?
Happy.
I'm gettin' there.
Why don't you get some sleep?
You got a big day tomorrow.
Come on, Lucy.
Why would you agree to this meeting?
Well, we're overextended as it is.
Fine.
Yeah, I'll see you at the conference room at 7:00 A.M.
Hi there.
Hey, babe.
What are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep.
I was a little hot.
That's better.
You look a little warm yourself.
Okay, I know where you're going with this.
Oh, if that were true, your pants would be around your ankles right now.
Gaby what are you doing?
I'm releasing the horny teen inside of you.
Now come on.
Two boobs, no waiting.
- Damn it, Gaby,
I thought we were gonna wait till the weekend.
I'm tired.
Not my problem.
Actually, it is!
You know, if big Carlos is tired, that pretty much rules out little Carlos, too.
Now listen up, the pair of you.
I haven't been sitting around in butt floss all night for my health.
You're putting out.
Oh!
Ahh!
That's more like it!
Well, I'm awake now.
In fact... mind if we spice it up a bit?
I forgot these were in the nightstand.
This is gonna be fun.
Mm-hmm.
There.
How's that?
Tight, just the way I like it.
- Me, too.
Mmm.
Good night.
Carlos, where you going?
To go grab a few hours sleep before I have to get back to work.
Carlos, get back here!
Carlos!
Could you at least scratch my nose?
!
Amy, that is very sweet.
I love the colors you used.
Oh, Danielle, that is just beautiful.
Hmm.
Oh.
Evan, that is very pretty.
You did the assignment just like I asked.
Good job!
That's not mine.
Annie asked me to bring hers up for her.
This one's mine.
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
- Oh!
Don't wake him up.
I know.
Ow!
- Come on.
I know.
What is that?
- Let's just go back.
Let's go back.
I heard a gunshot.
It sounded like a hunting rifle.
Yeah, it almost hit Katherine.
- You guys all right?
Yeah, I think so.
Hey, this is a State Park.
People aren't supposed to be hunting here.
Well, I guess these guys don't care about that.
I just wanna get out of here.
Please?
- Yeah, of course.
We'll, uh, go back and pack, and we'll leave.
Well, sorry, man.
Me, too.
Juanita!
Celia!
Get your coats on!
We're going to see daddy.
Let me see it.
- Okay, just so you know,
I should be bringing this to the psychologist.
But I didn't, because this kind of "self-expression"
usually gets kids expelled.
- Just let me see it.
Aw, hell.
Yeah, "aw, hell."
You got a problem here, Karl.
Your son's got some serious anger issues, and you need to figure out what's going on.
I know what's going on.
This is his mom.
Marisa?
Well, why would he draw a picture of her like this?
She left us...
Six weeks ago.
Oh.
Karl...
I woke up one day to find her standing there with her bags packed.
She said she was overwhelmed, that she loved Evan but she wasn't cut out to be a mother.
So she just left?
So here I am, alone, raising this boy.
And it's obvious I'm not doing a very good job.
You must be loving this.
Why?
'Cause I did the exact same thing to you.
Oh.
Yeah.
You know, I can understand why you react the way you do when you bump into me, why it bothers you.
I never really got it until just now.
I used to hope that one day, you would know what this felt like, and now that you do...
I'm so sorry.
Oh!
Hey, Lynette!
- Hi!
Great office.
I see you're busy.
Don't let me disturb you.
I just wanted to drop off the girls so I could talk to Carlos for a sec.
All right, girls, have fun with Aunt Lynette.
You think you can buy me off with presents?
Gaby, now is not a good time.
Well, I'd say let's talk about it tonight, but who knows if you're even gonna come home?
Damn it, Gaby.
You're the one that pushed me take this job.
And ever since I did, all you've done is complain about how hard I'm working.
You're right, and I'm sorry.
It's just...
I'm scared.
We're turning into what we used to be.
I'm unhappy at home, you're always working, trying to buy me off with presents, too tired to make me feel loved.
We've made these mistakes before, Carlos.
For God sakes, let's not make 'em again.
I made a commitment here, Gaby.
I don't think I can just bail.
I know you can't, and that's the part that really scares me.
We're bored.
Hey, I got you sodas, didn't I?
And I let you feed the paper shredder.
Don't you have any toys?
- No.
I got a hole puncher.
Sorry.
That's the best I could do.
Come on.
What about those glass things?
They're pretty.
Can I hold one?
Oh, sweetie, those aren't to play with, not unless you wanna see someone go completely bonkers.
Actually, they do look like a lot of fun.
If only I had the power to stop you...
What the hell are you doing?
!
We're playing.
What does it look like?
Are these your kids?
'Cause they were in my office playing with my figurines, which are imported.
They're worth a lot of dinero.
Do you even understand what I'm saying?
!
What's with the yelling?
I don't know.
I'm just as worried as you are.
Look, let me boil it down for you.
Office?
Sí.
Day care?
No!
Lucy, what's going on?
Apparently, some people don't understand that this is a place of business, and they need to keep their kids at home!
Then I guess you should yell at me.
These are my kids.
Come here, sweetie.
Oh, jeez.
I, uh, I didn't know that.
I-I thought they were hers 'cause they're...
Could you just go?
Um...
I'm sorry.
So what if they were?
That's the way you talk to people?
- I said I'm sorry.
Look, I-I am trying so hard to make this deal happen.
I guess the stress is just getting to me.
It's getting all of us.
Maybe it's a sign we should change the way we do things around here.
We are trying to play with the big boys, Carlos.
Now is not the time to pull back.
Don't you want this company to succeed?
I wanna build a company that treats its people well and lets them go home at night to see their families.
Look, I know I don't have the greatest bed side manner.
But you hired me to take this company to number one.
Now if you don't want to do that,
I'm probably not your girl.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Wow.
What happened to you?
The old Carlos would do anything to be the best.
I guess I'm not the old Carlos anymore.
Fine.
Don't forget your little animals!
Orson, please come upstairs.
I know what that couch does to your back.
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.
Know you're disappointed right now, but you have to know,
I really do want to find some way for you to be happy.
So do I.
Hey, don't you want your stuff?
Oh, can I get it tomorrow?
I just really want to get home.
Edie?
I always wondered why you were so determined to live on Wisteria Lane.
You said you thought we'd be happy here, and I wanted to believe you.
But it turned out that you... just wanted to be close to Mike Delfino.
Who gave you that?
Nobody gave it to me.
I did research.
You think I'm too stupid to do research?
Edie, listen.
This doesn't mean anything.
It's all there--the accident, Mike's acquittal, and even a little mention of how...
David Dash couldn't make it to the funeral because he had a nervous breakdown.
Honey, look.
Just give me a chance to explain.
Oh, so now you want to explain?
Okay, why don't you start by explaining why you married me?
I married you because I love you.
No!
You married me because you needed a cover story so you could get close to the man who killed your family.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah, it's insane.
But that's why you did it.
So what are you gonna do now?
You gonna hurt him?
I mean...
You know, that's the only.
Logical explanation.
And my only question is...
What the hell have you been waiting for?
Honey, you're not feeling well.
Let's get you upstairs into bed.
Tell me the truth, you freak.
Did you move us here to hurt Mike Delfino?
He destroyed... everything I ever loved, and he was never punished.
I need to make things right.
You?
Why did you have to do this?
We could've been so happy.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna tell him before you...
Before you do something stupid.
- Edie, don't.
Give me that.
No!
Aah!
Get out of here!
Just get the hell out!
I'm calling the police!
Do you hear me?
Aah!
Aah!
Yes, life is full of nasty shocks.
And they always seem to occur when we least expect them.
And once our system has been jolted, the question becomes, will we survive?

A thief was confronted.
Maybe you'd feel comfortable talking to a professional.
A psychiatrist?
Someone light me a cigar.
Carlos hired an old girlfriend, and Gabby hired a spy.
I talked to Carlos.
You're in.
Edie dug deeper into Dave's past.
Killed three years ago, car crash.
That was his wife.
Give me that one.
Their daughter died in the same crash.
And Dave's master plan...
You really think I've made that much of a difference in Mike's life?
If he ever lost you, it would destroy him.
...entered its final phase.
Hi.
Is this the ranger station?
I didn't know whether to call you or Fish and Game, but I think I saw some guys up at Emerson Woods hunting illegally, and I got worried because I know people like to go camping up there
and I sure wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.
Oh, no, no need to thank me.
I'm just doing my part as a concerned citizen.
Bye now.
Dave Williams had been planning the murder for years.
And like all the best plans, it was a simple one.
First, he would guide Mike Delfino and Katherine Mayfair to a remote cabin.
The next morning, he'd pretend to be asleep as the two lovers left to go hiking.
Dave would then grab the gun he'd carefully hidden and start to follow his quarry.
He'd wait until the two had paused for a moment to catch their breaths, and then he'd pull the trigger breaking the heart of the man who had killed his wife.
When the rangers arrived, they would mention the reports of illegal hunters in the area.
And Dave would drive Mike back home, all the while enjoying his pain.
Yes, Dave Williams had come up with a very simple plan.
But as he was about to discover...
Have you faxed this clipping to Edie Williams yet?
I'm doing it right now.
...there is nothing simple about murder.
Life is full of nasty shocks.
Unpleasant surprises that jolt our systems.
And cause our hearts to skip a beat.
And these shocks always occur...
- Susan?
- Hey, Karl.
...when we least expect them.
Karl, what are you doing here?
- Well, I just enrolled Evan.
- Wow.
And I was worried that we'd be out of each other's lives forever.
Lucky, lucky.
- What are you doing here?
- I am an art teacher.
Really?
Do they know that?
And now I'm ignoring you and moving on to Evan.
- Hello, Evan.
- Evan, this is Susan.
She's your sister Julie's mother.
We used to be married.
She was a lot younger then.
Evan, why don't you head into the classroom?
I need to talk to your daddy and I may need to use some grown-up words.
Okay, Suzie Q, what's wrong?
Get it off that chest you wouldn't let me enhance.
Listen, it's bad enough that I've got one ex-husband running around the halls.
I don't need the faculty and the parents knowing that I have two.
So not a word about us having been married.
No more wisecracks, no "Suzie Qs." I am Miss Susan, art teacher.
Yes, Miss Susan.
Can I bang your erasers after class?
Karl, I'm serious.
Don't mess with me.
I have a yardstick and I'm not afraid to use it.
We're going to be making a presentation for the Morrison contract sooner than we'd planned.
There are a lot of firms gunning for this and...
Damn it!
Lynette, don't...
Don't touch my figurines.
These are worth more than the house you live in.
Big deal.
So is this coffee mug.
All right.
We should break for lunch.
No.
Until this deal closes, we work through lunch.
But as a consolation, we'll also be working nights.
Nights?
You really think that's necessary?
This is a 10-million-dollar deal, Carlos.
How bad do you want it?
You heard the woman.
We're working nights.
I have a tiny scheduling conflict.
I coach my daughter's basketball team on Friday nights.
- So if I could...
- Friday nights are now work nights.
If we're successful, those of you on commission stand to do very well.
And those of you who aren't, well, you get to keep your jobs, which, in this economy, is a bonus all by itself.
All right, let's run down to the deli, grab a sandwich and meet back here in five.
You.
No touching.
And yes, I'll know.
Isn't she fun?
Hey, Carlos, did I ever tell you that Tom and I seriously considered you and Gabby for Penny's godparents?
You're not getting Friday nights off.
Look, I'm not happy about the schedule either.
- I'm missing my kids, too.
- Then do something about it.
You're the president.
Put the brakes on Lucy.
Lynette, I hired her to crack the whip, and that's what she's doing.
It's good for the company.
But she makes people crazy.
Can't you talk to her?
Get her to dial it down a bit?
I will think about it.
But don't be asking me for favors like this.
When we're at the office, I'm not your neighbor,
I'm not your friend.
I'm your boss.
Got it?
By the way, you and Tom are coming over for cocktails on Saturday?
Oh, yeah.
I plan to get drunk and bitch about my boss.
I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.
Do you at least know why he steals?
If there were some sordid childhood trauma we could blame it on, it would really help me out with the neighbors.
Oh, he knows.
Dr. Bernstein uncovered that my very first session.
Really?
And yet he keeps charging me.
So doctor, what's this revelation that you've been keeping from me for $200 an hour?
I steal to hurt you.
Why would you want to hurt me?
Each day for the past year, you have inch by inch, slice by slice, brought me closer to being a eunuch.
Would you excuse us for a moment?
This just became a private conversation.
If I stay, I might be able to help.
You want to help?
Why don't you go down to the pharmacy in the lobby and buy some Aspirin.
I'm going to need it.
I don't deserve this.
I have been nothing but supportive of you since you got out of jail.
I even gave you a job.
I wanted to be your partner.
You made me an employee.
So you decided to punish me by resorting to petty theft?
- For God's sake, Orson.
I'm your wife.
- Perhaps.
But I'm not your husband.
We may share a bed, but you save your passion for your company.
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?
Every day for the past year,
I have been in the background, an afterthought.
While you spend day and night nurturing your business.
All the while thinking I had your support.
I tried.
I thought I wouldn't mind being Mr. Bree Van De Kamp, but it's killing me.
Every day, I get smaller and smaller.
And if something doesn't change,
Orson Hodge is just going to disappear altogether.
Girls are out like a light.
Thanks for dinner.
Carlos, do you have to go back to work?
- Gabby, I've got a meeting.
- Well, can't Lucy cover it?
You know those two extra zeros at the end of my paycheck you like so much?
They're there because I'm President.
Hours are part of the gig.
- Hey, how about a quickie?
- Babe, I don't have time.
Right.
That's why I didn't suggest a longie.
Oh, come on.
I'll have your eyes rolling back in your head in three minutes flat.
You want to do it there?
In front of the kids' sippy cups?
All gone.
Now let's do this.
It'll be like old times.
- We never did it on the table.
- Yeah, we did.
Years ago.
Don't you remember?
I don't think that was me.
Oh, right.
Well, we'll create new table memories.
If you're trying to turn me on, you just failed miserably.
Carlos, do you realize since Bradley died and you took over, we haven't had sex once?
I miss you.
I want to spend time with you.
Now move the creamed corn and do me!
- Okay, how about tomorrow night?
- Yeah, I heard that before.
And then tomorrow comes and you're too tired.
Okay then, this weekend.
I'll be all yours.
We can defile any piece of furniture you want.
Hey, Karen.
You don't have any fax paper, do you?
Fax paper!
Turn down the Dean Martin!
Don't worry about it.
I'll go to the store tomorrow.
Do you need anything?
Eggs, milk, light bulbs...
Okay, let's make this easier.
Is there anything you don't need?
I'll tell you what, I'll call you from the store in the morning, okay?
What a lovely rainbow, June.
Here's a gold star for you.
Oh, Drew, wow!
You know, elephants don't have wings.
But I like the way you're thinking.
Hey, Evan, what'd you draw?
Oh, that's a lot of red.
- It's blood.
- Okay.
So that man must be a doctor, making the bloody man all better?
No, he's stabbing him in the guts with a sword.
Evan, that's kind of a scary picture.
- Uh-uh.
It's funny.
- No, honey, it's inappropriate.
Especially when the assignment was to make a picture that makes you happy.
This does make me happy.
Where's my gold star?
I just can't get used to everyone working.
First Bree, then Susan, now Lynette.
Thank God for you.
I just had to get out of that boring house.
So, what do you gals do when you get together?
Mostly gossip.
You got any good gossip?
Ooh, I heard Ed Simmons got a Harley.
You know, I should get back.
Come on.
Give me a break.
I'm still new at this.
Okay.
We'll start with something a little easier.
Bitching.
I can handle that.
Bitch away.
Well, I am so pissed at Carlos.
He is never home.
And when he is, he's too tired to do anything.
And by anything, I mean sex.
- Are you uncomfortable?
- A little.
Go on.
Well, we've never had a drought like this.
It's been almost two weeks.
Two weeks?
And that's a drought for you?
Yeah.
Lately, Carlos just doesn't want to do it.
Wrong.
Guys always want to do it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Even if you're tired and get home late?
Even if we're exhausted, and late, and been shot in the leg, twice.
We still want to.
So you've just got to get past the tired adult to find the horny teenage boy inside.
Huh.
That's good to know.
You're good at this girl talk thing.
Well, thanks.
So, does Lynette ever talk about me and sex?
Yeah, I should get back.
You called me down here for this?
It's a kid playing with a soccer ball.
It's a head.
And he's stabbing someone with a sword.
Well, maybe it was in self-defense.
Mr. Mayer, generally when kids exhibit this type of behavior, there's a problem.
Excuse me, I have to take this.
Sorry.
Hello?
Thanks for ratting out my kid on his first day.
It's not my fault.
I showed this to the school psychologist, she gave it to the principal.
My hands were tied.
So right away it's Evan's fault?
Did you ever consider that he didn't understand the assignment?
I told the class to draw something that made them happy.
All the other kids drew kittens and rainbows.
Your son drew small intestines on the end of a stick.
Let's cut to what this is really about.
You hate me and you don't want my son in your class.
- That is not true!
- It is, too!
You're still punishing me for what happened between us!
You're stuck in the past and blaming me for your screwed-up life!
Okay, will someone call Guinness because you just set the world record for the biggest load of crap in one sentence!
Oh, bite me!
How long was I gone?
Uh, this is nothing, Mr. Hobson.
We were just having a difference of opinion.
Yeah, and my opinion is your teacher doesn't understand the difference between emotional problems and creativity.
Shut up, Karl.
Excuse me, did you just tell him to shut up?
You know, this is typical "Susan" behavior.
And you wonder why no man can stay with you.
Would this seem any less shocking if I told you we were once married for 12 years?
Yes, am I speaking to Mr. Dinsmore?
This is Bree Van De Kamp.
Yes, it's nice to talk to you, too.
As I'm sure you're aware, your company has made several offers to purchase mine.
Yes, I know I said I wasn't interested.
But some things have happened in my personal life and I think I'm ready to finally make a deal.
Really?
Well, that's wonderful.
Why don't you come to my office tomorrow and we'll talk.
Goodbye, Mr. Dinsmore.
- Here you go.
The rest is yours.
- Thanks.
I don't know what it is.
Every time I go to the market, there's stuff I forget.
I know what it is.
You're old.
- So where's Dave?
- Camping.
Camping?
How fun.
Enjoying the great outdoors, gutting a bunch of teenage kids on prom weekend.
Good for him.
Look, I know that you think he's some creepy psycho, but you should know that he has had a very hard life.
And there are things about him that you don't understand.
- Like what?
- Like he was married before.
And his wife died in an accident, along with their 3-year-old daughter.
- Oh, Edie, are you sure?
- Yes.
So, if at times his behavior seems a little strange, try to remember the grief he's carrying.
You know, I lost a kid.
It does things to you.
No wonder he...
- Oh, God, I wish I'd known.
- Well, you do now.
So next time, try to be a little more understanding.
Of course.
You know, I could use a drink.
Come to my house and we'll crank up Dean Martin and toss a few back.
Come on.
Mom?
Oh, Andrew.
I didn't hear you come in.
That Dinsmore guy is waiting for you downstairs.
Thank you, dear.
I must say, Bree, I was surprised to get your call.
You've always said you'd never sell your company.
Well, Bree's decided she wants more family time.
She's a very traditional woman, you know.
It's one of the reasons I fell in love with her.
Does that mean that you're going to stop working altogether?
I know your fans have been hoping for a second book.
My wife included.
That's sweet.
But I've decided to focus on other pursuits at the moment.
Yes, her sole ambition now is to be Mrs. Orson Hodge.
And, at the risk of sounding selfish,
I'm glad I'll be the only one she's cooking for.
Were you able to look over the contracts I sent over?
- Oh, shoot, I left them upstairs.
- Oh, I'll get them.
I'll show you the offices before we start the demolition.
- You're getting rid of your office?
- Yeah, we don't need it anymore.
And Bree knows I've always wanted a game room.
So, it's your "sole ambition to be Mrs. Orson Hodge"?
- Andrew...
- No, I...
I have to ask.
Why are you letting Orson sell your company?
It was my idea.
My work has been compromising my marriage.
I didn't realize the toll it's been taking on Orson.
Okay, so he's unhappy.
Buy him some golf clubs, put him on lithium.
But don't give up everything you've worked so hard for.
Andrew, do you know why my book sold so well?
Because it was authentic.
I actually believe in the old-fashioned values I wrote about.
I believe in men opening doors for ladies and children respecting their elders.
I also believe that sometimes women need to make sacrifices for their husbands.
I would be the worst kind of hypocrite if I preached these values and then didn't follow them myself.
Okay.
I get it.
You love Orson, and you're willing to sell your company to prove it.
What I'm wondering is, is if he loves you, why would he want you to stop doing what makes you happy?
- Hey, you busy?
- What is it?
I brought you a little gift.
Oh.
Cute.
I thought it would be a nice addition to your collection.
Uh-huh.
- I knew it was you.
- Pardon?
You're the one who complained about me to Carlos.
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Oh, geez.
You knife me in the back and now you're going to play stupid?
Carlos said some people were having problems with me and that I should watch my demeanor, and I thought to myself, "Who are 'some people?"'
And then it hit me.
It's the chummy neighbor.
Okay, yes.
Carlos and I spoke briefly.
But I thought he blew me off.
So, that's your defense?
You thought your back-stabbing was unsuccessful?
Well, I'll admit it's kind of flimsy, but until I've got something better...
Okay.
Next time you have an issue with me, you know where my office is.
Oh, and as far as Friday nights are concerned?
Consider that a permanent work night.
Don't worry, if you're as bad at coaching as you are at office politics, your daughter won't be missing much.
Found the contract.
Everything is in order.
All we need now is your signature.
Mr. Dinsmore, would you mind if I speak to my husband for a moment?
Oh, yeah, please go ahead.
I'll...
I'll be right outside.
What's wrong?
This is happening so fast.
Yes, a bit.
But it was your idea.
Well, I have a new idea.
I'd like to wait.
Wait?
- I...
I need this for my recovery.
- Just give me one year.
That's not asking too much, is it?
You made me a promise.
You need to stick to it.
Orson, think about how I built this company from nothing.
How it brings me joy and pride and a sense of accomplishment.
Is that really something you want me to give up?
Yes.
Mr. Dinsmore, would you come back in, please?
So, are we ready?
Actually, no.
I'm not selling.
Excuse me?
Tell your wife I will be doing that second book after all.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry to hear that.
Bree, what about my problem?
I might start stealing again.
Steal what you must, my love.
But it won't be my company.
Look at him.
He's out like a light already.
That's what a long day of fishing does to you.
Yeah, well, he's going to need all of his energy for our big hike tomorrow, right?
Actually, I don't think I'm going to go with you guys.
My knee's been kind of bothering me.
Okay, well, then why don't we wait until the next day and see how you feel?
No, no, no, it's fine.
I'm just going to hang out here.
Besides, it's such a romantic hike.
You guys should do it alone.
You always have such a good attitude.
- Do I?
- Uh-huh.
It seems like you take everything in stride, you know?
Like you just naturally find the silver lining.
Yeah, I wish it were natural.
I had to teach myself to be this way.
With some of the stuff that's happened to me,
I never would have survived if I hadn't.
So what's your secret?
Well, I realized that I was waiting for somebody to fix things.
But no one was going to.
It was all up to me.
I had to decide what was important, and go after it.
I had to make myself happy.
Are you happy?
I'm getting there.
Why don't you get some sleep?
You've got a big day tomorrow.
Come on, Lucy, why would you agree to this meeting?
Well, we're overextended as it is.
Fine.
I'll see you at the conference room at 7:00 a.m.
Hi, there.
Hey, babe.
What are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep.
I was a little hot.
That's better.
You look a little warm yourself.
Okay, I know where you're going with this.
If that were true, your pants would be around your ankles right now.
Gabby, what are you doing?
I'm releasing the horny teen inside of you!
Now, come on.
- Two boobs, no waiting.
- Damn it, Gabby!
I thought we were going to wait until the weekend.
I'm tired.
Not my problem.
Actually, it is.
You know, if big Carlos is tired, that pretty much rules out little Carlos, too.
Now listen up, the pair of you.
I haven't been sitting around in butt floss all night for my health.
You're putting out.
- That's more like it.
- Well, I'm awake now.
In fact, mind if we spice it up a bit?
I forgot these were in the nightstand.
This is going to be fun.
- There.
How's that?
- Tight.
Just the way I like it.
Me, too.
Mmm.
Goodnight.
Carlos!
Where are you going?
To go grab a few hours sleep before I have to get back to work.
Carlos, get back here!
Carlos!
Could you at least scratch my nose?
Amy, that is very sweet.
Oh, I love the colors you used.
Oh, Danielle, that is just beautiful.
Oh.
Evan, that is very pretty.
Oh, you did the assignment just like I asked.
Good job!
That's not mine.
Annie asked me to bring hers up for her.
This one's mine.
- Don't wake him up.
- I know.
Come on.
- What is that?
- Let's just go back this way.
I heard a gunshot.
It sounded like a hunting rifle.
Yeah, it almost hit Katherine.
- You guys are all right?
- Yeah.
I think so.
Hey, this is a state park.
People aren't supposed to be hunting here.
Well, I guess these guys don't care about that.
- I just want to get out of here.
Please?
- Yeah, of course.
We'll go back and pack, then we'll leave.
Sorry, man.
Me, too.
Juanita!
Celia!
Get your coats on!
We're going to see Daddy!
Let me see it.
Okay, just so you know, I should be bringing this to the psychologist.
But I didn't.
Because this kind of self-expression usually gets a kid expelled.
Just let me see it.
- Oh, hell.
- Yeah, "Oh, hell."
You've got a problem here, Karl.
Your son's got some serious anger issues, and you need to figure out what's going on.
I know what's going on.
This is his mom.
Marisa?
Well, why would he draw a picture of her like this?
She left us.
Six weeks ago.
Oh, Karl...
I woke up one day to find her standing there with her bags packed.
She said she was overwhelmed.
That she loved Evan, but she wasn't cut out to be a mother.
So, she just left?
So, here I am, alone, raising this boy.
And it's obvious I'm not doing a very good job.
You must be loving this.
Why?
Because I did the exact same thing to you.
Oh, yeah.
You know, I can understand why you react the way you do when you bump into me.
Why it bothers you.
I never really got it until just now.
I used to hope that one day you would know what this felt like.
And now that you do,
I'm so sorry.
- Hey, Lynette!
Great office.
- Hi.
I see you're busy, don't let me disturb you.
I just wanted to drop off the girls so I could talk to Carlos for a sec.
All right, girls, have fun with Aunt Lynette.
You think you can buy me off with presents?
Gabby, now is not a good time.
Well, I'd say let's talk about it tonight, but who knows if you're even going to come home.
Damn it, Gabby.
You're the one that pushed me to take this job.
And ever since I did, all you've done is complain about how hard I'm working!
You're right.
And I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm scared.
We're turning into what we used to be.
I'm unhappy at home, you're always working, trying to buy me off with presents, too tired to make me feel loved.
We've made these mistakes before, Carlos.
For God sakes, let's not make them again.
I made a commitment here, Gabby.
I don't think I can just bail.
I know you can't.
And that's the part that really scares me.
We're bored.
Hey, I got you sodas, didn't I?
And I let you feed the paper shredder.
- Don't you have any toys?
- No.
I've got a hole-puncher.
Sorry, that's the best I could do.
Come on.
What about those glass things?
- They're pretty.
Can I hold one?
- Oh, sweetie.
Those aren't to play with.
Not unless you want to see someone go completely bonkers.
Actually, they do look like a lot of fun.
If only I had the power to stop you.
- What the hell are you doing?
- We're playing.
What does it look like?
Are these your kids?
Because they were in my office playing with my figurines!
Which are imported!
They're worth a lot of dinero!
Are...
Do you even understand what I'm saying?
- What's with the yelling?
- I don't know.
I'm just as worried as you are.
Look, let me boil it down for you.
Office, sí.
Daycare, no!
Lucy, what's going on?
Apparently some people don't understand that this is a place of business and they need to keep their kids at home.
Then I guess you should yell at me.
These are my kids.
Come here, sweetie.
I...
I didn't know that.
I...
I thought they were hers because they...
Could you just go?
I'm sorry.
So what if they were?
- That's the way you talk to people?
- I said I'm sorry.
Look, I...
I am trying so hard to make this deal happen,
- I guess the stress is just getting to me.
- It's getting to all of us.
Maybe it's a sign we should change the way we do things around here.
We're trying to play with the big boys, Carlos.
Now is not the time to pull back.
Don't you want this company to succeed?
I want to build a company that treats its people well and lets them go home at night to see their families.
Look, I know I don't have the greatest bedside manner.
But you hired me to take this company to number one.
Now if you don't want to do that, I'm probably not your girl.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Wow.
What happened to you?
The old Carlos would do anything to be the best.
I guess I'm not the old Carlos anymore.
Fine.
Don't forget your little animals.
Orson, please come upstairs.
I know what that couch does to your back.
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.
I know you're disappointed right now.
But you have to know, I really do want to find some way for you to be happy.
So do I.
Hey, don't you want your stuff?
Oh, can I get it tomorrow?
I just really want to get home.
Edie?
I always wondered why you were so determined to live on Wisteria Lane.
You said you thought we'd be happy here, and I wanted to believe you.
But it turned out that you just wanted to be close to Mike Delfino.
- Who gave you that?
- Nobody gave it to me.
I did research.
You think I'm too stupid to do research?
Edie, listen.
This doesn't mean anything.
It's all there.
The accident.
Mike's acquittal.
And even a little mention of how David Dash couldn't make it to the funeral because he had a nervous breakdown.
Honey, look.
Just give me a chance to explain.
Oh, so now you want to explain.
Okay, why don't you start by explaining why you married me?
I married you because I love you.
No.
You married me because you needed a cover story.
So you could get close to the man who killed your family.
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, it's insane.
But that's why you did it.
So what are you going to do now?
Are you going to hurt him?
I mean, that's the only logical explanation.
And my only question is, what the hell have you been waiting for?
Honey, you're not feeling well.
Let's get you upstairs into bed.
Tell me the truth, you freak!
Did you move us here to hurt Mike Delfino?
He destroyed everything I ever loved.
And he was never punished.
I need to make things right.
Why?
Why did you have to do this?
We could have been so happy.
What are you doing?
I've got to tell him before you...
Before you do something stupid.
Edie, don't.
Give me that.
Give...
No!
Get out of here!
You just get the hell out!
I'm calling the police!
Do you hear me?
Yes, life is full of nasty shocks.
And they always seem to occur when we least expect them.
And once our system has been jolted, the question becomes, will we survive?
Smell that?
That's the smell of new comic books.
They're on me today, boys.
You're paying?
Have you been selling your sperm again?
No, I'm celebrating.
As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
Get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.
Just think.
Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will "boldly go where no man has gone before."
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.
The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb "to go"
suggests that Leonard is mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I'm the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.
He's right.
This is an important achievement, for two reasons.
Number one... and, of course, number two!
Clever!
Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you.
It's mind-blowing.
Excuse me.
Spoiler alert.
I didn't spoil anything.
You told me it's mind-blowing.
So, my mind is going into it pre-blown.
And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
I'm sorry.
Said the Grinch to Christmas.
- Can I talk to you about something?
- What's up?
Remember I went out with Penny, a couple weeks ago?
- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure you remember.
You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
What about it?
The thing is, the date didn't go that well.
Too bad.
I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.
- I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?
'Cause we're going out again tomorrow.
Excuse me, Stuart.
Have you read the new Flash?
Well, I have and it will knock your socks off!
Good luck getting them back on.
This is probably my last shot with Penny and I don't want to screw it up.
Nobody wants that.
So, here's my question:
It's the second date, you think she'll be expecting things to get physical?
Gee...
My initial reaction is "no,"
but let me think about it and get back to you.
So, you'll give me a call?
- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.
Or nobody calls anyone.
Interesting.
Penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
I'm listening.
Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.
Subtitles:
The FW Team
- How's it going?
- Good, good.
You?
Fine.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
You know your friend Stuart?
He asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
About what?
Does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends?
'Cause you know, you and me...
No, that's the past.
I'm really more of a "right now" kind of guy.
You know, living in the moment.
Although I do have to live a little in the future, 'cause that's my job.
Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future.
In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.
Okay, well, that's really cool of you.
I wouldn't say cool.
I'd just say... "That's Leonard!"
In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
About Stuart?
Love to.
He's very shy.
How do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
First of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.
Really?
Stuart thrives under pressure.
That's why he works in a comic book store.
It's Stuart.
You're not going to answer it?
He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't want to talk about Penny.
You're making an assumption.
Perhaps the comic book store is on fire.
And he needs your assistance.
Why would he call me?
We don't know.
And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.
I'm not answering the phone.
Answer the phone, Leonard.
There, it went to voice mail.
Aren't you going to check your messages?
You have to check your messages!
The living of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message.
If that contract breaks down, then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.
It must be hell inside your head.
At times.
Guys, we have a code red.
"Code Red" the hospital emergency alert, the computer worm, or the cherry-flavored soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.
How teeny tiny?
It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.
- But the mission is for six months.
- See, that's the code red.
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.
No one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
Have you notified NASA?
Are you crazy?
What am I gonna say?
"I screwed up your toilet and there's gonna be crap floating
"all over your nice shiny space station"?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.
So, what do you need us for?
He can't figure out how to fix it.
You said you were gonna be supportive.
I'm trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.
I agree.
It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here.
Check your messages.
All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
Good one.
It's hilarious.
Now...
Here's an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station.
We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.
You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?
I have to say,
I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition.
Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.
You busy?
Classified, Leonard.
Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project.
What's up?
Tonight's my date with Penny and since we haven't been able to connect by phone...
I'm sorry, it's been broken.
- Or e-mail.
- Yeah, that too.
Everything's broken.
Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
All right, well, off the top of my head,
I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow.
I mean, glacial.
Guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to set yourself apart.
Be a little shy, don't make too much eye contact.
And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and-and, you know, fear.
- Fear?
- Yeah, like, you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.
Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
Good, good.
You kids have fun tonight.
Thanks, Leonard.
What is that thing anyway?
You don't know what this is?
Good.
Get out.
Be afraid of Penny.
Nice.
Very crafty.
It wasn't bad advice.
It's just wasn't particularly helpful.
For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.
All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC
- to reinforce the center cross-support?
- No good.
It might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there?
This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.
I feel terrible.
Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.
I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.
Of course you feel terrible.
You completely screwed up your karma.
You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?
It's not superstition.
It's practically Newtonian.
For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch.
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.
Speaking of what goes around comes around...
Okay, look.
Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
It won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
What if we reposition the collection tank?
It won't work.
No way to mount it.
Okay, here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?
That could work.
- Morning.
- Morning.
What's up?
Nothing.
We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity... pasta maker.
I'm gonna make a coffee run.
Do you want any?
No, thanks.
I have coffee.
Great.
So how'd it go with Stuart last night?
I really don't want to talk about it.
Yeah.
Right.
Sure.
The thing is, before you guys went out,
I spoke to him and...
I said I don't want to talk about it.
I just...
I kind of...
What goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business.
So just leave it alone, okay?
If you want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin' latte.
Hang on, I think I've got this.
Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.
You're overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you're building.
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.
Howard, wait.
Why don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
Because this is not a spare part from the space station.
This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
That what that's for?
In India, the lid touches the cheese.
Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
- Where are you going?
- Comic book store.
An excellent idea!
I could certainly use a break.
- Me, too.
- You can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
Why does Leonard get to go?
'Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
- I got your back, sister.
All right, I think we've got a prototype ready to test.
Hand me that Tupperware.
That's heavy.
Damn right it's heavy.
It's my mother's meat loaf.
It's been testing toilets for generations.
I must say,
I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree.
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in... three, two, one.
Fascinating.
What do you think the problem is?
Not enough bread crumbs.
Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
- Sure, what's up?
- I gave you bad advice about Penny,
- and I want to apologize.
- No, your advice was great.
- It was?
- Yeah, going slow really worked.
You're kidding.
Never worked for me.
Last night at dinner, I did what you told me.
I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.
Wine?
I didn't say to give her wine.
It doesn't matter, that's where it all went to hell.
During the kissing?
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.
No, everything was good and really hot.
And I said,
"Oh, Penny,"
and right where she was supposed to say, "Oh, Stuart," she said... your name.
That is your name, right?
I'm sorry.
That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.
It beats, "You know I'm a dude, right?"
Yeah, it was pretty bad.
No doubt, no doubt.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Not your fault.
Yeah, how about that?
- See you soon.
- Sure.
Yes, sir, I understand "classified."
We'll keep it all classified;
no one has to know but you and me.
What's classified?
Howard's space toilet.
I'll tell you later.
Well, they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.
I don't see why I have to worry.
My career's not hanging in the balance.
That was a joke.
It's funny, because it's true.
Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
Yeah, I said "Leonard."
Yes, you did, didn't you?
What the hell is that?
Meatloaf.
What was it doing on the ceiling?
That's classified.
Houston, International Space Station.
We have a little situation up here.
We'd like to make an unscheduled space walk.
I.S.S., Houston.
Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?
Houston, we'd all like to step outside for a few minutes.
I.S.S., I'm afraid we can't authorize that.
Houston, this is more of an FYI call.
We are basically out the door.
[SNIFFS]
Smell that?
That's the smell of new comic books.
Oh, yes.
They're on me today, boys.
You're paying?
Have you been selling your sperm again?
No, I'm celebrating.
As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the Internationale Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
Oh, get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.
Just think, thanks to your hard work an international crew of astronauts will boldly go where no man has gone before.
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.
The Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double meaning of "to go" suggest that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.

And you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment.
And, you know, fear.
- Fear?
LEONARD:
Yeah.
Like you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.
Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
Good, good.
Well, you kids have fun tonight.
Thanks, Leonard.
What is that thing anyway?
You don't know what this is?
- No.
- Good, get out.
Be afraid of Penny.
Nice, very crafty.
It wasn't bad advice.
It just wasn't particularly helpful.
For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain we make Jesus cry.
All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the center cross-support?
No good.
I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there?
This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.
I feel terrible.
Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.
I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.
Of course you feel terrible.
You completely screwed up your karma, dude.
You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?
It's not superstition, it's practically Newtonian.
For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
Leonard pretends to be a friend, and acts like a two-faced bitch.
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.
Speaking of what goes around comes around...
Okay, look.
Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here what if we ran another line, bypassed it entirely?
Won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
What if we reposition the collection tank?
It won't work.
No way to mount it.
Here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?
That could work.
- Morning.
- Morning.
What's up?
Nothing.
We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a Zero-Gravity pasta maker.
- I'm gonna make a coffee run.
Want any?
- No.
I have coffee.
Great, so how'd it go with Stuart last night?
I really don't wanna talk about it.
Yeah.
Right.
Sure.
But, you know, the thing is, before you guys went out...
- ...
I spoke to him and I...
- I said I don't wanna talk about it.
- Okay, I kind of feel res...
- Look, Leonard.
What goes on is none of your business.
So just leave it alone, okay?
If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freaking latte.
Hang on, I think I've got this.
Help me see if we can wedge this piece of PVC behind the support rod.
You're overestimating the strength of the substructure you're building.
- Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
- If you knew what you were doing there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.
Howard, wait.
Why don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the filter assembly in place?
Because this is not a spare part from the space station.
This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
Is that what that's for?
In India, the lid just touches the cheese.
We also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
- Where you going?
- Comic-book store.
Oh, an excellent idea.
I could certainly use a break.
- Me too.
- You can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
Why does Leonard get to go?
Because he's upset over his situation with Penny.
And if I have to hear about it again, I'm gonna kick him in his ovaries.
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
HOWARD:
I got your back, sister.
All right, I think we've got a prototype ready to test.
Hand me that Tupperware.
- That's heavy.
- Damn right, it's heavy.
It's my mother's meatloaf.
It's been testing toilets for generations.
I must say, Howard I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your Master's degree.
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meatloaf analog.
In three, two, one.
Fascinating.
What do you think the problem is?
Not enough bread crumbs.
- Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
- Sure, what's up?
I think I gave you some bad advice about Penny and I want to apologize.
No, your advice was great.
- It was?
- Oh, yeah, going slow really worked.
You're kidding.
Never worked for me.
Yeah, last night at dinner I did what you told me.
I went really slow, I kept my distance and two bottles of wine later, we were making out.
Wine?
I didn't say to give her wine.
It doesn't matter.
That's where it all went to hell.
During the kissing?
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.
No, everything was good and really hot.
And I said, "Oh, Penny" and right where she was supposed to say, "Oh, Stuart" she said your name.
- Leonard?
- That is your name, right?
Yeah.
No, yeah, it is.
Wow, I'm sorry.
That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.
Well, it beats, "You know I'm a dude, right?"
Yeah, it was pretty bad.
No doubt, no doubt.
Okay, well...
- ...
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
- Not your fault.
Yeah, how about that?
- See you soon.
- Yep, sure.
Yes, I understand.
Classified.
We'll keep it all classified.
No one has to know anything about this but you and me.
What's classified?
Howard's space toilet.
I'll tell you later.
Well, they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.
I don't see why I have to worry.
My career's not hanging in the balance.
That was a joke.
It's funny because it's true.
Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
- I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
- Yeah, I said Leonard.
Yes, you did, didn't you?
What the hell is that?
Meatloaf.
What was it doing on the ceiling?
That's classified.
ASTRONAUT [OVER RADIO]:
Houston, Internationale Space Station.
We have a little situation up here.
We'd like to make an unscheduled space walk.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
ISS, Houston which crew members would be involved in this EVA?
ASTRONAUT:
Houston, we'd all like to step outside for a few minutes.
MAN:
ISS, I'm afraid we can't authorize that.
ASTRONAUT:
Houston, this is more of an FYI call.
We are basically out the door.
[English
- US
- SDH]
[SNIFFS]
Smell that?
That's the smell of new comic books.
Oh, yes.
They're on me today, boys.
You're paying?
Have you been selling your sperm again?
No, I'm celebrating.
As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
Oh, get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.
Just think, thanks to your hard work an international crew of astronauts will boldly go where no man has gone before.
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.
The Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double meaning of "to go" suggest that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
Okay, make your little jokes.
But of the four of us I'm the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.
He's right.
This is an important achievement for two reasons:
Number one, and of course, number two.
[LAUGHING]
Oh, clever.
Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
[LAUGHS]
Here, Sheldon.
I pulled the new Hellboy for you.
It's mind-blowing.
Excuse me, spoiler alert.
But I didn't spoil anything.
You told me it's mind-blowing, so my mind is going into it pre-blown.
And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
- I'm sorry.
- Said the Grinch to Christmas.
- Hey, can I talk to you about something?
- Sure.
What's up?
Remember I went out with Penny a couple weeks ago?
- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure, you remember.
That was the night you went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
What about it?
Well, the thing is, the date didn't go that well.
Oh.
Too bad.
You know--
I guess the thing to do now is, you know, pick yourself up.
Dust yourself off, forget it.
Move on.
- I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?
Because we're going out again tomorrow.
Excuse me, Stuart?
- Have you read the new Flash?
- No.
Well, I have, and it will knock your socks off.
Good luck getting them back on.
Anyway, I figure this is probably my last shot with Penny...
- ...and I don't wanna screw it up.
- Oh, nobody wants that.
So here's my question:
It's the second date.
You think she'll be expecting things to get physical?
Oh, gee.
Yeah, my initial reaction is no.
But, you know, let me about it and get back to you, okay?
Okay.
So you'll give me a call?
- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.
Or nobody calls anyone.
Interesting, Penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
Yeah, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
You wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
- I'm listening.
- Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.
- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi.
- How's it going?
- Good, good.
- You?
- Fine.
- Oh, yeah, hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.
You know your friend Stuart?
Yes.
Well, he asked me out again and I said yes.
And then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
- About what?
- Well, does it bother you?
Me going out with one of your friends?
- Because, you know, you and me--
- No.
No, that's the past.
I'm really more of a right now kind of guy.
You know, living in the moment.
Although I do have to live a little in the future because, well, that's my job.
Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards but those stories often take place in the future, so--
In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.
Okay, well, that's really cool of you.
LEONARD:
Yeah?
Well, I wouldn't say cool.
I'd just say, "That's Leonard."
Well, in that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
About Stuart?
Love to.
He's very shy.
How do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
Well, first of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.
- Really?
- Well, yeah.
Stuart thrives under pressure.
That's why he works in a comic-book store.
[PHONE RINGING]
Oh.
It's Stuart.
[PHONE RINGING]
You're not going to answer it?
He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't wanna talk about Penny.
You're making an assumption.
Perhaps the comic book store is on fire.
And he needs your assistance.
Why would he call me?
We don't know.
And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.
I'm not answering the phone, Sheldon.
[PHONE RINGING]
- Answer the phone, Leonard.
- No.
[PHONE CHIMING]
There.
It went to voicemail.
Aren't you going to check your messages?
- No.
- You have to check your messages.
The leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message.
If that contract breaks down, then all social contracts break down.
And we descend into anarchy.
It must be hell inside your head.
At times.
Guys, we have a code red.
Code red, the hospital emergency alert?
The computer worm?
Or the cherry-flavored soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
I was going over the schematics on my Zero-G Toilet and I made a teeny-tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.
How teeny-tiny?
It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.
- But the mission is for six months.
- That's the code red.
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.
No one knows exactly when but at some point, something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
Have you notified NASA?
You crazy?
What am I gonna say?
I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there's gonna be crap floating all over your nice space station?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.
So, what do you need us for?
He can't figure out how to fix it.
You said you were gonna be supportive.
I'm trying.
But you have to admit, this is pretty damn funny.
I agree.
It's a juxtaposition of the nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here.
[LAUGHS]
Check your messages.
All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the Space Station.
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
Good one, yeah.
[FAKES LAUGH]
It's hilarious.
Now.
Here's an approximation of the spare parts available on the space station.
We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this.
So the waste material avoids the turbine.
You mean, so it doesn't hit the fan?
You know, I have to say I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition.
Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.
[KNOCKING]
- Hey, Leonard.
- Hey, Stuart.
- You busy?
- Uh--
Classified, Leonard.
Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project.
- What's up?
- Well, tonight's my date with Penny.
And we haven't been able to connect by phone--
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's been broken.
- Or e-mail.
Yeah, that's broken too.
Everything's broken.
Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
All right.
Well, off the top of my head you know, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow.
I mean, glacial.
- Okay.
- You know, guys come on to her all the time, so you need to, like, set yourself apart, you know?
Be a little shy.
And don't make too much eye contact.
And you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment.
And, you know, fear.
- Fear?
LEONARD:
Yeah.

For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.
All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC
- to reinforce the center cross-support?
- No good.
It might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there?
This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.
I feel terrible.
Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.
I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.
Of course you feel terrible.
You completely screwed up your karma.
You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?
It's not superstition.
It's practically Newtonian.
For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch.
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.
Speaking of what goes around comes around...
Okay, look.
Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
It won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
What if we reposition the collection tank?
It won't work.
No way to mount it.
Okay, here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?
That could work.
- Morning.
- Morning.
What's up?
Nothing.
We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity... pasta maker.
I'm gonna make a coffee run.
Do you want any?
No, thanks.
I have coffee.
Great.
So how'd it go with Stuart last night?
I really don't want to talk about it.
Yeah.
Right.
Sure.
The thing is, before you guys went out,
I spoke to him and...
I said I don't want to talk about it.
I just...
I kind of...
What goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business.
So just leave it alone, okay?
If you want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin' latte.
Hang on, I think I've got this.
Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.
You're overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you're building.
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.
Howard, wait.
Why don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
Because this is not a spare part from the space station.
This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
That what that's for?
In India, the lid touches the cheese.
Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
- Where are you going?
- Comic book store.
An excellent idea!
I could certainly use a break.
- Me, too.
- You can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
Why does Leonard get to go?
'Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
- I got your back, sister.
All right, I think we've got a prototype ready to test.
Hand me that Tupperware.
That's heavy.
Damn right it's heavy.
It's my mother's meat loaf.
It's been testing toilets for generations.
I must say,
I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree.
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in... three, two, one.
Fascinating.
What do you think the problem is?
Not enough bread crumbs.
Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
- Sure, what's up?
- I gave you bad advice about Penny,
- and I want to apologize.
- No, your advice was great.
- It was?
- Yeah, going slow really worked.
You're kidding.
Never worked for me.
Last night at dinner, I did what you told me.
I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.
Wine?
I didn't say to give her wine.
It doesn't matter, that's where it all went to hell.
During the kissing?
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.
No, everything was good and really hot.
And I said,
"Oh, Penny,"
and right where she was supposed to say, "Oh, Stuart," she said... your name.
That is your name, right?
I'm sorry.
That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.
It beats, "You know I'm a dude, right?"
Yeah, it was pretty bad.
No doubt, no doubt.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Not your fault.
Yeah, how about that?
- See you soon.
- Sure.
Yes, sir, I understand "classified."
We'll keep it all classified;
no one has to know but you and me.
What's classified?
Howard's space toilet.
I'll tell you later.
Well, they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.
I don't see why I have to worry.
My career's not hanging in the balance.
That was a joke.
It's funny, because it's true.
Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
Yeah, I said "Leonard."
Yes, you did, didn't you?
What the hell is that?
Meatloaf.
What was it doing on the ceiling?
That's classified.
Houston, International Space Station.
We have a little situation up here.
We'd like to make an unscheduled space walk.
I.S.S., Houston.
Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?
Houston, we'd all like to step outside for a few minutes.
I.S.S., I'm afraid we can't authorize that.
Houston, this is more of an FYI call.
We are basically out the door.
Smell that?
That's the smell of new comic books.
Oh, yes.
They're on me today, boys.
You're paying?
Have you been selling your sperm again?
No, I'm celebrating.
As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the Internationale Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
Oh, get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.
Just think, thanks to your hard work an international crew of astronauts will boldly go where no man has gone before.
-ls that supposed to be funny?
-I believe it is.
The Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double meaning of "to go" suggest that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
Okay, make your little jokes.
But of the four of us...
... I'm the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.
He's right.
This is an important achievement for two reasons:
Number one, and of course, number two.
Oh, clever.
Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
Here, Sheldon.
I pulled the new Hellboy for you.
It's mind-blowing.
Excuse me, spoiler alert.
But I didn't spoil anything.
You told me it's mind-blowing, so my mind is going into it pre-blown.
And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
-I'm sorry.
-Said the Grinch to Christmas.
-Hey, can I talk to you about something?
-Sure.
What's up?
Remember I went out with Penny a couple weeks ago?
-Yeah, vaguely.
-Sure, you remember.
That was the night...
...you went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
What about it?
Well, the thing is, the date didn't go that well.
Oh.
Too bad.
You know--
I guess the thing to do now is, you know, pick yourself up.
Dust yourself off, forget it.
Move on.
-I can't do that.
-Why the hell not?
Because we're going out again tomorrow.
Excuse me, Stuart?
-Have you read the new Flash?
-No.
Anyway, I figure this is probably my last shot with Penny...
-... andI don'twannascrewitup .
-Oh, nobody wants that.
So here's my question:
It's the second date.
You think she'll be expecting things to get physical?
Oh, gee.
Yeah, my initial reaction is no.
But, you know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?
Okay.
So you'll give me a call?
-Yeah, or you call me.
-Great.
Or nobody calls anyone.
Interesting, Penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
Yeah, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
You wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
-I'm listening.
-Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.
-Hey, Leonard.
-Oh, hi.
-How's it going?
-Good, good.
-You?
-Fine.
-Oh, yeah, hey, can I ask you something?
-Sure.
You know your friend Stuart?
Yes.
Well, he asked me out again and I said yes.
And then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
-About what?
-Well, does it bother you?
Me going out with one of your friends?
-Because, you know, you and me--
-No.
No, that's the past.
I'm really more of a right now kind of guy.
You know, living in the moment.
Although I do have to live a little in the future because, well, that's my job.
Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards but those stories often take place in the future, so--
In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.
Okay, well, that's really cool of you.
Yeah?
Well, I wouldn't say cool.
I'd just say, "That's Leonard."
Well, in that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
About Stuart?
Love to.
He's very shy.
How do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
Well, first of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.
-Really?
-Well, yeah.
Stuart thrives under pressure.
That's why he works in a comic-book store.
Oh.
It's Stuart.
You're not going to answer it?
He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't wanna talk about Penny.
You're making an assumption.
Perhaps the comic book store is on fire.
And he needs your assistance.
Why would he call me?
We don't know.
And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.
I'm not answering the phone, Sheldon.
-Answer the phone, Leonard.
-No.
There.
It went to voicemail.
Aren't you going to check your messages?
-No.
-You have to check your messages.
The leaving of a message is one half of a social contract...
...which is completed by the checking of the message.
If that contract breaks down, then all social contracts break down.
And we descend into anarchy.
It must be hell inside your head.
At times.
Guys, we have a code red.
Code red, the hospital emergency alert?
The computer worm?
Or the cherry-flavored soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
I was going over the schematics on my Zero-G Toilet and I made a teeny-tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.
How teeny-tiny?
It's gonna fail after about 1 0 flushes.
-But the mission is for six months.
-That's the code red.
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.
No one knows exactly when...
...but at some point, something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
Have you notified NASA?
You crazy?
What am I gonna say?
I screwed up your toilet...
...and pretty soon there's gonna be crap floating all over your nice space station?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.
So, what do you need us for?
He can't figure out how to fix it.
You said you were gonna be supportive.
I'm trying.
But you have to admit, this is pretty damn funny.
I agree.
It's a juxtaposition of the nature of space exploration...
...against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here.
Check your messages.
All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the Space Station.
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
Good one, yeah.
It's hilarious.
Now.
Here's an approximation of the spare parts available on the space station.
We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this.
So the waste material avoids the turbine.
You mean, so it doesn't hit the fan?
You know, I have to say I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition.
Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.
-Hey, Leonard.
-Hey, Stuart.
-You busy?
-Uh--
Classified, Leonard.
Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project.
-What's up?
-Well, tonight's my date with Penny.
And we haven't been able to connect by phone--
-Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's been broken.
-Or e-mail.
Yeah, that's broken too.
Everything's broken.
Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
All right.
Well, off the top of my head...
...you know, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow.
I mean, glacial.
-Okay.
-You know, guys come on to her...
...all the time, so you need to, like, set yourself apart, you know?
Be a little shy.
And don't make too much eye contact.
And you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment.
And, you know, fear.
- Fear?
- Yeah.
Like you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.
Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
Good, good.
Well, you kids have fun tonight.
Thanks, Leonard.
What is that thing anyway?
You don't know what this is?
-No.
-Good, get out.
Be afraid of Penny.
Nice, very crafty.
It wasn't bad advice.
It just wasn't particularly helpful.
For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain we make Jesus cry.

What if we reposition the collection tank?
It won't work.
No way to mount it.
Okay, here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?
That could work.
- Morning.
- Morning.
What's up?
Nothing.
We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity... pasta maker.
I'm gonna make a coffee run.
Do you want any?
No, thanks.
I have coffee.
Great.
So how'd it go with Stuart last night?
I really don't want to talk about it.
Yeah.
Right.
Sure.
The thing is, before you guys went out,
I spoke to him and...
I said I don't want to talk about it.
I just...
I kind of...
What goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business.
So just leave it alone, okay?
If you want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin' latte.
Hang on, I think I've got this.
Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.
You're overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you're building.
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.
Howard, wait.
Why don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
Because this is not a spare part from the space station.
This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
That what that's for?
In India, the lid touches the cheese.
Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
- Where are you going?
- Comic book store.
An excellent idea!
I could certainly use a break.
- Me, too.
- You can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
Why does Leonard get to go?
'Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
- I got your back, sister.
All right, I think we've got a prototype ready to test.
Hand me that Tupperware.
That's heavy.
Damn right it's heavy.
It's my mother's meat loaf.
It's been testing toilets for generations.
I must say,
I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree.
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in... three, two, one.
Fascinating.
What do you think the problem is?
Not enough bread crumbs.
Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
- Sure, what's up?
- I gave you bad advice about Penny,
- and I want to apologize.
- No, your advice was great.
- It was?
- Yeah, going slow really worked.
You're kidding.
Never worked for me.
Last night at dinner, I did what you told me.
I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.
Wine?
I didn't say to give her wine.
It doesn't matter, that's where it all went to hell.
During the kissing?
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.
No, everything was good and really hot.
And I said,
"Oh, Penny,"
and right where she was supposed to say, "Oh, Stuart," she said... your name.
That is your name, right?
I'm sorry.
That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.
It beats, "You know I'm a dude, right?"
Yeah, it was pretty bad.
No doubt, no doubt.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Not your fault.
Yeah, how about that?
- See you soon.
- Sure.
Yes, sir, I understand "classified."
We'll keep it all classified;
no one has to know but you and me.
What's classified?
Howard's space toilet.
I'll tell you later.
Well, they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.
I don't see why I have to worry.
My career's not hanging in the balance.
That was a joke.
It's funny, because it's true.
Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
Yeah, I said "Leonard."
Yes, you did, didn't you?
What the hell is that?
Meatloaf.
What was it doing on the ceiling?
That's classified.
Houston, International Space Station.
We have a little situation up here.
We'd like to make an unscheduled space walk.
I.S.S., Houston.
Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?
Houston, we'd all like to step outside for a few minutes.
I.S.S., I'm afraid we can't authorize that.
Houston, this is more of an FYI call.
We are basically out the door.
Smell that?
That's the smell of new comic books.
Oh, yes.
They're on me today, boys.
You're paying?
Have you been selling your sperm again?
No, I'm celebrating.
As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
Oh, get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.
Just think, thanks to your hard work an international crew of astronauts will boldly go where no man has gone before.
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.
The Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double meaning of "to go" suggest that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
Okay, make your little jokes.
But of the four of us I'm the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.
He's right.
This is an important achievement for two reasons,
Number one, and of course, number two.
Oh, clever.
Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
Here, Sheldon.
I pulled the new Hellboy for you.
It's mind-blowing.
Excuse me, spoiler alert.
But I didn't spoil anything.
You told me it's mind-blowing, so my mind is going into it pre-blown.
And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
- I'm sorry.
- Said the Grinch to Christmas.
- Hey, can I talk to you about something?
- Sure.
What's up?
Remember I went out with Penny a couple weeks ago?
- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure, you remember.
That was the night you went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
What about it?
Well, the thing is, the date didn't go that well.
Oh.
Too bad.
You know...
I guess the thing to do now is, you know, pick yourself up.
Dust yourself off, forget it.
Move on.
- I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?
Because we're going out again tomorrow.
Excuse me, Stuart?
- Have you read the new Flash?
- No.
Well, I have, and it will knock your socks off.
Good luck getting them back on.
Anyway, I figure this is probably my last shot with Penny...
- ...and I don't wanna screw it up.
- Oh, nobody wants that.
So here's my question,
It's the second date.
You think she'll be expecting things to get physical?
Oh, gee.
Yeah, my initial reaction is no.
But, you know, let me about it and get back to you, okay?
Okay.
So you'll give me a call?
- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.
Or nobody calls anyone.
Interesting, Penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
Yeah, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
You wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
- I'm listening.
- Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.
- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi.
- How's it going?
- Good, good.
- You?
- Fine.
- Oh, yeah, hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.
You know your friend Stuart?
Yes.
Well, he asked me out again and I said yes.
And then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
- About what?
- Well, does it bother you?
Me going out with one of your friends?
- Because, you know, you and me...
- No.
No, that's the past.
I'm really more of a right now kind of guy.
You know, living in the moment.
Although I do have to live a little in the future because, well, that's my job.
Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards but those stories often take place in the future, so...
In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.
Okay, well, that's really cool of you.
Yeah?
Well, I wouldn't say cool.
I'd just say, "That's Leonard."
Well, in that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
About Stuart?
Love to.
He's very shy.
How do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
Well, first of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.
- Really?
- Well, yeah.
Stuart thrives under pressure.
That's why he works in a comic-book store.
Oh.
It's Stuart.
You're not going to answer it?
He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't wanna talk about Penny.
You're making an assumption.
Perhaps the comic book store is on fire.
And he needs your assistance.
Why would he call me?
We don't know.
And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.
I'm not answering the phone, Sheldon.
- Answer the phone, Leonard.
- No.
There.
It went to voice-mail.
Aren't you going to check your messages?
- No.
- You have to check your messages.
The leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message.
If that contract breaks down, then all social contracts break down.
And we descend into anarchy.
It must be hell inside your head.
At times.
Guys, we have a code red.
Code red, the hospital emergency alert?
The computer worm?
Or the cherry-flavored soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
I was going over the schematics on my Zero-G Toilet and I made a teeny-tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.
How teeny-tiny?
It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.
- But the mission is for six months.
- That's the code red.
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.
No one knows exactly when but at some point, something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
Have you notified NASA?
You crazy?
What am I gonna say?
I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there's gonna be crap floating all over your nice space station?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.
So, what do you need us for?
He can't figure out how to fix it.
You said you were gonna be supportive.
I'm trying.
But you have to admit, this is pretty damn funny.
I agree.
It's a juxtaposition of the nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here.
Check your messages.
All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the Space Station.
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
Good one, yeah.
It's hilarious.
Now.
Here's an approximation of the spare parts available on the space station.
We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this.
So the waste material avoids the turbine.
You mean, so it doesn't hit the fan?
You know, I have to say I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition.
Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.
- Hey, Leonard.
- Hey, Stuart.
- You busy?
- Uh...
Classified, Leonard.
Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project.
- What's up?
- Well, tonight's my date with Penny.
And we haven't been able to connect by phone...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's been broken.
- Or e-mail.
Yeah, that's broken too.
Everything's broken.
Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
All right.
Well, off the top of my head you know, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow.
I mean, glacial.
- Okay.
- You know, guys come on to her all the time, so you need to, like, set yourself apart, you know?
Be a little shy.
And don't make too much eye contact.
And you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment.
And, you know, fear.
- Fear?
- Yeah.
Like you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.
Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
Good, good.
Well, you kids have fun tonight.
Thanks, Leonard.
What is that thing anyway?
You don't know what this is?
- No.
- Good, get out.
Be afraid of Penny.
Nice, very crafty.
It wasn't bad advice.
It just wasn't particularly helpful.
For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain we make Jesus cry.
All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the center cross-support?
No good.
I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there?
This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.
I feel terrible.
Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.
I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.
Of course you feel terrible.
You completely screwed up your karma, dude.
You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?
It's not superstition, it's practically Newtonian.
For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
Leonard pretends to be a friend, and acts like a two-faced bitch.
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.
Speaking of what goes around comes around...
Okay, look.
Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here what if we ran another line, bypassed it entirely?
Won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
What if we reposition the collection tank?
It won't work.
No way to mount it.
Here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?

Howard, wait.
Why don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
Because this is not a spare part from the space station.
This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
That what that's for?
In India, the lid touches the cheese.
Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
- Where are you going?
- Comic book store.
An excellent idea!
I could certainly use a break.
- Me, too.
- You can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
Why does Leonard get to go?
'Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
- I got your back, sister.
All right, I think we've got a prototype ready to test.
Hand me that Tupperware.
That's heavy.
Damn right it's heavy.
It's my mother's meat loaf.
It's been testing toilets for generations.
I must say,
I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree.
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in... three, two, one.
Fascinating.
What do you think the problem is?
Not enough bread crumbs.
Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
- Sure, what's up?
- I gave you bad advice about Penny,
- and I want to apologize.
- No, your advice was great.
- It was?
- Yeah, going slow really worked.
You're kidding.
Never worked for me.
Last night at dinner, I did what you told me.
I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.
Wine?
I didn't say to give her wine.
It doesn't matter, that's where it all went to hell.
During the kissing?
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.
No, everything was good and really hot.
And I said,
"Oh, Penny,"
and right where she was supposed to say, "Oh, Stuart," she said... your name.
That is your name, right?
I'm sorry.
That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.
It beats, "You know I'm a dude, right?"
Yeah, it was pretty bad.
No doubt, no doubt.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Not your fault.
Yeah, how about that?
- See you soon.
- Sure.
Yes, sir, I understand "classified."
We'll keep it all classified;
no one has to know but you and me.
What's classified?
Howard's space toilet.
I'll tell you later.
Well, they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.
I don't see why I have to worry.
My career's not hanging in the balance.
That was a joke.
It's funny, because it's true.
Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
Yeah, I said "Leonard."
Yes, you did, didn't you?
What the hell is that?
Meatloaf.
What was it doing on the ceiling?
That's classified.
Houston, International Space Station.
We have a little situation up here.
We'd like to make an unscheduled space walk.
I.S.S., Houston.
Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?
Houston, we'd all like to step outside for a few minutes.
I.S.S., I'm afraid we can't authorize that.
Houston, this is more of an FYI call.
We are basically out the door.
Smell that?
That's the smell of new comic books.
They're on me today, boys.
You're paying?
Have you been selling your sperm again?
No, I'm celebrating.
As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
Get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.
Just think.
Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will "boldly go where no man has gone before."
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.
The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb "to go"
suggests that Leonard is mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I'm the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.
He's right.
This is an important achievement, for two reasons.
Number one... and, of course, number two!
Clever!
Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you.
It's mind-blowing.
Excuse me.
Spoiler alert.
I didn't spoil anything.
You told me it's mind-blowing.
So, my mind is going into it pre-blown.
And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
I'm sorry.
Said the Grinch to Christmas.
- Can I talk to you about something?
- What's up?
Remember I went out with Penny, a couple weeks ago?
- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure you remember.
You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
What about it?
The thing is, the date didn't go that well.
Too bad.
I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.
- I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?
'Cause we're going out again tomorrow.
Excuse me, Stuart.
Have you read the new Flash?
Well, I have and it will knock your socks off!
Good luck getting them back on.
This is probably my last shot with Penny and I don't want to screw it up.
Nobody wants that.
So, here's my question:
It's the second date, you think she'll be expecting things to get physical?
Gee...
My initial reaction is "no,"
but let me think about it and get back to you.
So, you'll give me a call?
- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.
Or nobody calls anyone.
Interesting.
Penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
I'm listening.
Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.
Subtitles:
The FW Team
- How's it going?
- Good, good.
You?
Fine.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
You know your friend Stuart?
He asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
About what?
Does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends?
'Cause you know, you and me...
No, that's the past.
I'm really more of a "right now" kind of guy.
You know, living in the moment.
Although I do have to live a little in the future, 'cause that's my job.
Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future.
In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.
Okay, well, that's really cool of you.
I wouldn't say cool.
I'd just say... "That's Leonard!"
In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
About Stuart?
Love to.
He's very shy.
How do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
First of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.
Really?
Stuart thrives under pressure.
That's why he works in a comic book store.
It's Stuart.
You're not going to answer it?
He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't want to talk about Penny.
You're making an assumption.
Perhaps the comic book store is on fire.
And he needs your assistance.
Why would he call me?
We don't know.
And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.
I'm not answering the phone.
Answer the phone, Leonard.
There, it went to voice mail.
Aren't you going to check your messages?
You have to check your messages!
The living of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message.
If that contract breaks down, then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.
It must be hell inside your head.
At times.
Guys, we have a code red.
"Code Red" the hospital emergency alert, the computer worm, or the cherry-flavored soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.
How teeny tiny?
It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.
- But the mission is for six months.
- See, that's the code red.
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.
No one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
Have you notified NASA?
Are you crazy?
What am I gonna say?
"I screwed up your toilet and there's gonna be crap floating
"all over your nice shiny space station"?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.
So, what do you need us for?
He can't figure out how to fix it.
You said you were gonna be supportive.
I'm trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.
I agree.
It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here.
Check your messages.
All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
Good one.
It's hilarious.
Now...
Here's an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station.
We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.
You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?
I have to say,
I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition.
Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.
You busy?
Classified, Leonard.
Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project.
What's up?
Tonight's my date with Penny and since we haven't been able to connect by phone...
I'm sorry, it's been broken.
- Or e-mail.
- Yeah, that too.
Everything's broken.
Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
All right, well, off the top of my head,
I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow.
I mean, glacial.
Guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to set yourself apart.
Be a little shy, don't make too much eye contact.
And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and-and, you know, fear.
- Fear?
- Yeah, like, you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.
Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
Good, good.
You kids have fun tonight.
Thanks, Leonard.
What is that thing anyway?
You don't know what this is?
Good.
Get out.
Be afraid of Penny.
Nice.
Very crafty.
It wasn't bad advice.
It's just wasn't particularly helpful.
For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.
All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC
- to reinforce the center cross-support?
- No good.
It might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there?
This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.
I feel terrible.
Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.
I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.
Of course you feel terrible.
You completely screwed up your karma.
You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?
It's not superstition.
It's practically Newtonian.
For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch.
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.
Speaking of what goes around comes around...
Okay, look.
Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
It won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
What if we reposition the collection tank?
It won't work.
No way to mount it.
Okay, here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?
That could work.
- Morning.
- Morning.
What's up?
Nothing.
We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity... pasta maker.
I'm gonna make a coffee run.
Do you want any?
No, thanks.
I have coffee.
Great.
So how'd it go with Stuart last night?
I really don't want to talk about it.
Yeah.
Right.
Sure.
The thing is, before you guys went out,
I spoke to him and...
I said I don't want to talk about it.
I just...
I kind of...
What goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business.
So just leave it alone, okay?
If you want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin' latte.
Hang on, I think I've got this.
Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.
You're overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you're building.
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.

What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.
No, everything was good and really hot.
And I said,
"Oh, Penny,"
and right where she was supposed to say, "Oh, Stuart," she said... your name.
That is your name, right?
I'm sorry.
That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.
It beats, "You know I'm a dude, right?"
Yeah, it was pretty bad.
No doubt, no doubt.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Not your fault.
Yeah, how about that?
- See you soon.
- Sure.
Yes, sir, I understand "classified."
We'll keep it all classified;
no one has to know but you and me.
What's classified?
Howard's space toilet.
I'll tell you later.
Well, they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.
I don't see why I have to worry.
My career's not hanging in the balance.
That was a joke.
It's funny, because it's true.
Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
Yeah, I said "Leonard."
Yes, you did, didn't you?
What the hell is that?
Meatloaf.
What was it doing on the ceiling?
That's classified.
Houston, International Space Station.
We have a little situation up here.
We'd like to make an unscheduled space walk.
I.S.S., Houston.
Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?
Houston, we'd all like to step outside for a few minutes.
I.S.S., I'm afraid we can't authorize that.
Houston, this is more of an FYI call.
We are basically out the door.
Smell that?
That's the smell of new comic books.
They're on me today, boys.
You're paying?
Have you been selling your sperm again?
No, I'm celebrating.
As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
Get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.
Just think.
Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will "boldly go where no man has gone before."
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.
The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb "to go"
suggests that Leonard is mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I'm the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.
He's right.
This is an important achievement, for two reasons.
Number one... and, of course, number two!
Clever!
Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you.
It's mind-blowing.
Excuse me.
Spoiler alert.
I didn't spoil anything.
You told me it's mind-blowing.
So, my mind is going into it pre-blown.
And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
I'm sorry.
Said the Grinch to Christmas.
- Can I talk to you about something?
- What's up?
Remember I went out with Penny, a couple weeks ago?
- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure you remember.
You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
What about it?
The thing is, the date didn't go that well.
Too bad.
I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.
- I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?
'Cause we're going out again tomorrow.
Excuse me, Stuart.
Have you read the new Flash?
Well, I have and it will knock your socks off!
Good luck getting them back on.
This is probably my last shot with Penny and I don't want to screw it up.
Nobody wants that.
So, here's my question:
It's the second date, you think she'll be expecting things to get physical?
Gee...
My initial reaction is "no,"
but let me think about it and get back to you.
So, you'll give me a call?
- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.
Or nobody calls anyone.
Interesting.
Penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
I'm listening.
Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.
Subtitles:
The FW Team
- How's it going?
- Good, good.
You?
Fine.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
You know your friend Stuart?
He asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
About what?
Does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends?
'Cause you know, you and me...
No, that's the past.
I'm really more of a "right now" kind of guy.
You know, living in the moment.
Although I do have to live a little in the future, 'cause that's my job.
Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future.
In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.
Okay, well, that's really cool of you.
I wouldn't say cool.
I'd just say... "That's Leonard!"
In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
About Stuart?
Love to.
He's very shy.
How do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
First of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.
Really?
Stuart thrives under pressure.
That's why he works in a comic book store.
It's Stuart.
You're not going to answer it?
He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't want to talk about Penny.
You're making an assumption.
Perhaps the comic book store is on fire.
And he needs your assistance.
Why would he call me?
We don't know.
And if you don't answer the phone, we can't know.
I'm not answering the phone.
Answer the phone, Leonard.
There, it went to voice mail.
Aren't you going to check your messages?
You have to check your messages!
The living of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message.
If that contract breaks down, then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.
It must be hell inside your head.
At times.
Guys, we have a code red.
"Code Red" the hospital emergency alert, the computer worm, or the cherry-flavored soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.
How teeny tiny?
It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.
- But the mission is for six months.
- See, that's the code red.
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.
No one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
Have you notified NASA?
Are you crazy?
What am I gonna say?
"I screwed up your toilet and there's gonna be crap floating
"all over your nice shiny space station"?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I'll tell them.
So, what do you need us for?
He can't figure out how to fix it.
You said you were gonna be supportive.
I'm trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.
I agree.
It's the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here.
Check your messages.
All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
Good one.
It's hilarious.
Now...
Here's an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station.
We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.
You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?
I have to say,
I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition.
Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.
You busy?
Classified, Leonard.
Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project.
What's up?
Tonight's my date with Penny and since we haven't been able to connect by phone...
I'm sorry, it's been broken.
- Or e-mail.
- Yeah, that too.
Everything's broken.
Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
All right, well, off the top of my head,
I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow.
I mean, glacial.
Guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to set yourself apart.
Be a little shy, don't make too much eye contact.
And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and-and, you know, fear.
- Fear?
- Yeah, like, you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.
Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
Good, good.
You kids have fun tonight.
Thanks, Leonard.
What is that thing anyway?
You don't know what this is?
Good.
Get out.
Be afraid of Penny.
Nice.
Very crafty.
It wasn't bad advice.
It's just wasn't particularly helpful.
For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.
All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC
- to reinforce the center cross-support?
- No good.
It might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there?
This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.
I feel terrible.
Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself.
I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.
Of course you feel terrible.
You completely screwed up your karma.
You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?
It's not superstition.
It's practically Newtonian.
For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch.
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.
Speaking of what goes around comes around...
Okay, look.
Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
It won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
What if we reposition the collection tank?
It won't work.
No way to mount it.
Okay, here's an idea.
What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?
That could work.
- Morning.
- Morning.
What's up?
Nothing.
We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity... pasta maker.
I'm gonna make a coffee run.
Do you want any?
No, thanks.
I have coffee.
Great.
So how'd it go with Stuart last night?
I really don't want to talk about it.
Yeah.
Right.
Sure.
The thing is, before you guys went out,
I spoke to him and...
I said I don't want to talk about it.
I just...
I kind of...
What goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business.
So just leave it alone, okay?
If you want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin' latte.
Hang on, I think I've got this.
Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.
You're overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you're building.
Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn't be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.
Howard, wait.
Why don't you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
Because this is not a spare part from the space station.
This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
That what that's for?
In India, the lid touches the cheese.
Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
- Where are you going?
- Comic book store.
An excellent idea!
I could certainly use a break.
- Me, too.
- You can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
Why does Leonard get to go?
'Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
- I got your back, sister.
All right, I think we've got a prototype ready to test.
Hand me that Tupperware.
That's heavy.
Damn right it's heavy.
It's my mother's meat loaf.
It's been testing toilets for generations.
I must say,
I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree.
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in... three, two, one.
Fascinating.
What do you think the problem is?
Not enough bread crumbs.
Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
- Sure, what's up?
- I gave you bad advice about Penny,
- and I want to apologize.
- No, your advice was great.
- It was?
- Yeah, going slow really worked.
You're kidding.
Never worked for me.
Last night at dinner, I did what you told me.
I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.
Wine?
I didn't say to give her wine.
It doesn't matter, that's where it all went to hell.
During the kissing?
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.
No, everything was good and really hot.
And I said,
"Oh, Penny,"
and right where she was supposed to say, "Oh, Stuart," she said... your name.
That is your name, right?
I'm sorry.
That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.
It beats, "You know I'm a dude, right?"
Yeah, it was pretty bad.
No doubt, no doubt.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Not your fault.
Yeah, how about that?
- See you soon.
- Sure.
Yes, sir, I understand "classified."
We'll keep it all classified;
no one has to know but you and me.
What's classified?
Howard's space toilet.
I'll tell you later.
Well, they've deployed our solution.

My career's not hanging in the balance.

Murdoch Mysteries S02E05
Excuse me.
Get out!
Go!
Get out!
Where's Cora?
Did you see Cora?
Did anybody see Cora?
Cora?
!
What have we, George?
The fire started around midnight, sir.
And the cause?
An incendiary device was thrown through this window.
Glass.
Housed in a bottle, it would seem.
Gather up all the shards.
See if we can raise fingermarks.
Some may have survived the fire.
What else?
The madam couldn't find one of her... employees.
Mm-hmm.
She went to look for her in her room.
Where she found the victim.
Exactly.
Right, then.
Nothing's to be touched.
I want a list of everyone that was here tonight.
The girls, their customers -- everyone.
Oh, sir, that list could include the mayor, a bishop.
I mean, this was, after all, the Music Academy.
It could include the chief constable himself.
I want that list.
Sir.
The body's up this way.
This is how the madam found her.
Good Lord.
It's a horrible wound.
She appears to have been garroted.
Do we know her name?
Cora Devereaux, age 23.
Letters from admirers.
It appears Miss Devereaux was a very popular woman.
Perhaps it had something to do with her taste in fine spirits.
- Ab-sinthe.
Ab-seenthe?
- Absinthe.
It's a liquor popular in Europe amongst the intelligentsia.
Made with an herb -
- Wormwood.
Said to cause hallucinations.
Hallucinations?
How intriguing.
- Anything else, George?
- No, sir.
That's all the madam would tell me.
Oh?
Was she being uncooperative?
Well, sir, she said she wanted to give the rest of her statement to you personally.
Really?
Where is she now?
Right here, William.
It's good to see you again.
Always a pleasure, Miss Weston despite the circumstances.
I've always looked after my girls.
Arranged doctors, kept their bellies full, advised on affairs of the heart.
I didn't do a very good job with Cora, I'm afraid.
What can you tell me about her?
Not much.
She was in high demand with my customers, even though she'd only been here a short while.
Oh?
How long?
About six months.
And where was she before that?
- Montreal.
- What brought her here?
I believe she had a spot of trouble.
What kind of trouble?
A violent customer.
Had she any difficulties with customers here?
One.
Arthur Webster.
The painter?
He'd become obsessed with her.
In my experience, that can only lead to trouble.
I see.
He refused to leave tonight, so I had him removed.
Tonight?
When was this?
Around 10:00.
Two hours before you discovered Miss Devereaux's body.
He could have returned, killed her, and set fire to the house to cover his tracks.
Except I keep the doors locked at all times.
Security is very important for my girls and my clients.
Perhaps he found a way to sneak in.
Well, I suppose that's possible.
Well, I think that's enough for now, Miss Weston.
Thank you.
William.
In all these years, you haven't changed.
Not a bit.
And you, Ettie.
You've done very well for yourself.
Ah.
Doctor.
Detective.
May I ask why such a pretty dress for a murder?
Oh.
A gentleman asked me to dinner.
Oh?
Yes.
A rather stuffy accountant, as it turns out.
He was busy explaining the difference between single- and double-entry bookkeeping when I was called away.
The garrote appears to have severed both the carotid artery and the jugular vein.
So the killer would have been covered in blood?
Not necessarily.
The attack appears to have been from behind, meaning he would have avoided most of the blood spray.
This is most interesting.
What is it?
There's another scar winding around her neck suggesting a previous attempt to garrote the victim.
As though someone returned to finish a job they had already started.
Well, this is a right cock-up.
What have you got there?
What does this smell remind you of, sir?
Mineral spirits?
More specifically, turpentine.
Mm.
Fuel used in the fire bomb, was it?
One of them.
Likely the accelerant.
To light something heavier.
Kerosene more than likely.
At least that's what they taught us in the regiment.
So the killer chucks it in through the window, hoping to cover his tracks.
But the bomb was poorly constructed.
Caused more smoke than fire.
Many lives were spared.
Do we know which of the city fathers were caught with their strides down?
- Strides?
- Trous--
Uh, pants, pants.
Yes.
I have a list.
Mm.
Bloody hell, Murdoch.
Don't let this out of your sight.
We're not gonna be able to keep what happened out of the press, but at least we can try and limit the damage.
There's quite a few friends of the department on here.
Yes.
I'll try to ensure discretion.
Do we have a suspect?
Yes.
A painter with a jealous obsession.
Miss Devereaux... dead?
It can't be.
I'm sorry to have to inform you, Mr. Webster.
Turpentine.
To clean my brushes.
What of it?
We believe it was used to set the fire.
But surely you don't think that I had something to --
Mr. Webster, you had to be forcibly removed from the brothel last night.
Sometimes I find it difficult to leave Miss Devereaux.
Surely you've felt the same way towards a love.
Where did you go afterwards?
I came here to paint.
I am... was always so inspired after being with her.
She was my muse.
You were obsessed with her.
So much so that you couldn't stand the thought of other men being with her.
I had already accepted that situation, as unfortunate as it was.
Unfortunate?
Yes.
Her heart belonged to another.
I'm sorry to disturb you at your home, Judge Wilson, but as I mentioned, this is an urgent matter.
I'm sorry I haven't much time.
My caseload lately is very heavy.
Yes.
I'll try to be brief.
Are you familiar with the Weston Music Academy?
No, I am not.
Should I be?
It's a brothel, sir.
A young woman was murdered there last night.
I see.
Most unfortunate.
Sir, I believe you were a client of the victim's.
Are you suggesting that I frequent brothels, Detective?
With all due respect, sir, you were mentioned by name.
Well, many people would like to see me removed from the bench.
This is probably some ploy to discredit me.
Where were you last night?
I was working late in chambers.
And then I returned home.
What time?
About 10:00.
I had a small glass of sherry, and then I went to bed.
And you remained here at home the whole night?
You're quite certain?
I think I would know if I'd gotten out of bed, don't you?
Now, if there's nothing further, Detective, I'm needed in court.
Inspector.
There's a gentleman from the Temperance League to see you.
A Mr. Beecher.
Beecher?
Bollocks.
And there you go, sir.
Send him in.
- Go on in.
- Thank you.
Inspector, the Temperance League is no longer simply concerned with the evils of drink.
All of society's woes require our attention.
So the missus has told me, Mr. Beecher.
In particular, it's the houses of ill fame and the plight of the women in them that concern us.
Same goes for the police.
Well, so you say.
And yet, Inspector, for some time, the entire constabulary, yourself included, has tolerated the existence of the Music Academy because it caters to the city's elite.
You and I both know that that place is first-class.
Those lasses are well looked after.
Are they?
Perhaps Miss Devereaux's parents would disagree.
Inspector, on behalf of the thousands of Temperance League members, staunch supporters of our cause, like your wife,
I demand that place be shut down immediately.
You can tell your members that the police are doing their job.
In fact, we already have a suspect.
- Oh?
- Yes.
An artist.
An artist.
I see.
Somewhat convenient, Inspector, but a suspect nonetheless, huh?
- What are you implying, sir?
- I'm not implying.
I'm merely noting that of all the powerful people in that brothel, a lowly artist is the suspect.
Facts do not lie, sir.
Of course they don't.
Inspector, the Temperance League will be watching the progress of this case.
If justice is not served, you will be hearing from us.
I can't wait.
I would place time of death roughly around midnight.
Consistent with when the fire broke out.
The stomach contents revealed nothing out of the ordinary, except that she'd had an aperitif shortly before she was murdered.
Anise-based, I believe.
There was a bottle of absinthe in the room.
Oh?
The green fairy.
Green fairy?
Yes, the inspiration of many a poet.
Some say she can be seen after drinking it.
Or overindulging in it.
It's a most exotic drink.
No doubt supplied by your friend, the madam.
How did you two meet?
A church function, perhaps?
Actually, we met during a case.
Her friend Alice Black, also a prostitute, was murdered.
Oh.
Fortunately, I managed to save Ettie -- Miss Weston's life.
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to imply --
I also misjudged Miss Weston when I first met her.
Were there any defensive wounds?
There would have been no time to struggle.
Death would have been almost instantaneous.
There was this, however.
Mm.
Any idea how she got those scars?
A whip or a lash, I should think.
I've heard that those can be used in sex play.
Yes.
These scars are very nasty, though.
I don't think there was any play involved.
No, I suppose not.
Listen.
She was a doxy.
She did things for money, and some people pay for pain.
Might explain how she got that older scar on her neck as well.
I highly doubt she would let someone do that to her, no matter the price.
She did allow herself to be put in a vulnerable position, allowing men to put things around her neck and so on.
She wouldn't have noticed the garrote until it was too late.
Something happened to her in Montreal.
I have a mate on the force there.
He might be able to tell us a bit more.
Sir, there's someone here to see you.
I'm Detective William Murdoch.
Yes.
I'm Paul Wilson, His Honor's son.
Ah, yes.
Of course.
Mr. Wilson, how can I help you?
Well, this is rather difficult, and I fear that it may implicate my father in something unseemly.
But if I'm not mistaken,
Father told you he didn't go out last night, did he not?
That's correct.
Well, I remember waking in the middle of the night, and I heard someone come into the house.
There was a lot of commotion, banging and whatnot.
Did you investigate?
This is very difficult for me.
It was Father.
You're certain?
He's recently taken to coming in at all hours of the night.
Mm.
I see.
I'll be sure to look into this.
Unfortunately, there's more.
I...
I feel terrible about this.
I found these in the rear of his wardrobe.
I'll ask you one more time, Judge Wilson.
How did you get the bloodstains on your clothes?
I couldn't tell you.
You'll have to forgive me, Your Honor, but you're not being forthcoming.
I'm telling you what I know.
You also told me you never left your home.
I just... don't know what happened.
How can that be?
Either you left your home or you didn't.
Such a damn muddle, I can barely remember a thing.
Let me help you.
You went to the brothel.
You saw Miss Devereaux.
Yes.
Cora.
What time was this?
About 11:00.
And then what?
I...
I must have dozed off.
We'd been drinking, and when I woke there was blood, and she was there beside me dead.
And the next thing I know, I was in front of my door at home.
And you have no idea how you got there?
- No.
- Yet you had the good sense to remove the bloodstained clothing.
Yes, I suppose so, yes.
But I didn't kill her.
Of this, I am certain.
How can you be?
You don't seem certain of anything else.
Have you ever been in love?
Deeply and profoundly in love?
I have.
Well, then you understand when I tell you that, no matter how confused I am,
I-I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Cora.
Why else would I have asked her to be my bride?
He's gone completely daft.
A judge just can't up and marry some scarlet woman.
He'd be throwing away his career.
According to the judge, they were very much in love.
Love.
Ha!
The only thing she loved was his money.
And I think the judge finally realized that as well.
You think he discovered Miss Devereaux was a gold digger.
And in a blind rage, killed her.
How could he have been in her room and thrown the fire bomb at the same time?
That's a good point.
And for that matter, why not just set fire to the bed with her in it?
Why not, indeed.
The killer wasn't trying to cover up his crime.
He threw the fire bomb to create a diversion.
And in the confusion, slips in, goes upstairs, kills Miss Devereaux.
Bloody diabolical.
But then why is the judge still alive?
Perhaps someone wanted us to think that he was the killer.
Then again, maybe the judge had a partner, and this is all just a wild theory.
Seems we've got nothing but questions.
Why am I here, William?
You know very well why you're here.
The judge was in Miss Devereaux's room, wasn't he?
I'm sorry.
Tell me what happened.
And I want the truth this time.
Very well.
Cora?
!
I went to Cora's room, looking for her, just as I told you.
When I opened the door, I saw him... holding her crying.
The building was burning, so I helped him out, and I had him taken home.
Even though he murdered one of your own girls?
He did not murder Cora.
How can you be certain?
You found him over the body.
If you know anything about me, William, it's that I'm an expert on men.
You won't deny that it's useful to have a judge in your pocket.
You trusted me in the past when so many wouldn't.
Trust me now.
Very well.
In the past, Miss Devereaux was involved with customers who enjoyed the lash.
Am I correct?
Yes, in Montreal.
And did she have any clients here with that certain proclivity?
One.
- The judge?
- No.
Of course not.
Then who?
What's the meaning of this?
I searched the rest of your house and found these in your bedside table.
What was the nature of your relationship with Miss Devereaux?
Miss Devereaux... dominated, disciplined me.
You couldn't possibly understand.
Oh, I think I understand you fully.
You enjoyed being humiliated.
Or at least you thought you did... until Miss Devereaux decided to marry the judge.
That was too much humiliation for even you to endure.
My wanting to kill Miss Devereaux is as unlikely as the judge wanting to.
You don't think he had reason?
I had only respect for the way he treated Miss Devereaux.
Now, his son -
- That is a completely different story.
His son?
Miss Devereaux had ordered me to accompany her to an opening at the art gallery.
Young Mr. Wilson approached her, accused her of being after his father's money, was insulting and so furious I actually feared he would strike her.
I was about to put him in his place, but Miss Devereaux commanded me not to.
I see.
Mr. Wilson.
That's quite a contraption.
Yes!
Isn't it?
An electric carriage.
One of the first in the city.
Mm.
Do you own it?
Well, I'm considering it.
But frankly, it's difficult to get excited about anything, given what's happened to Father.
Unless you've come with good news?
There have been recent developments.
Wonderful.
Assuming it's something that will exonerate him.
I understand you had an extremely vitriolic exchange with the victim.
It was a heated argument, true.
But I was determined to protect Father.
Protect him?
From what?
From that woman dragging his good name through the mud.
She would have ruined him, professionally, socially.
Financially?
Well, that is what happens when one falls victim to an avaricious manipulator who's only after one's estate.
It certainly is.
Are you saying you suspect Paul?
His behavior makes me curious.
His behavior?
He had a heated argument with Miss Devereaux.
Paul did not take well to my decision to marry Cora.
And why not?
I've coddled Paul since his mother died.
He worshiped her.
And it's likely he thought he was defending her honor.
Perhaps.
Or perhaps he felt that his finances were being threatened by your impending marriage.
I don't see why he would feel that way.
I had my attorney draw up a contract leaving him half of my estate in the event of my death.
What if half wasn't enough?
Detective, my son's flaws are many.
He's a talented pianist who never plays.
He requires constant validation from friends who don't care for him.
He's never worked a day in his life.
But he's still my son.
I see.
If I may, how were you planning to deal with the... ramifications of your marriage?
No need to be delicate, Detective.
Cora's dream was to have a home by the sea.
I bought us a cottage I found on the tip of Cape May.
And we were going to leave as soon as possible.
Just... it wasn't soon enough.
I loved Cora, deeply.
I never let a day go by without telling her.
It's cold comfort, but at least I didn't make that mistake.
I've just received word back from Montreal.
What's that, then?
It's a sample of the fire-bomb fuels collected from the carpet in the brothel.
I'm hoping that by identifying them, it might lead us to the killer.
And how do you propose to do that?
Specific gravity.
Much like separating cream from milk.
I'll have to send it to the university, however.
I would do it myself, but I don't have a centrifuge.
Oh, that's a shame.
Anyway, back to Montreal.
It seems there were two rather nasty garrote attacks on prostitutes there.
One of the victims survived.
Went by the name of Cora Devereaux.
So we have a prostitute running from a killer.
Comes to Toronto to hide.
But her past comes calling.
Sir, might I interrupt?
Yes, George.
Have you news on the case?
You could say that.
Sir, I believe we have our murderer.
You're leaping to conclusions, George.
I don't think so, sir.
He's left us a confession.
Mr. Webster suffered cerebral edema.
He was obviously cyanotic.
And I found petechiae on his skin and in his eyes.
The cause of death was asphyxiation.
So your findings are consistent with a suicide?
That troubles you?
Something about this crime just isn't sitting right with me.
Well, I can run further tests if you like.
I would appreciate that.
Was there something else?
Yes.
I was wondering if you would have dinner with me tonight.
Oh, certainly.
I-I'm not sure that the results will be back by then.
Well, there are other matters we could discuss.
Current events.
Past events.
Constable Crabtree's remarkably untidy --
Well, I...
I'd be delighted.
Good.
Very good.
Mr. Beecher, I thought I should inform you personally before the newspapers publish.
We've shut down the Music Academy.
The details are all there for you.
Very good, Inspector.
So this Mr. Webster hanged himself.
That's right.
And a confession written in paint found by his side?
Near the body, yes.
What of Judge Wilson?
He's still in custody, but I'm sure he'll be exonerated.
I should think there must be some charge for him.
Solicitation, perhaps?
Yes.
Well, there are unfortunate vagaries in the laws.
Of course there are.
You must be quite pleased, Inspector.
This worked out quite well for you.
I'm not sure I appreciate what you're insinuating, Mr. Beecher.
Then let me be clear.
The Temperance League will change this city.
Mark my words.
Drink and loose morals will be a thing of the past.
Next time -- and there will be a next time -- the rich and powerful might not be so lucky.
And perhaps neither will the constabulary.
Yes.
Well, thank you for stopping by.
I'll see you out.
Hello, Miss Weston.
- Spare me your false sanctimony.
- Miss Weston --
If I've offended you in any way --
You come into my business, proselytizing like some preacher about how you're acting in the interests of women.
Well, you turned every one of them onto the street.
They had protection and medicine and clothing.
And now they have nothing.
Whatever happens to them is on your head.
Miss Weston, perhaps I could get you a cup of tea in the detective's office?
Thank you, Constable.
The poor woman.
I don't think we've been formally introduced.
Detective William Murdoch.
Who might you be?
Levi Beecher.
It's a pleasure.
Change is coming.
Spread the good word.
I'm sorry, William, I caused a scene.
But I cannot abide that man's hypocrisy.
It's quite all right, Ettie.
I need you to tell me more about the nature of the relationship between Miss Devereaux and Arthur Webster.
He referred to her exclusively as Miss Devereaux, did he not?
Always.
Then why would he write, "Forgive me, Cora,"
at the scene of his death?
I have no idea.
So let me try to understand this.
You don't think Arthur Webster killed himself because he wrote "Cora" instead of "Miss Devereaux"
on his suicide note.
Which apparently is no longer a suicide note.
That's my thinking, yes.
Did it ever occur to you that maybe he ran out of room?
Miss Devereaux is quite a long name to write.
- Sir.
- Bloody hell, Murdoch.
I thought we had this all wrapped up.
There is also no connection to Montreal, sir.
I'm gonna have that bloody temperance bastard breathing down my neck again.
So we're dealing with a double murder, is that it?
Not necessarily.
The two cases may not be related.
Not related?
Our prime suspect was found hanging by a suicide note bearing our victim's name.
Sir, we have nothing to connect the two cases.
And until we do, it would behoove us to treat them separately.
So let's start with Miss Devereaux.
If Webster didn't kill her, then who the bloody hell did?
Perhaps the man who stood the most to gain from her death.
The judge's son.
Cora did stand in the way of his inheritance.
And he's the one who brought us the man's bloody clothing to begin with.
What are you thinking?
Could I get you a spot of something to take the edge off?
A Pimm's and lemonade would be nice.
Yes.
Well, I think you might have to make do with tea.
Higgins!
Tea!
We'd like to speak to you about your father.
Judge Wilson has always been a very great friend to the Toronto police force.
He's often spoken very highly of the constabulary's fine work.
Which is why we were so glad to find another suspect.
I see.
And due to the overwhelming evidence against this suspect, we may soon be able to release your father.
Why, that is terrific news.
Now, this doesn't entirely clear your father's name.
Not yet.
We still have to clear up some minor details, such as, did the suspect have the ability to build a fire bomb?
Or the means.
And we have to find the materials or some evidence of him having had such materials.
I see.
But the point is this, Mr. Wilson.
We think very soon your father's good name will be cleared.
I can't tell you how relieved I am to hear this.
Inspector, Detective, the constabulary's diligence in this matter will not go unnoticed.
We certainly hope not.
I'll see you out.
- George.
- Sir?
The trap has been set.
Sir.
Just put it in the carriage.
You know which one -- the one without the horses.
Careful with that.
That was delicious, William.
Peanut butter and jelly.
Who would have thought?
I thought the occasion called for something special.
I never took you for a gourmet.
William?
You seem preoccupied.
Is something wrong?
Oh.
Well, here we are, you and I.
Yes?
And I must apologize.
I can't help my thoughts returning to the case.
Perhaps we should just discuss it, then.
After all, I find it as fascinating as you.
Well, good.
Good.
Um...
All along I've suspected that the judge is incapable of murder.
But?
But there is another possibility.
The two had been drinking absinthe.
Perhaps the wormwood in it caused him to become violent.
Studies of wormwood's properties say hallucination is a possible effect of the thujone in it.
Yet other studies state the opposite.
Everyone's physiology is as unique as their eyes.
Exactly.
So there really is no way of knowing for certain how it would affect an individual.
Doctor, how would you feel about an experiment?
An experiment?
Yes.
I'd been saving it for later.
But with all of this talk of absinthe, I thought it apropos.
William, I've never known you to drink.
Only on special occasions.
And this is one?
Yes.
Well, that would be delightful.
And now it could serve a double purpose.
All in the name of science, of course.
Of course.
Come on in.
Well, I am disappointed.
Hm?
Not one green fairy.
Disappointed?
William, we can't have that.
William, I think we should talk about where this is heading.
I'm very happy with where I am, thank you.
No, that wasn't what I meant.
Oh?
Y-Yes.
Oh.
Mrs. Kitchen doesn't usually allow visitors.
Oh.
No.
Oh.
No.
I was talking about precautions.
Precautions?
Yes.
I mean, do you have anything?
Oh, you mean...
Yes.
Prophylactics.
Oh, I didn't think I'd be needing any.
Yes, we do, William.
We -
- We really, really do.
How very modern of you.
There will be other chances.
But for tonight, saner heads must prevail.
For tonight.
All right.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
George.
Oh, sir.
I'm sorry.
- I must have nodded off...
- Shh, shh.
...writing up my report.
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm fine.
I guess we both had a long night.
What did you find out on your surveillance?
Well, sir, it seems Paul Wilson took the bait entirely.
Here's the list of items he purchased directly after your meeting.
Well, I guess we just wait.
And not for long, apparently.
Mr. Wilson.
Ah, Detective.
I desperately hope this is nothing, but I knew my conscience wouldn't rest if I didn't bring it to your attention.
- What is it?
- Well, I happened to be in the gardening shed this morning to repair a shuttlecock,
- and I found some items.
- I see.
And would these items include kerosene, turpentine, and some torn pieces of cloth?
Why, yes.
This is absurd.
I was trying to help you.
Mr. Wilson, you've been trying to frame your father ever since you walked into this station with his bloody clothing.
That is slanderous.
You've been spending your inheritance, throwing lavish parties as if you were never expecting him to return.
I needed to take my mind off my father's incarceration.
And now you volunteer evidence to us you yourself acquired.
I found those items.
Mr. Wilson, I had you followed.
My constables observed you purchasing these items yesterday.
Now, not only are you guilty of trying to frame your father, but you murdered Miss Devereaux as well.
Murdered?
You knew that if she lived, she would stand in the way of your inheritance.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, this is a nightmare.
No, I-I swear to you, I didn't kill her.
Enough, Mr. Wilson.
Please tell me the truth.
My father detests me.
He belittles my artistic aspirations.
He derides my taste in friends.
I have suffered indignity after indignity.
So yes, I want my father's fortune.
All of it.
After all, it's rightly mine.
You would watch your father hang so you could live out your gadabout life?
I-I didn't think he'd actually hang for it.
That's what happens when a man is convicted of murder, Mr. Wilson.
Luckily, it appears the noose will be fitted to the proper neck.
I didn't kill her.
I didn't.
You have to believe me.
I would never --
I would never have the gumption to actually kill anyone.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're making a mistake.
You're making a terrible mistake!
Hello, Father.
Hello, son.
So the little bugger framed his father, but you don't think he killed Miss Devereaux?
Why would he buy fire-bomb supplies if he already had them?
Good point.
Besides, I fear he may be right.
He doesn't have the gumption, let alone the competence, to kill.
So we're back to where we were.
Not quite.
I conducted a personal experiment last night with absinthe.
You?
Looking for little green fairies?
You're having me on, Murdoch.
I only wish, sir.
However, the experiment did prove to be quite beneficial.
Oh.
Keep up the good work.
Good morning, Julia.
William.
How do you feel?
My mind is elated, but my body seems to be in a state of rebellion.
Well, we did consume the better part of a bottle of absinthe last night.
However, the experiment portion of our evening was not a complete failure.
How so?
We drank far more absinthe than the judge and Cora.
In fact... here's the bottle from her room.
Far less indeed.
Then why were they so much more affected?
Are you suggesting that something might have been added to the absinthe they drank?
It would explain why the victim showed no signs of struggle.
She was unconscious.
And why the judge was so disoriented.
Could it have been laudanum?
Possibly.
Why?
I just received Arthur Webster's toxicology results.
And there was laudanum in his blood?
So much so that I suspect he was unconscious when he hanged himself.
I'll run some tests on the absinthe right away.
And I'll find out where the bottle came from.
Oh.
Um...
Good morning.
Morning.
The bottle came in a delivery package for Cora with her favorite flowers and French perfume.
It was sitting in a basket on her night table when I came.
She thought I'd sent it.
Well, he was always lavishing her with exotic gifts, so I just assumed it was Judge Wilson.
She was so happy with it,
I didn't want to tell her it wasn't from me.
She loved absinthe.
She said the wormwood would give us the most delicious visions.
But all it did was put me to sleep.
So whoever sent the absinthe knew that Cora had a taste for it.
As well as for flowers and perfume.
They must have had a history.
Montreal again.
Most likely.
And now you believe this same person killed Arthur Webster?
Yes.
We found a partial fingermark on a piece of glass from the fire bomb.
Note the occluded swirl just off-center.
We found another fingermark on a glass at Arthur Webster's house.
Not his.
Note the same occluded swirl.
So whoever threw the fire bomb was at Arthur's house.
Yes.
And Dr. Ogden has confirmed that Cora's absinthe bottle was laced with the same drug that was found in Arthur Webster's body.
So the same man was responsible for both murders.
What did I tell you?
Yes, but we now have the evidence to prove it.
So who is he?
- I have no idea.
- Bloody hell.
Sir, we'll find him.
We have a fingermark, and we're still compiling evidence.
Sir!
You said you wanted this as soon as it arrived.
- It's from the university.
- What's that, then?
It's the test results on the carpet water.
They found two combustibles.
Kerosene and turpentine.
Not turpentine.
Toluene.
Toluene?
- Never heard of it.
- Neither have I.
Why does that not surprise me?
You're not likely to unless you work in industries that manufacture rubber, do electroplating.
And I don't.
And neither do any of our suspects.
Apparently, it's also used for lubricating printing presses.
Printing presses.
Change is coming.
Spread the good word.
I met her at a brothel on Berger Street.
She let me do things to her.
Things even I didn't know I was capable of.
I kept going back until --
Until you almost killed her.
I didn't realize how ill I was.
That's when I came here.
But every city has its temptations.
And I knew if I fell into my old ways, the illness would take hold.
And how to avoid that?
The Temperance League?
Doing their good work was my salvation.
But then you saw Miss Devereaux again.
At the Music Academy.
I was handing out pamphlets.
She recognized me, of course.
And I knew she would undo everything.
So you chose to undo her instead.
What choice did I have?
Killing her was my only hope of killing that thing inside of me.
However, you had a problem.
Miss Devereaux knew that if she left the Music Academy, you'd be waiting.
I had to get in.
I studied the comings and goings until I figured out how.
That's when you sent the absinthe bottle, knowing she was partial to it.
It should have been simple.
She should have just been lying there.
But he was with her.
And Arthur Webster?
I'd seen him come to the brothel several times.
When your inspector said the suspect was an artist, well...
I put two and two together and paid him a visit.
So you gave us a nice, tidy way to wrap up our investigation.
You know, Detective, when I went to the Music Academy, I...
I really just went to help those girls.
Really.
Why didn't Cora tell me about Beecher?
I'd have protected her.
Or is that why she finally said yes to me?
Just to help her get away again.
I have no doubt that Cora's feelings for you were genuine, Your Honor.
How could you know that?
Because she could have just run away.
But she chose to be with you.
You were the one who was going to take her to safety.
If only we left when we had the chance.
Why did I wait?
Miss Weston.
I've come to say goodbye, William.
You're leaving?
I was thinking of Winnipeg.
Winnipeg?
I have a little money saved.
Perhaps I'll put my skills to use and open a small café.
And is this a café where coffee is sold, much like the piano lessons were at your Music Academy?
You could always come to see for yourself, if ever you're in Winnipeg.
But that's unlikely now, isn't it?
It is now.
Good luck, Ettie.
Julia, I have something to tell you.
Yes?
Last night, what happened between us --
It should never have happened.
Oh.
Well, I--
Oh.
Uh, what I mean to say is that I shouldn't have waited so long to share my feelings towards you.
Well, William, you should know that you're not the only one that lives inside their head.
No?
No.
Well, perhaps another picnic is in order, then?
Well, that would be splendid.
Without a visit from the green fairy this time.
I think that would be wise.
Murdoch Mysteries S02E05
Excuse me.
Get out!
Go!
Get out!
Where's Cora?
Did you see Cora?
Did anybody see Cora?
Cora?
!
What have we, George?
The fire started around midnight, sir.
And the cause?
An incendiary device was thrown through this window.
Glass.
Housed in a bottle, it would seem.
Gather up all the shards.
See if we can raise fingermarks.
Some may have survived the fire.
What else?
The madam couldn't find one of her... employees.
Mm-hmm.
She went to look for her in her room.
Where she found the victim.
Exactly.
Right, then.
Nothing's to be touched.
I want a list of everyone that was here tonight.
The girls, their customers -- everyone.
Oh, sir, that list could include the mayor, a bishop.
I mean, this was, after all, the Music Academy.
It could include the chief constable himself.
I want that list.
Sir.
The body's up this way.
This is how the madam found her.
Good Lord.
It's a horrible wound.
She appears to have been garroted.
Do we know her name?
Cora Devereaux, age 23.
Letters from admirers.
It appears Miss Devereaux was a very popular woman.
Perhaps it had something to do with her taste in fine spirits.
- Ab-sinthe.
Ab-seenthe?
- Absinthe.
It's a liquor popular in Europe amongst the intelligentsia.
Made with an herb -
- Wormwood.
Said to cause hallucinations.
Hallucinations?
How intriguing.
- Anything else, George?
- No, sir.
That's all the madam would tell me.
Oh?
Was she being uncooperative?
Well, sir, she said she wanted to give the rest of her statement to you personally.
Really?
Where is she now?
Right here, William.
It's good to see you again.
Always a pleasure, Miss Weston despite the circumstances.
I've always looked after my girls.
Arranged doctors, kept their bellies full, advised on affairs of the heart.
I didn't do a very good job with Cora, I'm afraid.
What can you tell me about her?
Not much.
She was in high demand with my customers, even though she'd only been here a short while.
Oh?
How long?
About six months.
And where was she before that?
- Montreal.
- What brought her here?
I believe she had a spot of trouble.
What kind of trouble?
A violent customer.
Had she any difficulties with customers here?
One.
Arthur Webster.
The painter?
He'd become obsessed with her.
In my experience, that can only lead to trouble.
I see.
He refused to leave tonight, so I had him removed.
Tonight?
When was this?
Around 10:00.
Two hours before you discovered Miss Devereaux's body.
He could have returned, killed her, and set fire to the house to cover his tracks.
Except I keep the doors locked at all times.
Security is very important for my girls and my clients.
Perhaps he found a way to sneak in.
Well, I suppose that's possible.
Well, I think that's enough for now, Miss Weston.
Thank you.
William.
In all these years, you haven't changed.
Not a bit.
And you, Ettie.
You've done very well for yourself.
Ah.
Doctor.
Detective.
May I ask why such a pretty dress for a murder?
Oh.
A gentleman asked me to dinner.
Oh?
Yes.
A rather stuffy accountant, as it turns out.
He was busy explaining the difference between single- and double-entry bookkeeping when I was called away.
The garrote appears to have severed both the carotid artery and the jugular vein.
So the killer would have been covered in blood?
Not necessarily.
The attack appears to have been from behind, meaning he would have avoided most of the blood spray.
This is most interesting.
What is it?
There's another scar winding around her neck suggesting a previous attempt to garrote the victim.
As though someone returned to finish a job they had already started.
Well, this is a right cock-up.
What have you got there?
What does this smell remind you of, sir?
Mineral spirits?
More specifically, turpentine.
Mm.
Fuel used in the fire bomb, was it?
One of them.
Likely the accelerant.
To light something heavier.
Kerosene more than likely.
At least that's what they taught us in the regiment.
So the killer chucks it in through the window, hoping to cover his tracks.
But the bomb was poorly constructed.
Caused more smoke than fire.
Many lives were spared.
Do we know which of the city fathers were caught with their strides down?
- Strides?
- Trous--
Uh, pants, pants.
Yes.
I have a list.
Mm.
Bloody hell, Murdoch.
Don't let this out of your sight.
We're not gonna be able to keep what happened out of the press, but at least we can try and limit the damage.
There's quite a few friends of the department on here.
Yes.
I'll try to ensure discretion.
Do we have a suspect?
Yes.
A painter with a jealous obsession.
Miss Devereaux... dead?
It can't be.
I'm sorry to have to inform you, Mr. Webster.
Turpentine.
To clean my brushes.
What of it?
We believe it was used to set the fire.
But surely you don't think that I had something to --
Mr. Webster, you had to be forcibly removed from the brothel last night.
Sometimes I find it difficult to leave Miss Devereaux.
Surely you've felt the same way towards a love.
Where did you go afterwards?
I came here to paint.
I am... was always so inspired after being with her.
She was my muse.
You were obsessed with her.
So much so that you couldn't stand the thought of other men being with her.
I had already accepted that situation, as unfortunate as it was.
Unfortunate?
Yes.
Her heart belonged to another.
I'm sorry to disturb you at your home, Judge Wilson, but as I mentioned, this is an urgent matter.
I'm sorry I haven't much time.
My caseload lately is very heavy.
Yes.
I'll try to be brief.
Are you familiar with the Weston Music Academy?
No, I am not.
Should I be?
It's a brothel, sir.
A young woman was murdered there last night.
I see.
Most unfortunate.
Sir, I believe you were a client of the victim's.
Are you suggesting that I frequent brothels, Detective?
With all due respect, sir, you were mentioned by name.
Well, many people would like to see me removed from the bench.
This is probably some ploy to discredit me.
Where were you last night?
I was working late in chambers.
And then I returned home.
What time?
About 10:00.
I had a small glass of sherry, and then I went to bed.
And you remained here at home the whole night?
You're quite certain?
I think I would know if I'd gotten out of bed, don't you?
Now, if there's nothing further, Detective, I'm needed in court.
Inspector.
There's a gentleman from the Temperance League to see you.
A Mr. Beecher.
Beecher?
Bollocks.
And there you go, sir.
Send him in.
- Go on in.
- Thank you.
Inspector, the Temperance League is no longer simply concerned with the evils of drink.
All of society's woes require our attention.
So the missus has told me, Mr. Beecher.
In particular, it's the houses of ill fame and the plight of the women in them that concern us.
Same goes for the police.
Well, so you say.
And yet, Inspector, for some time, the entire constabulary, yourself included, has tolerated the existence of the Music Academy because it caters to the city's elite.
You and I both know that that place is first-class.
Those lasses are well looked after.
Are they?
Perhaps Miss Devereaux's parents would disagree.
Inspector, on behalf of the thousands of Temperance League members, staunch supporters of our cause, like your wife,
I demand that place be shut down immediately.
You can tell your members that the police are doing their job.
In fact, we already have a suspect.
- Oh?
- Yes.
An artist.
An artist.
I see.
Somewhat convenient, Inspector, but a suspect nonetheless, huh?
- What are you implying, sir?
- I'm not implying.
I'm merely noting that of all the powerful people in that brothel, a lowly artist is the suspect.
Facts do not lie, sir.
Of course they don't.
Inspector, the Temperance League will be watching the progress of this case.
If justice is not served, you will be hearing from us.
I can't wait.
I would place time of death roughly around midnight.
Consistent with when the fire broke out.
The stomach contents revealed nothing out of the ordinary, except that she'd had an aperitif shortly before she was murdered.
Anise-based, I believe.
There was a bottle of absinthe in the room.
Oh?
The green fairy.
Green fairy?
Yes, the inspiration of many a poet.
Some say she can be seen after drinking it.
Or overindulging in it.
It's a most exotic drink.
No doubt supplied by your friend, the madam.
How did you two meet?
A church function, perhaps?
Actually, we met during a case.
Her friend Alice Black, also a prostitute, was murdered.
Oh.
Fortunately, I managed to save Ettie -- Miss Weston's life.
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to imply --
I also misjudged Miss Weston when I first met her.
Were there any defensive wounds?
There would have been no time to struggle.
Death would have been almost instantaneous.
There was this, however.
Mm.
Any idea how she got those scars?
A whip or a lash, I should think.
I've heard that those can be used in sex play.
Yes.
These scars are very nasty, though.
I don't think there was any play involved.
No, I suppose not.
Listen.
She was a doxy.
She did things for money, and some people pay for pain.
Might explain how she got that older scar on her neck as well.
I highly doubt she would let someone do that to her, no matter the price.
She did allow herself to be put in a vulnerable position, allowing men to put things around her neck and so on.
She wouldn't have noticed the garrote until it was too late.
Something happened to her in Montreal.
I have a mate on the force there.
He might be able to tell us a bit more.
Sir, there's someone here to see you.
I'm Detective William Murdoch.
Yes.
I'm Paul Wilson, His Honor's son.
Ah, yes.
Of course.
Mr. Wilson, how can I help you?
Well, this is rather difficult, and I fear that it may implicate my father in something unseemly.
But if I'm not mistaken,
Father told you he didn't go out last night, did he not?
That's correct.
Well, I remember waking in the middle of the night, and I heard someone come into the house.
There was a lot of commotion, banging and whatnot.
Did you investigate?
This is very difficult for me.
It was Father.
You're certain?
He's recently taken to coming in at all hours of the night.
Mm.
I see.
I'll be sure to look into this.
Unfortunately, there's more.
I...
I feel terrible about this.
I found these in the rear of his wardrobe.
I'll ask you one more time, Judge Wilson.
How did you get the bloodstains on your clothes?
I couldn't tell you.
You'll have to forgive me, Your Honor, but you're not being forthcoming.
I'm telling you what I know.
You also told me you never left your home.
I just... don't know what happened.
How can that be?
Either you left your home or you didn't.
Such a damn muddle, I can barely remember a thing.
Let me help you.
You went to the brothel.
You saw Miss Devereaux.
Yes.
Cora.
What time was this?
About 11:00.
And then what?
I...
I must have dozed off.
We'd been drinking, and when I woke there was blood, and she was there beside me dead.
And the next thing I know, I was in front of my door at home.
And you have no idea how you got there?
- No.
- Yet you had the good sense to remove the bloodstained clothing.
Yes, I suppose so, yes.
But I didn't kill her.
Of this, I am certain.
How can you be?
You don't seem certain of anything else.
Have you ever been in love?
Deeply and profoundly in love?
I have.
Well, then you understand when I tell you that, no matter how confused I am,
I-I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Cora.
Why else would I have asked her to be my bride?
He's gone completely daft.
A judge just can't up and marry some scarlet woman.
He'd be throwing away his career.
According to the judge, they were very much in love.
Love.
Ha!
The only thing she loved was his money.
And I think the judge finally realized that as well.
You think he discovered Miss Devereaux was a gold digger.
And in a blind rage, killed her.
How could he have been in her room and thrown the fire bomb at the same time?
That's a good point.
And for that matter, why not just set fire to the bed with her in it?
Why not, indeed.
The killer wasn't trying to cover up his crime.
He threw the fire bomb to create a diversion.
And in the confusion, slips in, goes upstairs, kills Miss Devereaux.
Bloody diabolical.
But then why is the judge still alive?
Perhaps someone wanted us to think that he was the killer.
Then again, maybe the judge had a partner, and this is all just a wild theory.
Seems we've got nothing but questions.
Why am I here, William?
You know very well why you're here.
The judge was in Miss Devereaux's room, wasn't he?
I'm sorry.
Tell me what happened.
And I want the truth this time.
Very well.
Cora?
!
I went to Cora's room, looking for her, just as I told you.
When I opened the door, I saw him... holding her crying.
The building was burning, so I helped him out, and I had him taken home.
Even though he murdered one of your own girls?
He did not murder Cora.
How can you be certain?
You found him over the body.
If you know anything about me, William, it's that I'm an expert on men.
You won't deny that it's useful to have a judge in your pocket.
You trusted me in the past when so many wouldn't.
Trust me now.
Very well.
In the past, Miss Devereaux was involved with customers who enjoyed the lash.
Am I correct?
Yes, in Montreal.
And did she have any clients here with that certain proclivity?
One.
- The judge?
- No.
Of course not.
Then who?
What's the meaning of this?
I searched the rest of your house and found these in your bedside table.
What was the nature of your relationship with Miss Devereaux?
Miss Devereaux... dominated, disciplined me.
You couldn't possibly understand.
Oh, I think I understand you fully.
You enjoyed being humiliated.
Or at least you thought you did... until Miss Devereaux decided to marry the judge.
That was too much humiliation for even you to endure.
My wanting to kill Miss Devereaux is as unlikely as the judge wanting to.
You don't think he had reason?
I had only respect for the way he treated Miss Devereaux.
Now, his son -
- That is a completely different story.
His son?
Miss Devereaux had ordered me to accompany her to an opening at the art gallery.
Young Mr. Wilson approached her, accused her of being after his father's money, was insulting and so furious I actually feared he would strike her.
I was about to put him in his place, but Miss Devereaux commanded me not to.
I see.
Mr. Wilson.
That's quite a contraption.
Yes!
Isn't it?
An electric carriage.
One of the first in the city.
Mm.
Do you own it?
Well, I'm considering it.
But frankly, it's difficult to get excited about anything, given what's happened to Father.
Unless you've come with good news?
There have been recent developments.
Wonderful.
Assuming it's something that will exonerate him.
I understand you had an extremely vitriolic exchange with the victim.
It was a heated argument, true.
But I was determined to protect Father.
Protect him?
From what?
From that woman dragging his good name through the mud.
She would have ruined him, professionally, socially.
Financially?
Well, that is what happens when one falls victim to an avaricious manipulator who's only after one's estate.
It certainly is.
Are you saying you suspect Paul?
His behavior makes me curious.
His behavior?
He had a heated argument with Miss Devereaux.
Paul did not take well to my decision to marry Cora.
And why not?
I've coddled Paul since his mother died.
He worshiped her.
And it's likely he thought he was defending her honor.
Perhaps.
Or perhaps he felt that his finances were being threatened by your impending marriage.
I don't see why he would feel that way.
I had my attorney draw up a contract leaving him half of my estate in the event of my death.
What if half wasn't enough?
Detective, my son's flaws are many.
He's a talented pianist who never plays.
He requires constant validation from friends who don't care for him.
He's never worked a day in his life.
But he's still my son.
I see.
If I may, how were you planning to deal with the... ramifications of your marriage?
No need to be delicate, Detective.
Cora's dream was to have a home by the sea.
I bought us a cottage I found on the tip of Cape May.
And we were going to leave as soon as possible.
Just... it wasn't soon enough.
I loved Cora, deeply.
I never let a day go by without telling her.
It's cold comfort, but at least I didn't make that mistake.
I've just received word back from Montreal.
What's that, then?
It's a sample of the fire-bomb fuels collected from the carpet in the brothel.
I'm hoping that by identifying them, it might lead us to the killer.
And how do you propose to do that?
Specific gravity.
Much like separating cream from milk.
I'll have to send it to the university, however.
I would do it myself, but I don't have a centrifuge.
Oh, that's a shame.
Anyway, back to Montreal.
It seems there were two rather nasty garrote attacks on prostitutes there.
One of the victims survived.
Went by the name of Cora Devereaux.
So we have a prostitute running from a killer.
Comes to Toronto to hide.
But her past comes calling.
Sir, might I interrupt?
Yes, George.
Have you news on the case?
You could say that.
Sir, I believe we have our murderer.
You're leaping to conclusions, George.
I don't think so, sir.
He's left us a confession.
Mr. Webster suffered cerebral edema.
He was obviously cyanotic.
And I found petechiae on his skin and in his eyes.
The cause of death was asphyxiation.
So your findings are consistent with a suicide?
That troubles you?
Something about this crime just isn't sitting right with me.
Well, I can run further tests if you like.
I would appreciate that.
Was there something else?
Yes.
I was wondering if you would have dinner with me tonight.
Oh, certainly.
I-I'm not sure that the results will be back by then.
Well, there are other matters we could discuss.
Current events.
Past events.
Constable Crabtree's remarkably untidy --
Well, I...
I'd be delighted.
Good.
Very good.
Mr. Beecher, I thought I should inform you personally before the newspapers publish.
We've shut down the Music Academy.
The details are all there for you.
Very good, Inspector.
So this Mr. Webster hanged himself.
That's right.
And a confession written in paint found by his side?
Near the body, yes.
What of Judge Wilson?
He's still in custody, but I'm sure he'll be exonerated.
I should think there must be some charge for him.
Solicitation, perhaps?
Yes.
Well, there are unfortunate vagaries in the laws.
Of course there are.
You must be quite pleased, Inspector.
This worked out quite well for you.
I'm not sure I appreciate what you're insinuating, Mr. Beecher.
Then let me be clear.
The Temperance League will change this city.
Mark my words.
Drink and loose morals will be a thing of the past.
Next time -- and there will be a next time -- the rich and powerful might not be so lucky.
And perhaps neither will the constabulary.
Yes.
Well, thank you for stopping by.
I'll see you out.
Hello, Miss Weston.
- Spare me your false sanctimony.
- Miss Weston --
If I've offended you in any way --
You come into my business, proselytizing like some preacher about how you're acting in the interests of women.
Well, you turned every one of them onto the street.
They had protection and medicine and clothing.
And now they have nothing.
Whatever happens to them is on your head.
Miss Weston, perhaps I could get you a cup of tea in the detective's office?
Thank you, Constable.
The poor woman.
I don't think we've been formally introduced.
Detective William Murdoch.
Who might you be?
Levi Beecher.
It's a pleasure.
Change is coming.
Spread the good word.
I'm sorry, William, I caused a scene.
But I cannot abide that man's hypocrisy.
It's quite all right, Ettie.
I need you to tell me more about the nature of the relationship between Miss Devereaux and Arthur Webster.
He referred to her exclusively as Miss Devereaux, did he not?
Always.
Then why would he write, "Forgive me, Cora,"
at the scene of his death?
I have no idea.
So let me try to understand this.
You don't think Arthur Webster killed himself because he wrote "Cora" instead of "Miss Devereaux"
on his suicide note.
Which apparently is no longer a suicide note.
That's my thinking, yes.
Did it ever occur to you that maybe he ran out of room?
Miss Devereaux is quite a long name to write.
- Sir.
- Bloody hell, Murdoch.
I thought we had this all wrapped up.
There is also no connection to Montreal, sir.
I'm gonna have that bloody temperance bastard breathing down my neck again.
So we're dealing with a double murder, is that it?
Not necessarily.
The two cases may not be related.
Not related?
Our prime suspect was found hanging by a suicide note bearing our victim's name.
Sir, we have nothing to connect the two cases.
And until we do, it would behoove us to treat them separately.
So let's start with Miss Devereaux.
If Webster didn't kill her, then who the bloody hell did?
Perhaps the man who stood the most to gain from her death.
The judge's son.
Cora did stand in the way of his inheritance.
And he's the one who brought us the man's bloody clothing to begin with.
What are you thinking?
Could I get you a spot of something to take the edge off?
A Pimm's and lemonade would be nice.
Yes.
Well, I think you might have to make do with tea.
Higgins!
Tea!
We'd like to speak to you about your father.
Judge Wilson has always been a very great friend to the Toronto police force.
He's often spoken very highly of the constabulary's fine work.
Which is why we were so glad to find another suspect.
I see.
And due to the overwhelming evidence against this suspect, we may soon be able to release your father.
Why, that is terrific news.
Now, this doesn't entirely clear your father's name.
Not yet.
We still have to clear up some minor details, such as, did the suspect have the ability to build a fire bomb?
Or the means.
And we have to find the materials or some evidence of him having had such materials.
I see.
But the point is this, Mr. Wilson.
We think very soon your father's good name will be cleared.
I can't tell you how relieved I am to hear this.
Inspector, Detective, the constabulary's diligence in this matter will not go unnoticed.
We certainly hope not.
I'll see you out.
- George.
- Sir?
The trap has been set.
Sir.
Just put it in the carriage.
You know which one -- the one without the horses.
Careful with that.
That was delicious, William.
Peanut butter and jelly.
Who would have thought?
I thought the occasion called for something special.
I never took you for a gourmet.
William?
You seem preoccupied.
Is something wrong?
Oh.
Well, here we are, you and I.
Yes?
And I must apologize.
I can't help my thoughts returning to the case.
Perhaps we should just discuss it, then.
After all, I find it as fascinating as you.
Well, good.
Good.
Um...
All along I've suspected that the judge is incapable of murder.
But?
But there is another possibility.
The two had been drinking absinthe.
Perhaps the wormwood in it caused him to become violent.
Studies of wormwood's properties say hallucination is a possible effect of the thujone in it.
Yet other studies state the opposite.
Everyone's physiology is as unique as their eyes.
Exactly.
So there really is no way of knowing for certain how it would affect an individual.
Doctor, how would you feel about an experiment?
An experiment?
Yes.
I'd been saving it for later.
But with all of this talk of absinthe, I thought it apropos.
William, I've never known you to drink.
Only on special occasions.
And this is one?
Yes.
Well, that would be delightful.
And now it could serve a double purpose.
All in the name of science, of course.
Of course.
Come on in.
Well, I am disappointed.
Hm?
Not one green fairy.
Disappointed?
William, we can't have that.
William, I think we should talk about where this is heading.
I'm very happy with where I am, thank you.
No, that wasn't what I meant.
Oh?
Y-Yes.
Oh.
Mrs. Kitchen doesn't usually allow visitors.
Oh.
No.
Oh.
No.
I was talking about precautions.
Precautions?
Yes.
I mean, do you have anything?
Oh, you mean...
Yes.
Prophylactics.
Oh, I didn't think I'd be needing any.
Yes, we do, William.
We -
- We really, really do.
How very modern of you.
There will be other chances.
But for tonight, saner heads must prevail.
For tonight.
All right.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
George.
Oh, sir.
I'm sorry.
- I must have nodded off...
- Shh, shh.
...writing up my report.
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm fine.
I guess we both had a long night.
What did you find out on your surveillance?
Well, sir, it seems Paul Wilson took the bait entirely.
Here's the list of items he purchased directly after your meeting.
Well, I guess we just wait.
And not for long, apparently.
Mr. Wilson.
Ah, Detective.
I desperately hope this is nothing, but I knew my conscience wouldn't rest if I didn't bring it to your attention.
- What is it?
- Well, I happened to be in the gardening shed this morning to repair a shuttlecock,
- and I found some items.
- I see.
And would these items include kerosene, turpentine, and some torn pieces of cloth?
Why, yes.
This is absurd.
I was trying to help you.
Mr. Wilson, you've been trying to frame your father ever since you walked into this station with his bloody clothing.
That is slanderous.
You've been spending your inheritance, throwing lavish parties as if you were never expecting him to return.
I needed to take my mind off my father's incarceration.
And now you volunteer evidence to us you yourself acquired.
I found those items.
Mr. Wilson, I had you followed.
My constables observed you purchasing these items yesterday.
Now, not only are you guilty of trying to frame your father, but you murdered Miss Devereaux as well.
Murdered?
You knew that if she lived, she would stand in the way of your inheritance.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, this is a nightmare.
No, I-I swear to you, I didn't kill her.
Enough, Mr. Wilson.
Please tell me the truth.
My father detests me.
He belittles my artistic aspirations.
He derides my taste in friends.
I have suffered indignity after indignity.
So yes, I want my father's fortune.
All of it.
After all, it's rightly mine.
You would watch your father hang so you could live out your gadabout life?
I-I didn't think he'd actually hang for it.
That's what happens when a man is convicted of murder, Mr. Wilson.
Luckily, it appears the noose will be fitted to the proper neck.
I didn't kill her.
I didn't.
You have to believe me.
I would never --
I would never have the gumption to actually kill anyone.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're making a mistake.
You're making a terrible mistake!
Hello, Father.
Hello, son.
So the little bugger framed his father, but you don't think he killed Miss Devereaux?
Why would he buy fire-bomb supplies if he already had them?
Good point.
Besides, I fear he may be right.
He doesn't have the gumption, let alone the competence, to kill.
So we're back to where we were.
Not quite.
I conducted a personal experiment last night with absinthe.
You?
Looking for little green fairies?
You're having me on, Murdoch.
I only wish, sir.
However, the experiment did prove to be quite beneficial.
Oh.
Keep up the good work.
Good morning, Julia.
William.
How do you feel?
My mind is elated, but my body seems to be in a state of rebellion.
Well, we did consume the better part of a bottle of absinthe last night.
However, the experiment portion of our evening was not a complete failure.
How so?
We drank far more absinthe than the judge and Cora.
In fact... here's the bottle from her room.
Far less indeed.
Then why were they so much more affected?
Are you suggesting that something might have been added to the absinthe they drank?
It would explain why the victim showed no signs of struggle.
She was unconscious.
And why the judge was so disoriented.
Could it have been laudanum?
Possibly.
Why?
I just received Arthur Webster's toxicology results.
And there was laudanum in his blood?
So much so that I suspect he was unconscious when he hanged himself.
I'll run some tests on the absinthe right away.
And I'll find out where the bottle came from.
Oh.
Um...
Good morning.
Morning.
The bottle came in a delivery package for Cora with her favorite flowers and French perfume.
It was sitting in a basket on her night table when I came.
She thought I'd sent it.
Well, he was always lavishing her with exotic gifts, so I just assumed it was Judge Wilson.
She was so happy with it,
I didn't want to tell her it wasn't from me.
She loved absinthe.
She said the wormwood would give us the most delicious visions.
But all it did was put me to sleep.
So whoever sent the absinthe knew that Cora had a taste for it.
As well as for flowers and perfume.
They must have had a history.
Montreal again.
Most likely.
And now you believe this same person killed Arthur Webster?
Yes.
We found a partial fingermark on a piece of glass from the fire bomb.
Note the occluded swirl just off-center.
We found another fingermark on a glass at Arthur Webster's house.
Not his.
Note the same occluded swirl.
So whoever threw the fire bomb was at Arthur's house.
Yes.
And Dr. Ogden has confirmed that Cora's absinthe bottle was laced with the same drug that was found in Arthur Webster's body.
So the same man was responsible for both murders.
What did I tell you?
Yes, but we now have the evidence to prove it.
So who is he?
- I have no idea.
- Bloody hell.
Sir, we'll find him.
We have a fingermark, and we're still compiling evidence.
Sir!
You said you wanted this as soon as it arrived.
- It's from the university.
- What's that, then?
It's the test results on the carpet water.
They found two combustibles.
Kerosene and turpentine.
Not turpentine.
Toluene.
Toluene?
- Never heard of it.
- Neither have I.
Why does that not surprise me?
You're not likely to unless you work in industries that manufacture rubber, do electroplating.
And I don't.
And neither do any of our suspects.
Apparently, it's also used for lubricating printing presses.
Printing presses.
Change is coming.
Spread the good word.
I met her at a brothel on Berger Street.
She let me do things to her.
Things even I didn't know I was capable of.
I kept going back until --
Until you almost killed her.
I didn't realize how ill I was.
That's when I came here.
But every city has its temptations.
And I knew if I fell into my old ways, the illness would take hold.
And how to avoid that?
The Temperance League?
Doing their good work was my salvation.
But then you saw Miss Devereaux again.
At the Music Academy.
I was handing out pamphlets.
She recognized me, of course.
And I knew she would undo everything.
So you chose to undo her instead.
What choice did I have?
Killing her was my only hope of killing that thing inside of me.
However, you had a problem.
Miss Devereaux knew that if she left the Music Academy, you'd be waiting.
I had to get in.
I studied the comings and goings until I figured out how.
That's when you sent the absinthe bottle, knowing she was partial to it.
It should have been simple.
She should have just been lying there.
But he was with her.
And Arthur Webster?
I'd seen him come to the brothel several times.
When your inspector said the suspect was an artist, well...
I put two and two together and paid him a visit.
So you gave us a nice, tidy way to wrap up our investigation.
You know, Detective, when I went to the Music Academy, I...
I really just went to help those girls.
Really.
Why didn't Cora tell me about Beecher?
I'd have protected her.
Or is that why she finally said yes to me?
Just to help her get away again.
I have no doubt that Cora's feelings for you were genuine, Your Honor.
How could you know that?
Because she could have just run away.
But she chose to be with you.
You were the one who was going to take her to safety.
If only we left when we had the chance.
Why did I wait?
Miss Weston.
I've come to say goodbye, William.
You're leaving?
I was thinking of Winnipeg.
Winnipeg?
I have a little money saved.
Perhaps I'll put my skills to use and open a small café.
And is this a café where coffee is sold, much like the piano lessons were at your Music Academy?
You could always come to see for yourself, if ever you're in Winnipeg.
But that's unlikely now, isn't it?
It is now.
Good luck, Ettie.
Julia, I have something to tell you.
Yes?
Last night, what happened between us --
It should never have happened.
Oh.
Well, I--
Oh.
Uh, what I mean to say is that I shouldn't have waited so long to share my feelings towards you.
Well, William, you should know that you're not the only one that lives inside their head.
No?
No.
Well, perhaps another picnic is in order, then?
Well, that would be splendid.
Without a visit from the green fairy this time.
I think that would be wise.
A prisoner shall at all times follow the rules and laws of the prisons and/ or regarding sentences.
Art. 15 of the Prison Law.
(Key turns in lock)
Come with me.
(Key turns in lock)
The guards issue folders outlining the laws we heed.
In your pamphlets you will find the house rules and other information.
Try to follow the rules.
Naturally.
-It's im-im-m-m-
Important?
-Jóhanna?
Can I have a word with you?
Not now, I'm busy.
For any questions, please talk to Friðjón here.
He oversees your hallway.
Wouldn't it be more natural if I talked directly to you?
No, you will talk to Friðjón.
(Georg sighs)
I can assure you that I will delve into this pamphlet, down to the last letter.
I will know it by heart.
That is a promise.
-That's not necessary.
In one week, you can quiz me on this pamphlet and I shall answer every question correctly!
I'm used to memorizing the written word.
I went to university both here and in Sweden.
I happen to have five-
-Here's your hallway, 3A.
Friðjón, you lead the way!
(Door buzzer) (Background conversation)
There are eleven of you here, one prisoner for every cell.
Yes, exactly.
Kenneth Máni here is the hallway manager.
Manager?
-He handles cleaning duties and guard liaisons.
Hello, Georg Bjarnfreðarson.
-Hi, welcome to the slammer.
Kenneth?
Where are you from?
-The United States...
Oh?
The empire of idiocy?
-No...just Washington.
Georg Bjarnfreðarson.
-Fúsi.
How do you like being here?
-It's wonderful.
11 of us locked in here together.
-No complaints.
Georg Bjarnfreðarson.
This is my friend, Daníel Sævarsson.
Daníel, introduce yourself.
Georg Bjarnfreðarson.
-Viggó.
I'll be off now.
-One moment, Jóhanna.
Shouldn't we get together for a chat over some tea?
Tea?
-Yes, so we can get to know each other better.
So that my time here can be constructive to us all.
Hey.
Ugly.
Why did you kill the broad?
I...
-Didn't you get to fuck her?
(Low laughter from everyone)
We are accountable for our own happiness.
We are the driving force in our own lives and everything we do, where does it come from?
Our minds.
Whatever we think, negative or positive, it sends off energy, and that energy is a driving force.
How do I want my life to be?
What house, car, spouse?
I think of the new Blackberry phone and send off the energy.
Where does it go?
(Knocks on table) It goes into the cosmos and like a boomerang, it comes back as... (makes boomerang noise) Hello future.
(Everybody claps)
Let's look at some random thoughts here.
Here we go.
A jep...?
Jeep!
Right, just pick a photo of the jeep...
The man wouldn't cry if it came on 44" tires.
Then you just pick a photo with those details.
A giant house with a pool and a...yak...?
-Jacuzzi.
No problem.
Just browse through housing magazines to find a good photo and send off the energy, and where does it go?
It goes into the cosmos.
(makes boomerang noise)
I don't get it how such shoddy work is tolerated.
"A hidden flaw", it was flooding everywhere,
I was standing in the living room with a pipe wrench.

Waist deep in water?
-You said it.
Waist deep in water?
-You said it.
Are you plumbers?
-He is.
I'm a mason.
Are you plumbers?
-He is.
I'm a mason.
I was, it's all ground to a halt now.
But you?
I was, it's all ground to a halt now.
But you?
I'm in the real estate business.
Isn't that all frozen?
-Frozen?
I haven't noticed.
Isn't it hard to get the money?
Isn't it hard to get the money?
They seem to get it somehow.
But I leave that to others.

It's all about impressions.
Snappy clothes and that.

(Cellphone rings)
Ólafur Ragnar, Plus Houses.
Yes, it's Olgeir here.
Are you wearing my suit?
No?
Why do you think that?
Your clothes are here on the floor!
Do you still have a key to our house?
What's with the negativity in the cosmos?
I had to borrow them.
I'm a realtor and they told-
You're no damn realtor.
Do you really think you can just come in here and take other people's clothes?
You can have them back this afternoon.
Your sister and I are going to a funeral at 2 o'clock and I was going in that suit!
-Is it right at 2 o'clock?
I have to show a flat at 1 o'clock so I'll-
OK, forget about giving them back, we'll change the locks.
I tried to call, (Phone hangs up) but I had no deposit...
So how are Bogga and the kids?
Everybody's fine?
Hello?
So, started cleaning right away I see... (Slams door)
Hi.
-Hello.
I came to give you the plan for cleaning and stuff.
Here are the times when people are to clean.
So you manage and assign the cleaning duties?
-Yes.
I couldn't help noticing how lack the cleaning is here.
Tell me, do you follow a work plan?
A work plan?
-For cleaning?
Do you have one?
No...it isn't complicated.
-Not complicated?
Proper handling of cleaning materials and solvents is a complex affair that requires great care.
There should be a detailed work plan available here.
Are you from the Faroe Islands?
-No.
Born and raised in Iceland.
Though I spent many a year in Sweden.
(giggling)
"Many a year..."?
Who talks like that?
There's the cell number that tells when it is your turn to do the cleaning.
-But wouldn't it be better to have the inmate's name, instead of his cell number?
I wouldn't know if it were names.
I can't read that good.
Dyslexia does not exist.
It is a fashion phenomenon invented by a German doctor in the 1960's and therefore it is not a real medical condition.
Are you fuckin' with me?
-No, I am not.
It's scientifically proven.
I don't fucking care about stuff like that!
I'm the boss here, not you, so you better learn this!
This is how prison works, you see.
It's not just me...
These are just rules and you obey them like all of us.
You'll have to be responsible for your life, you know...
Yeah.
And...right.
And...
How did you get this position as hallway manager?
I was just told to do it.
Do you get any special privileges with the job?
I like the pills, they give me more time with myself.
Yes, the Ritalin helps you-
-I have ADD.
Yes, I know.
But remember the last time you got out, you were determined never to go back into prison.
You were going to get a job.
But instead, you drove north to Akureyri and committed a burglary.
What did that teach you?
That burglaries...they're always found out.
That wasn't what I was getting at.
You weren't going to commit any more burglaries.
So what happened?
-I went up north...
But didn't you learn anything specific from this?
You weren't going to meet your friend, but you went anyway.
You weren't going to commit a crime, but you did anyway.
Oh yeah...
Never go back to Akureyri again.
Thank you Kenneth.
Þröstur?
Do you feel like participating...this time?
No.
Georg Bjarnfreðarson!
-Hi Georg.
Your father had a girl's name?
I don't have a father.
-So you've never known him?
Bjarnfreður Geirsdóttir is my mother.
You must know her, an educated woman such as yourself.
Wait, Bjarnfreður...
She sang that song... (Humming) "Today I am a woman"
-Exactly!
(Low laughter from everyone) That's her!
Welcome.
Would you like to introduce yourself?
.
Yes...
I'm Daníel...
Sævarsson.
-Hi Daníel.
Why are you here?
I'm not supposed to be here,
I'm only here because of him.
This man, he ruined my life.
(muttering to himself) That's a small misunderstanding...
(Door opens below)
Well hello!
Oh hi.
-Where's the rent?
Well, the man's been busy...
there's a lot going on...
Do you remember how much it was...?
-Do I?
I'm working with so many numbers as a realtor, that when I went to the bank, I forgot the amount.
You get a monthly invoice, it's always the same amount.
That's why it got stuck in the system, you see.
You are 3 months overdue, if you don't pay today, you'll have to leave.
-3 months...all at once?
Isn't that a little too much?
(Washing machines running in background)
(Washing machines running in background)
This isn't complex.
White on sixty.
Colored on forty.
This isn't complex.
White on sixty.
Colored on forty.
So how are you?
18 month stretch?
-Yeah.
So how are you?
18 month stretch?
-Yeah.
You'll get over it, if you keep yourself busy.
So you went to university?
-I never finished...
There aren't many educated souls around here.
I myself went to an Ants and Crafts school.
I've been meddling with drawing since I was little.
I've been meddling with drawing since I was little.
I've been dabbling a little myself...painting, that is.
Great.
Did you bring anything with you?
No, I didn't know you could do that.
Oh sure.
We have a facility here, an artshop.
We do?
-Yes, sonny...
Relax!
I'm not a bad guy.
Not any more than you are.
I'm sorry, it's just...
you startled me.
It's always strange to come to new places.
But you must keep your back straight.
You could use a little workout, build some muscle.
Life isn't over.
Consider your stay an opportunity.
Have you heard of Afstaða?
-No, what's that?
It's the Inmate's Rights Movement.
We could use someone on the board that can write.
Nah...
I just intend...
to keep to myself.
Those that work with the movement get prioritized.
Those that work with the movement get prioritized.
It can help you with parole hearings.
-Really?
Do you have my laundry?
-What's the number?
219.
Linoleum is a natural substance, you can't molest it with bleach-based cleaning fluids.
Every sane man knows this.
I-I-I-
-This has to stop at once.
The boy is not up to his job.
He knows nothing about cleaning or handling solvents.
I demand a meeting about this with the warden.
Jóhanna has a sch-sch-sch scheduled...
I know about her scheduled appointment hours.
But I want a special strategy session with her.
What will you say when she asks why the floor is ruined?
"Georg Bjarnfreðarson brought it up, but I ignored him."
I'll I-I-look into it.
-Thank you.
But on another note...are you going to Reykjavík by chance?
No-not today...
-But sometime soon?
Yes.
I usually go to Reykjavík on T-t-t...
Tuesdays?
-No, T-t-t..
Thursdays?
Good, I'd like to ask of you a small favor.
It so happens that for years I was a shift manager at a Shell gas station.
For 3 years I was never late, never missed a day from work and was never sick.
I asked them to make some sort of recognition of this fact.
The problem is that someone must go there in my name and pick it up in person.
Can you do this for me?
L-look, it's not a p-p-part of my-
I know that, but I'm asking for this as a personal favor.
My mother is sick, Friðjón.
I'm not gonna send her.
So, are you gonna go for it?
-I want to see it first.
3 o'clock would be good.
-Like, later today?
Yes.
-That's no problem.
Shall we meet in 30 minutes?
-That would be great.
(Video game noises)
(Frantic keyboard tapping) Kiddi?
-Be quick, I'm in the middle of a lap.
I think I'm about to close my first sale.
-I like!
He's looked it up on the net and everything.
I got this tingly vibe all over my body.
(Screams) I'm back on the checkpoint?
Damn it...
I was thinking...if I could get paid in advance?
I've never heard anyone say that before.
Just one...you!
I've told you about 80 times, complete the sale first.
Yeah, but this guy seemed so very interested.
-No!
But...
Twenty thousand?
It's almost guaranteed you know.
He was almost asking for the bank account number.
Signature and cash!
Signature and cash!
Capische?
Yeah, OK..that's only fair.
Nooo!
(Loud moan)
So, starting working out?
-Just warming up.
Straight back.
-Yeah.
Listen, I've been thinking about Afstaða, and I'm ready to give it a try...
-Now we're talking.
Ingvi!
I've told Daníel here about the secretary position, and he's interested.
-Can he be trusted?
Oh sure.
This is Ingvi, he's the chairman.
So Danny, what's your team in the English football?
I'm usually just called Daníel.
Is this some naming game?
What's your team, "Daníel"?
None in particular.
-There must be some team.
Everybody has a team.
-Just Liverpool, I guess.
Liverpool?
Are you fucking joking?
I don't watch football.
-No, clearly not.
Liverpool is a loser team.
We clearly have a problem.
You being a Liverpool man, me a Man.
United man.
What are you going to do about it?
Can't you just change teams?
-Sure, why not?
Then we're all United fans?
Everything's OK then?
Have you told him what this is all about?
-Roughly.
Yeah, it's no problem.
-Of course it is a problem.
You think that this problem just goes away?
Well, no...
I'm just fucking with you man!
Here, have some.
-No thanks.
You don't dip?
-I don't like it.
You don't dip and you don't watch football?
What do you do during the day?
I think 23 is too much.
Don't you think he'll settle for 21?
21 million?
Nobody's gonna say no to that.
Lower even. 19...18.
18?
I like that number.
-So you're taking it?
I think so, yeah.
-So you have the money with you?
I've talked to the bank.
-OK.
So can you pay the commission now?
-Commission?
I don't pay that.
I've been nothing but nice to you here.
I've shown you the place, and it's a way to go for me.
It's the seller that pays the commission.
I'm not a seller, I'm a buyer.
Aren't you a realtor?
Yes...you're right.
I'm reading you.
I need to make a call, can you hold on a sec?
Hello, Ólafur from Plus Houses.
I'm doing good, I'm here in the Hörðukór house.
I've sold the place.
-No, I never said...
He has the bills in the air.
So I was wondering if you could pay the commission today?
(Incomprehensible cursing)
Yes, that's all upcoming, I just need the money...
Can't you make an exception?
Listen, can you hold a moment?
Hey wait, I need a lift back!
(Incomprehensible cursing)
(Clears throat)
I made an unofficial survey on your work here...
And I believe that this hallway manager position may be too much for you.
My professional opinion is that you step aside, and that we look over things together, just like you do with Dr. Sigurlaug.
Where will I go?
-No, you would stay here.
I would guide you on how to do the cleaning duties.
You will clean for me?
-No, I would take on the responsibilities of the hallway manager, and you would be my right hand... an assistant hallway manager, so to say.
Can't I just keep doing my job?
Do you know how many university degrees I have?
Five.
I have five of them.
Psychology, sociology, political science, pedagogy and, teaching qualifications.
After careful consideration, I, Kenneth Máni Johnsson, have decided to immediately resign as hallway manager.
I have neither the mental faculty nor the experience to shoulder the responsibilities required of my position.
Furthermore, I fear that my lack of skill in handling cleaning fluids will cause damage to prison property, but after a careful review of my work with my friend,
Georg Bjarnfreðarson, I have seen paint damages appear in several places, resulting in ugly stains.
Georg Bjarnfreðarson has completed a course in general cleaning techniques, with special focus on linoleum flooring, see included attachment...
Did you write this?
Yeah, my man!
I'm not fucking with you!
You're declaring that you're afraid of harming yourself and others...while cleaning?
-Uhm...yeah?
Kenneth's decision is a surprise, but I admire his courage to confront his own weaknesses.
I will not shy away from these responsibilities and will happily accept the position.
(Fast footsteps approaching)
Dude, they'll find out.
Not if we stick to the story.
I don't know, Jack.
It could be a risk.
It's the only way.
We have to do this.
They're still at it, huh?
Look, we're running out of time.
We gotta make a decision now.
So are we all okay with this?
This is a decision that will affect the rest of our lives.
I'm not taking it lightly.
Kate?
Yeah.
Sun?
- Frank?
- What?
Sorry you got dragged into this, but we need to know that you're with us.
Whatever you guys decide, I'll just roll with.
Hurley, what about you?
I don't think we should lie, dude.
We need to protect the people that we left behind, Hurley.
How does lying protect them?
It protects them from Charles Widmore.
The guy hired a boatload of people to kill all of us.
He faked a plane crash.
I mean, do you think telling him the truth, he's just gonna- he's gonna leave them alone?
Look, he's your dad, right?
Can't you, like... call him off?
There's no calling my father off.
But he'll never find them.
I mean, the island disappeared.
We all saw it.
It's gone.
Bloop!
You think anyone's gonna believe that...
Believe any of it?
They're gonna think you're crazy.
Not if someone backs me up.
Sayid, come on.
They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth.
But what if we all do?
And if we can stick together, we can make them believe us.
I don't want to spend the rest of my life lying.
Do you?
No.
But...
I don't believe we have a better choice.
I'm sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.
You know what, dude?
I'm gonna remember this.
And someday, you're gonna need my help, and I'm telling you right now...
You're not gettin' it.
Wake up, Sayid!
Sayid!
Sayid, wake up!
Sayid!
No, no, no, no, no!
What do I do?
!
What am I supposed to do?
!
Okay, okay, okay.
Just stay calm.
What the hell were you thinking?
- Ana Lucia?
- You were driving like a maniac.
And why'd you pull over?
I just...
I
- I thought-
You didn't think.
What if I were real?
What if a real cop stopped you?
They already have pictures of you covered in blood,
- with a gun in your hand.
- Actually, it's ketchup.
We went to a-a drive-thru, and, uh...
Well, you need to pull it together.
- You've got a lot of work to do.
- I do?
Let's start with the basics.
First off, you need new clothes.
Then you need to go to a safe place.
And take Sayid to somebody you trust.
- You getting all this?
- Yeah.
Then get to it.
And stay away from the cops.
Do not get arrested.
Thanks, Ana Lucia.
Oh, yeah.
Libby says hi.
You really think that thing's gonna work?
Rose, I told you a hundred times.
Of course it's gonna work.
Yes.
I worked hard on it.
It's better than rubbing two sticks together.
Well, I heard that's what you're supposed to do with it.
Yeah?
Well, I think this is gonna work better, all right?
Well, I think you got too much wood here in the inside.
That's gonna smother the leaves.
Rose, if you don't have enough wood, the leaves just burn out.
Fire?
Who cares about fire?
Any minute the sky could light up, and who the hell knows what could happen this time?
Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control.
You are either gonna help or be quiet!
- Whose shirt is this?
- It's mine.
Can I have it?
What does it matter?
We're all gonna be dead by sundown.
I'll take that as a "yes, " frogurt.
- It's Neil.
- Yeah, yeah.
Still in one piece?
- As far as I can tell.
- I figured it would've disappeared with the rest of our stuff.
I guess whatever we had with us when we moved is along for the ride.
What?
Look who's back.
Welcome back, Dr. wizard.
- I think it's Mr. wizard.
- Shut up.
You've been gone for two hours.
What the hell were you doing?
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
I'm sorry.
I...
left my pack in the jungle and I was coming back and I-I-I just-it was a while before I realized that I was just...
uh, I was really lost.
Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?
- I don't know.
- Well, you at least got a plan?
I think we should take the zodiac, head to a shipping lane.
No.
No, no, no.
We can't just sail out on any course.
For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing, and, uh, to do that...
I need to determine where we are now... in time.
And what are the rest of us supposed to do?
I'm gonna go find us something to eat.
And how are you planning on doing that?
Don't worry about it.
I guess we'll get the water.
Dude, wake up!
Come on.
I can't do this on my own!
I promise I'll pay you back.
Wait right here.
Shih tzus?
I like shih tzus.
It looks like you "heart" them.
Rough night?
Yeah.
Your friend's pretty wasted.
Yeah.
I know you from somewhere, don't I?
- No.
- I think I do.
- Yeah, you definitely look familiar.
- I just have one of those faces.
You're lying.
I don't believe in lying.
I remember!
You're the guy who won the lottery...
And you crashed in that plane.
- No.
I must look like him.
- You're him.
Hey!
Buy a ticket here.
If you win, we get a commission.
You're good luck.
Sorry.
Wrong dude.
Keep the change.
Okay.
Okay, we're outta here.
Mommy, I wanna go home.
Look at your book, baby.
Hello?
I
- I can't believe it's you.
No.
Hi.
How are you?
Wait, you're in L.A.?
Of course I can meet, yeah.
What...
I know exactly where that is.
I'll be there in half an hour.
Mommy, where are we going?
To see a friend.
Are you looking for your pills, Jack?
I flushed them down the toilet.
Thank you.
I was just gonna do that myself.
Yeah, I figured you were.
Going somewhere?
I'm checking out.
Where are we going?
You're going home.
And find yourself a suitcase.
If there's anything in this life you want, pack it in there...
Because you're never coming back.
Good.
Good.
I'll pick you up in six hours.
And where will you be going?
John's casket is outside in a carpet van.
I need to move it somewhere safe.
Safe?
He's dead, isn't he?
I'll see you in six hours, Jack.
previously on "Exposé...
It looks like the scorpion is taking over
All the cobra's business.
You want me to work with tsunami,
- the dragon lady of van nuys?
- Yeah.
I'm here to capture the scorpion, so if you've got a problem with that, you can go work stage 3.
She's hit!
Hey, dad.
How's it going?
...the news?
No.
I just got up.
Why, are you wanted again?
Uh, yeah.
Kind of.
- Is mom here?
- No, she's out shopping.
Hey, set him over here.
- Oh, man, he's out.
- Is he... breathing?
Barely.
What happened?
- He got shot by a dart.
- A dart?
What, were you in the zoo or something?
- No, we were at the safe House.
- The safe House?
Sayid took me there to protect me.
Then these two guys jumped at him, they shot him with darts, and now he's - he's in a coma or... something.
Hugo, this doesn't make sense.
And what are you doing out of the mental institution?
Sayid pulled me out.
I'm in danger.
We both are.
Danger from who?
I'm not sure exactly.
Hello?
Mr. and Mrs. Reyes?
L.A.P.D. Can you open the gate, please?
Just what kind of trouble are you in?
Dad, please!
Just don't tell 'em I'm here!
All right, but then you're gonna tell me the truth.
Well, give us a call if you hear anything.
You killed three people?
- No.
Sayid did.
- Oh.
Well, that's better.
Come on.
Let's get him to the couch.
He saved me.
I think we should call a lawyer right now.
No, no, no.
We can't go public.
They're after us.
Who?
Who is after you?
I don't know.
Sayid knows.
He can explain.
Sayid ain't explaining nothing.
We need to get him to a hospital.
Did you not hear me?
People are trying to kill us.
We go to a hospital, they'll find us!
Like-like "The Godfather. " It's the last place you go.
Everyone knows it.
They - they smother you with pillows and make it look like an accident.
Sayid, please wake up!
That's not gonna work.
We need a doctor.
I think I know what to do.
Mommy, mommy, can I push the button?
Sure you can, sweetie.
But we're all the way to the top, okay?
So I want you to press number 3-1.
You see it?
You see it?
Okay.
You get it. 3-1.
Yeah!
That's the one!
You pressed it!
You pressed it!
Hi.
Hello, Kate.
Have a nice day.
I'll be right with you.
Hello, Ben.
If it's the porterhouse you're looking for, we're out.
No, no porterhouse.
I do, however, have something very important in my van, Jill, and I need you to watch it for me.
- Is it what I think it is?
- It is.
He'll be safe with me.
- Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in yet?
Yeah, everything's moving right on schedule.
- How's it going with Shephard?
- He's with us.
Really?
What'd you do, bribe him with some pills?
Cut the man some slack.
He's been through a lot.
We all have.
Right.
Of course.
Sorry.
So keep him safe, Jill.
Because if you don't... everything we're about to do... won't matter at all.
Oh, you got it!
You got it!
You got it!
- You got it.
You got it.
- All right!
Finally we got-
Why did you do that?
Because you're supposed to fan the flame, Rose.
I thought you said you knew how to start a fire.
And I thought you said you didn't care.
I care about surviving.
I think you need to take a time-out, Neil.
- You'll get it, Bernard.
You will.
- Yeah.
All right.
Just - just try again.
Give me one second.
I got you something.
I found these in the jungle.
- Look at that.
Thank you.
- There was only two, but I thought we could both do with a bite to eat.
Thank you very much, very much.
You all right?
I just can't seem to shake this bloody headache.
Well...
I'm sure it'll pass.
No, it's not just that.
It's the weirdest thing.
Earlier, I was...
I was thinking about my mom, and all of sudden, I-I couldn't remember her maiden name.
I mean, isn't that odd?
Don't worry about it.
Listen, all of us have been under a lot of stress.
Okay?
Daniel...
Do you know what's happening to me?
Dinner!
That's great!
Wow!
Where'd you get that?
I found it.
What do you mean you "found" it?
It died in the jungle.
I found it.
Don't worry.
It's fine.
It's only been dead three hours.
What?
Who's got a knife?
A knife?
You need a knife?
Oh, it's over by the Cuisinart next to the stove.
What's your problem?
My problem is, we don't have a knife.
W - we don't have anything.
And it wouldn't even matter if we did, 'cause Bernie the dentist can't even start a fire.
Hey, ease up there, Frogurt.
It's Neil, you inbred.
And I'm not gonna ease up, 'cause I'm tired and I'm hungry and I'm screwed!
- We're all screwed!
- Calm down, Neil.
We're gonna get through this.
How are any of us gonna get through this?
!
Did you hear what I just said?
!
We can't even get fire!
Run!
Come on!
Split up!
Everybody, get to the creek!
Ow!
Dan!
Keep moving!
- Come on.
He's dead.
- No...
Come on!
You wanna be dead, too?
!
Come on!
There's nothing you could have done.
We gotta go now!
Dude, the cops are on a stakeout?
You just escaped from a mental institution.
There's dead bodies everywhere!
Of course they're on a stakeout!
They think you're crazy enough to come back home.
S - so are you...
Crazy?
Do you think I am?
Well, either that or you're lying to me.
I'm not crazy, and I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.
Well, what is it?
Why is there a dead Pakistani on my couch?
!
He's not dead, ma.
Well, he's not breathing.
He's not?
!
It's okay, Carmen.
We have a plan.
A plan?
What are you talking about?
He is breathing... kind of.
Dad, we gotta go now.
Hugo, what's happening?
Mom, please!
No "mom, please" me!
Why are you all over the news?
Do you know what they are telling about you?
Yeah, mom.
I know.
Look, everything's gonna make sense.
I promise.
It better!
Officers.
So how long are you in L.A.?
Just a few days.
I have some business to attend to.
But I wanted to see you.
Here it is.
Her name's Ji Yeon.
Here's a baby picture.
Oh!
She's beautiful.
Thank you.
She's with her grandmother in Seoul.
I hope some day you get to meet her.
It would be nice to see her and Aaron play together.
Yeah.
Kate?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Are you?
Somebody knows we're lying.
What?
Some lawyers came to see me.
Who?
Two men.
They came to my House and they asked for a blood sample.
Some kind of lawsuit.
They wanted to test to see if...
To see if Aaron's my son.
Who did these lawyers represent?
I don't know.
They wouldn't tell me who their client is.
Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.
How do you know?
Because if they were, they would just do it.
They wouldn't come to you in private.
They don't care that we're lying.
They just want Aaron.
But who... who would do that?
We-
I don't know, but you need to take care of them.
What do you mean, "take care of them?"
Wouldn't you do anything you had to in order to keep Aaron?
What kind of a person do you think I am?
Jin!
Jin!
The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.
You get the baby on the chopper.
I'll get Jin.
Like you did on the freighter.
You told me to get on the helicopter, and you said you'd get Jin.
We gotta get outta here!
Sun, I hope you don't think...
But you did what you had to do.
And if you hadn't... we probably all would've died instead of just my husband.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I...
I don't blame you.
So...
How's Jack?
Hugo said I could trust you.
I wasn't so sure, but he swore I could, so...
Can I?
Yes.
Of course.
All right.
What happened to him?
Hugo said he got hit with some dart.
Must've been some drugs or something.
- And where is Hurley right now?
- At our House, freaking out.
Let me get my car.
Help me move him over.
I'm gonna have to get him to the hospital.
No.
No, H-Hugo said that whoever did this, they'll come back after him.
All due respect, Mr. Reyes, but you brought him to me, so I'm gonna do what I think is best for Sayid.
All right, fine.
Take him to the hospital.
But with all due respect to you, Dr. Shephard, when this is over, you're gonna do something for me.
What?
Stay away from Hugo.
Whatever it is you talked him into, something tells me you don't have his best interests at heart.
So stay away from my son.
Hello?
Ben...
You'll never guess who just showed up at my door.
Who?
Sayid.
Who is Sayid?
I thought he was your friend.
He is my friend...
But he's also got this double life where he does crazy ninja moves and spy stuff.
But he's a good guy.
A good guy doesn't kill three men.
A good guy doesn't kill any men.
- Mom.
- Don't "mom" me.
You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.
The news thinks you did this.
And if the news does, everyone does.
Why is this happening?
How can anybody want to hurt you?
I don't know.
Tell your mother the truth.
We lied, ma.
What do you mean, you lied?
All of us - the Oceanic Six, we lied about what happened after the crash.
And what did happen?
Okay.
See, we did crash, but it was on this crazy island.
And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue.
And there was a smoke monster, and then there were other people on the island.
We called them The Others, and they started attacking us.
And we found some hatches, and there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or...
Well, I was never really clear on that.
But...
The Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches.
That was the Dharma Initiative, but they were all dead.
The Others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us.
And then we teamed up with the Others, because some worse people were coming on a freighter.
Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us.
So we stole their helicopter and we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up.
And we couldn't go back to the island because it disappeared.
So then we crashed into the ocean, and we floated there for a while until a boat came and picked us up.
And by then, there were six of us.
That part was true.
But the...
But the rest of the people... who were on the plane,
they're still on that island.
I believe you.
I don't understand you, but I believe you.
A lot of people died, ma.
And now this bad stuff is happening because...
We shouldn't have lied.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just stepped on something.
Something jammed...
Son of a bitch.
We should keep moving.
We gotta hook up with everybody at the creek.
It's a long creek, James.
Which part?
I don't know.
The wet part.
Sorry if my plan's not up to others' Stan-
Who were those people?
Are they yours?
Did they shoot the arrows?
You want me to crawl out there and ask 'em?
You don't have to be a wiseass.
I'm just trying-
What are you doing on our island?
!
Son of a bitch.
Come on, Sayid.
Come on.
Sayid.
It-it's... it's Jack.
It's okay.
It's all right.
You're okay.
You're all right.
What happened?
You're fine.
You're in the hospital.
Hurley's father brought you to me.
Hurley's father?
Sayid, you've been attacked.
Where's Hurley?
He's at his parents' House.
Who's with him?
I don't know.
His mother, maybe?
Does anyone else know he's there?
Hello, Hugo.
Get away from me.
Get away!
Hugo, I know you're in trouble, and I can assure you I've taken care of everything.
I have a car waiting for us out back.
The police didn't see me come in.
I can get you out of here.
No way, dude.
Sayid warned me about you.
I'm taking you to Sayid.
He's with Jack.
That's why I'm here, Hugo.
Jack called me.
How else would I know that they're together?
No.
You're-you're playing one of your mind games.
They would never trust you.
In their defense, I'm not an easy person to trust.
But they came around when they realized that we all want the same thing.
And what's that?
To go back to the island.
Come with us, Hugo... and this'll be over.
You can stop hiding.
You can stop worrying about the stories and the deceptions.
If you come with me, you won't ever have to lie again.
Please.
Let me help you.
Never, dude.
Hey!
Hey, you got me!
That's right, you got me!
That's right!
I'm the killer!
Stop!
police!
Face your back towards me!
Slowly drop down to your knees!
I'm the murderer, I killed four people.
Three people.
However many are dead, I killed them.
I killed them.
I killed them all.
J-just- just get me away from here.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You have the right to speak to an attorney
Just get me out of here.
and to have one present during any questioning...
If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you.
I'm gonna make this quite simple for you.
You're gonna tell me what you're doing, how many of you there are and how you got here.
Let her go.
Unless you're answering my questions, don't speak.
I want you to tell me everything or I'll cut off her other hand.
What?
!
- "Other"?
- The first one isn't negotiable.
It's just to illustrate how serious I am.
No!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Chill out!
We're not supposed to be here.
Something's happening to the island.
- There are these flashes-
- Do it!
No!
Wait a second!
I'll tell you whatever you want to know!
- Do it!
- No!
James.
Juliet.
Nice to see you.
Any luck?
Yes.
Really?
Really.
What about you?
I'm having some... difficulties.
Well, you better get busy...
because you only have 70 hours.
What?
No, no.
That's not enough time.
I need at least-
What you need is irrelevant.
70 hours is what you've got.
Look, I lost Reyes tonight.
So what happens if I can't get them all to come back?
Then God help us all.

- [Hurley] Dude, they'll find out.
- [Jack] Not if we stick to the story.
[Sayid] I don't know, Jack.
It could be a risk.
[Jack] It's the only way.
We have to do this.
[Frank] They're still at it, huh?
[Jack] Look, we're running out of time.
We've gotta make a decision.
So are we all OK with this?
This is a decision that will affect the rest of our lives.
I'm not taking it lightly.
Kate?
Yeah.
[Jack] Sun?
- Frank?
- What?
Sorry you got dragged in.
We need to know you're with us.
Whatever you guys decide I'll just roll with.
[Jack] Hurley, what about you?
I don't think we should lie, dude.
We need to protect the people that we left behind, Hurley.
How does lying protect them?
It protects them from Charles Widmore.
The guy hired people to kill us.
He faked a plane crash.
Telling him the truth, he's gonna leave them alone?
Look, he's your dad, right?
Can't you, like, call him off?
There's no calling my father off.
He'll never find them.
The island disappeared.
We all saw it, it's gone.
Bloop!
You think anyone's gonna believe that?
Believe any of it?
They're gonna think you're crazy.
Not if someone backs me up.
Sayid, come on.
They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth, but what if we all do?
If we can stick together, we can make them believe us.
I don't want to spend my life lying.
Do you?
No.
But...
I don't believe we have a better choice.
I'm sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.
You know what, dude?
I'm gonna remember this.
And someday you're gonna need my help and I'm telling you right now you're not getting it.
Wake up, Sayid!
Sayid!
Sayid, wake up!
Sayid!
[tyres screeching]
[police siren wails]
No, no, no, no, no!
What do I do?
- What am I supposed to do?
!
- [police siren beeps]
OK, OK, OK.
Just stay calm.
What the hell were you thinking?
- Ana Lucia?
- You were driving like a maniac.
Now why'd you pull over?
I just...
- I thought...
- You didn't think.
What if I were real?
What if a real cop stopped you?
They have pictures of you covered in blood with a gun in your hand.
Actually, it's ketchup.
We went through a drive-through, and, uh...
Bro, you need to pull it together.
You've got a lot of work to do.
- I do?
- Let's start with the basics.
First off, you need new clothes.
Then you need to go to a safe place.
And take Sayid to somebody you trust.
- You getting all this?
- Yeah.
Then get to it.
And stay away from the cops.
Do not get arrested.
Thanks, Ana Lucia.
Oh, yeah.
Libby says hi.
- Well... you heard her.
- [engine revving]
[indistinct chattering]
You really think that thing's gonna work?
Of course it's gonna work.
It's better than rubbing two sticks together.
- That's what you're supposed to do.
- This will work better.
You've got too much wood inside, gonna smother the leaves.
If you don't have enough wood, the leaves burn out.
Fire?
Who cares about fire?
Any minute the sky could light up.
- Who knows what'll happen this time?
- Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control.
Help or be quiet.
- Whose shirt is this?
- Mine.
- Can I have it?
- What does it matter?
- We're all gonna be dead by sundown.
- I'll take that as a yes, Frogurt.
- It's Neil.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Still in one piece?
- As far as I can tell.
I figured it would disappear with our stuff.
I guess whatever we had with us when we moved is along for the ride.
- What?
- Look who's back.
- Welcome back, Dr Wizard.
- I think it's Mr Wizard.
Shut up.
You've been gone for two hours.
- What the hell were you doing?
- You're right.
Sorry.
I left my pack in the jungle, and I was coming back...
It was a while before I realised that I was really lost.
Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?
- I don't know.
- You got a plan?
We should take the Zodiac, head to a shipping lane.
No.
We can't just sail out on any course.
For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing.
And to do that I need to determine where we are now in time.
What are the rest of us supposed to do?
I'll go find something to eat.
- How are you planning on doing that?
- Don't worry about it.
I guess we'll get the water.
- [water splashing]
- Dude, wake up.
I can't do this on my own.
I promise I'll pay you back.
Wait right here.
[up-tempo rock music plays]
- Shih tzus?
- I like shih tzus.
It looks like you "heart" them.
- Rough night?
- Yeah.
- Your friend's pretty wasted.
- Yeah.
I know you from somewhere, don't I?
No.
I think I do.
Yeah, you definitely look familiar.
- I just have one of those faces?
- You're lying.
I don't believe in lying.
I remember!
You're the guy who won the lottery.
And you crashed in that plane.
No, I must look like him.
You're him.
Buy a ticket here.
You win, we get a commission.
- You're good luck.
- Sorry.
Wrong dude.
Keep the change.
OK.
- OK, we're out of here.
- [engine turning]
Mommy, I wanna go home.
Look at your book, baby.
[ringing]
Hello?
I can't believe it's you.
No.
Hi, how are you?
Wait.
You're in LA?
Of course I can meet.
Where...
I know exactly where that is.
I'll be there in a half an hour.
Mommy, where are we going?
To see a friend.
Looking for your pills, Jack?
I flushed them down the toilet.
Thank you.
I was just going to do that myself.
Yeah, I figured you were.
- Going somewhere?
- I'm checking out.
- Where are we going?
- You're going home and find yourself a suitcase.
If there's anything in this life you want, pack it in there because you're never coming back.
Good.
Good.
- I'll pick you up in six hours.
- And where will you be going?
John's casket is outside in a carpet van.
I need to move it somewhere safe.
Safe?
He's dead, isn't he?
I'll see you in six hours, Jack.
[grunts]
Mmm...
- [TV turns on] - [man] Previously on Exposé:
[woman] Looks like the Scorpion is taking over the Cobra's business.
[woman 2] You want me to work with Tsunami, the Dragon Lady of Van Nuys?
- Yeah.
- [woman] I'm here to capture the Scorpion, so if you got a problem with that, you can go work stage three.
- [pounding on door] - [man] She's hit!
- [screaming]
- Someone call an ambulance...
- [pounding on glass]
- Hmm.
Hey, Dad.
How's it going?
- Have you seen the news?
- No, I just got up.
- You on it again?
- Yeah.
Kind of.
- Is Mom here?
- No, she's out shopping.
Set him over here.
- Oh, man, he's out.
- Is he breathing?
Barely.
What happened?
- He got shot by a dart.
- A dart?
Where were you, the zoo?
- No, we were at the safe house.
- The safe house?
Sayid took me there.
To protect me.
These two guys jumped out and shot him with darts, and now he's in a coma.
This doesn't make sense.
What are you doing out of the institution?
Sayid pulled me out.
I'm in danger, we both are.
Danger from who?
I'm not sure, exactly.
[phone ringing]
- Hello?
- [man] Mr. Reyes?
LAPD.
Could you open the gate, please?
- What kind of trouble are you in?
- Don't tell them I'm here.
All right.
But you're gonna tell me the truth.
[indistinct chattering]
- You killed three people?
- No.
- Sayid did.
- Oh, well, that's better.
- Let's get him to the couch.
- He saved me.
- I think we should call a lawyer now.
- No, no, no.
We can't go public.
They're after us.
- Who?
Who is after you?
- I don't know.
- Sayid knows.
He can explain.
- Sayid ain't explaining nothing.
We need to get him to a hospital.
Did you hear me?
People are trying to kill us!
If we go there, they'll find us.
Like The Godfather.
It's the last place you go.
Everyone knows it.
They smother you with pillows and make it look like an accident.
Wake up!
That's not gonna work.
We need a doctor.
- I think I know what to do.
- [elevator bell rings]
- Mommy, can I push the button?
- Sure, you can, sweetie.
We're going all the way to the top, OK?
I want you to press number 31.
See it?
You see it?
OK, 31.
Yeah!
You pressed it.
You pressed it.
Hi.
Hello, Kate.
[woman] Have a nice day.
I'll be right with you.
Hello, Ben.
If it's the porterhouse you're looking for, we're out.
No, no porterhouse.
I do, however, have something important in my van, Jill.
- I need you to watch it for me.
- Is it what I think it is?
It is.
He'll be safe with me.
- Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in?
- Everything's moving on schedule.
- How's it going with Shephard?
- He's with us.
- Really?
Did you bribe him with pills?
- Cut the man some slack.
- He's been through a lot.
We all have.
- Right.
Of course.
Sorry.
So keep him safe, Jill.
Because if you don't everything we're about to do won't matter at all.
[excited chattering]
You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it!
- Why did you do that?
- You're supposed to fan it.
- You said you knew how to start a fire.
- You said you didn't care.
- I care about surviving.
- You need to take a timeout, Neil.
[scoffs]
You'll get it, Bernard.
You will.
Just... just try again.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Give me one second.
I got you something.
Ooh, hey!
- Found these in the jungle.
- Thank you.
There was only two.
I thought we could both do with a bite to eat.
Thank you very much.
You all right?
I just can't seem to shake this bloody headache.
- I'm sure it'll pass.
- It's not just that.
It was the weirdest thing, earlier I was...
I was thinking about my mom, and... all of a sudden I couldn't remember her maiden name.
- Isn't that odd?
- Don't worry about it.
All of us have been under a lot of stress.
OK?
Daniel do you know what's happening to me?
[Miles] Dinner!
That's great!
Where did you get that?
- I found it.
- What do you mean, you found it?
It died in the jungle.
I found it.
Don't worry, it's fine.
It's only been dead three hours.
- [Sawyer] What?
- Who's got a knife?
A knife?
You need a knife?
It's by the Cuisinart next to the stove.
- What's your problem?
- My problem is we don't have a knife.
We don't have anything.
It wouldn't matter if we did 'cause the dentist can't start a fire.
- Ease up there, Frogurt.
- It's Neil, you inbred!
And I'm not gonna ease up, 'cause I'm tired,
- hungry and screwed!
We're all screwed!
- Calm down.
- We're gonna get through this.
- How?
!
Didn't you hear what I just said!
?
We can't even get fire!
- [screaming] - [arrows whizzing]
Run!
[all screaming] [wailing]
[Sawyer] Come on.
Get up, get up!
- [screaming] - [barking]
[grunts]
Come on, split up!
Everybody get to the creek!
Dan!
- Keep moving!
- [screaming]
[grunts]
Come on, he's dead.
Come on, you wanna be dead too?
Come on!
There's nothing you could have done.
We got to go now!
- Dude, they're on a stakeout?
- You escaped from a mental institution.
There are dead bodies!
Of course they're on a stakeout.
They think you're crazy enough to come home.
So are you crazy?
Do you think I am?
Either that or you're lying to me.
Well, I'm not crazy.
And I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.
What is it?
Why is there a dead Pakistani on my couch?
- He's not dead, Ma.
- Well, he's not breathing.
He's not?
!
- It's OK, Carmen, we have a plan.
- A plan?
What are you talking about?
He is breathing.
Kind of.
Dad, we gotta go now!
- What is happening?
- Mom, please!
No "Mom, please" me!
Why are you all over the news?
Do you know what they are saying?
Yeah, I know.
Everything's gonna make sense, I promise.
It better!
Officers.
So how long are you in LA?
Just a few days.
I have some business to attend to.
But I wanted to see you.
Here it is.
Her name's Ji Yeon.
Here's a baby picture.
- Oh...
Aww...
She's beautiful.
- Thank you.
She's with her grandmother in Seoul.
I hope someday you get to meet her.
It would be nice to see her and Aaron play together.
Yeah.
Kate, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you?
- Somebody knows we're lying.
- What?
- Some lawyers came to see me.
- Who?
Two men.
They came to my house and they asked for a blood sample.
Some kind of lawsuit.
They wanted to test to see if...
To see if Aaron's my son.
Who do these lawyers represent?
I don't know.
They wouldn't tell me who their client is.
Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.
- How do you know?
- If they were, they would just do it.
They wouldn't come to you in private.
They don't care we're lying.
They want Aaron.
But who would do that?
I don't know, but you need to take care of them.
What do you mean, "take care of them"?
Wouldn't you do anything you had to in order to keep Aaron?
What kind of a person do you think I am?
[screaming in Korean]
[Sun screaming] Jin!
The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.
Get the baby on the chopper, I'll get Jin.
Like you did on the freighter.
You told me to get on the helicopter, and you said you'd get Jin.
- Sun, I hope you don't think...
- You did what you had to do.
And if you hadn't we probably all would have died, instead of just my husband.
I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry.
I don't blame you.
So... how's Jack?
Hugo said I could trust you.
I wasn't so sure.
But he swore I could.
So... can I?
- Yes.
Of course.
- All right.
- What happened to him?
- Hugo said he got hit with some dart.
- Must've been some drugs.
- And where is Hurley?
At our house, freaking out.
[Jack] I'm gonna get my car, help me move him over.
- I have to get him to the hospital.
- No.
Hugo said whoever did this will come back.
All due respect, Mr. Reyes, you brought him to me.
I'm gonna do what's best.
Fine.
Take him to the hospital.
All due respect, Dr Shephard, when this is over,
- you're gonna do something for me.
- What?
Stay away from Hugo.
Whatever you talked him into, you don't have his best interests at heart.
So stay away from my son.
[ambulance siren wails]
[Ben] Hello.
Ben... you'll never guess who just showed up at my door.
- Who?
- Sayid.
Who is Sayid?
I thought he was your friend.
He is my friend.
But he's also got this double life where he does crazy ninja moves and spy stuff.
- But he's a good guy.
- A good guy doesn't kill three men.
- A good guy doesn't kill any men.
- Mom...
Don't "Mom" me.
You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.
The news thinks you did this.
And if the news does, everyone does.
Why is this happening?
How can anybody want to hurt you?
I don't know.
Tell your mother the truth.
We lied, Ma.
- What do you mean, you lied?
- All of us.
The Oceanic Six.
We lied about what happened after the crash.
And what did happen?
OK.
See, we did crash.
But it was on this crazy island.
And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue.
There was a smoke monster and other people on the island.
We called them "the Others."
They started attacking us.
And we found hatches.
There was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or...
Well, I was never really clear on that.
The Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches.
That was the Dharma Initiative.
But the Others killed them.
Now they're trying to kill us.
And then we teamed up with the Others because worse people were coming.
Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us.
We stole their helicopter, flew to their freighter, but it blew up.
We couldn't go to the island.
It disappeared.
So we crashed in the ocean, and floated a while until a boat picked us up.
By then there were six of us.
That part was true.
But the re...
But the rest of the people who were on the plane...
They're still on that island.
I believe you.
I don't understand you, but I believe you.
A lot of people died, Ma.
Now this bad stuff is happening because...
Well...
We shouldn't have lied.
- [branch snapping]
- Ow!
You OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just stepped on something.
Something jammed...
Son of a bitch.
Keep moving, we gotta hook up with everybody at the creek.
It's a long creek, James.
Which part?
The wet part.
Sorry if my plan's not up to Other... [footsteps approaching]
Who were those people?
Were they yours?
- Did they shoot the arrows?
- Want me to crawl out and ask?
You don't have to be a wise-ass.
I'm just trying to... [gasping]
What are you doing on our island?
[woman on PA] Respiratory therapist to ICU.
Respiratory therapist... [machine beeping]
[Jack] Come on.
Son of a bitch.
Come on, Sayid.
Come on.
[gasping] Sayid!
Sayid!
It's me.
It's Jack.
[both panting]
It's OK.
It's all right.
You're OK.
You're all right.
What happened?
You're fine.
You're in the hospital.
Hurley's father brought you to me.
Hurley's father?
He said you'd been attacked.
- Where's Hurley?
- He's at his parents' house.
- Who's with him?
- I don't know.
His mother, maybe?
Does anyone else know he's there?
- [sizzling] - [bell rings]
Ah!
- Hello, Hugo.
- [screams]
Get away from me!
Get away!
Hugo, I know you're in trouble.
And I can assure you, I've taken care of everything.
I have a car waiting for us out back.
The police didn't see me.
I can get you out of here.
No way, dude.
Sayid warned me about you.
I'm taking you to Sayid.
He's with Jack.
That's why I'm here.
Jack called me.
How else would I know that they're together?
No!
You're playing one of your mind games.
They would never trust you.
In their defence, I'm not an easy person to trust.
But they came around when they realised that we all want the same thing.
And what's that?
To go back to the island.
Come with us, Hugo.
And this will be over.
You can stop hiding.
You can stop worrying about the stories and deceptions.
If you come with me you won't ever have to lie again.
Please...
Let me help you.
Never, dude.
Hey.
Hey!
You got me!
That's right, you got me!
- That's right, I'm the killer!
- Stop!
Police!
[Hurley] I'm crazy!
I'm a murderer!
I killed four people!
Three people...
However many are dead, I killed them!
I killed them all.
Just get me away from here!
[man] Have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an attorney...
Just get me out of here.
[man] If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you.
[grunting]
I'm gonna make this simple.
Tell me what you're doing, how many of you there are and how you got here.
- Let her go.
- Unless you're answering questions, don't speak.
Tell me, or I cut off her other hand.
- What?
- Other?
The first one isn't negotiable, it's just to illustrate how serious I am.
Hold on.
Chill out!
We're not supposed to be here.
- The island, there are these flashes...
- Do it.
I'll tell you what you want to know!
- Do it!
- No!
- [gunshot] - [grunts]
[groans]
James.
Juliet.
Nice to see you.
[beeping]
- Any luck?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Really.
- What about you?
- I'm having some difficulties.
Well, you'd better get busy 'cause you only have 70 hours.
That's not enough!
I need at least...
What you need is irrelevant.
Seventy hours is what you've got.
Look, I lost Reyes tonight.
What happens if I can't get them all to come back?
Then God help us all.
- Dude, they'll find out.
- Not if we stick to the story.
I don't know, Jack.
It could be a risk.
It's the only way.
We have to do this.
They're still at it, huh?
Look, we're running out of time.
We've gotta make a decision now.
So are we all OK with this?
This is a decision that will affect the rest of our lives.
I'm not taking it lightly.
Kate?
Yeah.
Sun?
- Frank?
- What?
Sorry you got dragged in.
We need to know you're with us.
Whatever you guys decide I'll just roll with.
Hurley, what about you?
I don't think we should lie, dude.
We need to protect the people that we left behind, Hurley.
How does lying protect them?
It protects them from Charles Widmore.
The guy hired people to kill us.
He faked a plane crash.
Telling him the truth, he's gonna leave them alone?
Look, he's your dad, right?
Can't you, like, call him off?
There's no calling my father off.
He'll never find them.
The island disappeared.
We all saw it, it's gone.
You think anyone's gonna believe that?
Believe any of it?
They're gonna think you're crazy.
Not if someone backs me up.
Sayid, come on.
They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth, but what if we all do?
If we can stick together, we can make them believe us.
I don't want to spend my life lying.
Do you?
No.
But...
I don't believe we have a better choice.
I'm sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.
You know what, dude?
I'm gonna remember this.
And someday you're gonna need my help and I'm telling you right now you're not getting it.
Wake up, Sayid!
Sayid!
Sayid, wake up!
Sayid!
No, no, no, no, no!
What do I do?
What am I supposed to do?
!
OK, OK, OK.
Just stay calm.
What the hell were you thinking?
- Ana Lucia?
- You were driving like a maniac.
Now why'd you pull over?
I just...
- I thought...
- You didn't think.
What if I were real?
What if a real cop stopped you?
They have pictures of you covered in blood with a gun in your hand.
Actually, it's ketchup.
We went through a drive-through, and...
Bro, you need to pull it together.
You've got a lot of work to do.
- I do?
- Let's start with the basics.
First off, you need new clothes.
Then you need to go to a safe place.
And take Sayid to somebody you trust.
- You getting all this?
- Yeah.
Then get to it.
And stay away from the cops.
Do not get arrested.
Thanks, Ana Lucia.
Oh, yeah.
Libby says hi.
Well... you heard her.
You really think that thing's gonna work?
Of course it's gonna work.
It's better than rubbing two sticks together.
- That's what you're supposed to do.
- This will work better.
You've got too much wood inside, gonna smother the leaves.
If you don't have enough wood, the leaves burn out.
Fire?
Who cares about fire?
Any minute the sky could light up.
- Who knows what'll happen this time?
- Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control.
Help or be quiet.
- Whose shirt is this?
- Mine.
- Can I have it?
- What does it matter?
- We're all gonna be dead by sundown.
- I'll take that as a yes, Frogurt.
- It's Neil.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Still in one piece?
- As far as I can tell.
I figured it would disappear with our stuff.
I guess whatever we had with us when we moved is along for the ride.
- What?
- Look who's back.
- Welcome back, Dr. Wizard.
- I think it's Mr. Wizard.
Shut up.
You've been gone for two hours.
- What the hell were you doing?
- You're right.
Sorry.
I left my pack in the jungle, and I was coming back...
It was a while before I realized that I was really lost.
Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?
- I don't know.
- You got a plan?
We should take the Zodiac, head to a shipping lane.
No.
We can't just sail out on any course.
For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing.
And to do that I need to determine where we are now in time.
What are the rest of us supposed to do?
I'll go find something to eat.
- How are you planning on doing that?
- Don't worry about it.
I guess we'll get the water.
Dude, wake up.
I can't do this on my own.
I promise I'll pay you back.
Wait right here.
- Shih tzus?
- I like shih tzus.
It looks like you "heart" them.
- Rough night?
- Yeah.
- Your friend's pretty wasted.
- Yeah.
I know you from somewhere, don't I?
No.
I think I do.
Yeah, you definitely look familiar.
- I just have one of those faces?
- You're lying.
I don't believe in lying.
I remember!
You're the guy who won the lottery.
And you crashed in that plane.
No, I must look like him.
You're him.
Buy a ticket here.
You win, we get a commission.
- You're good luck.
- Sorry.
Wrong dude.
Keep the change.
OK.
OK, we're out of here.
Mommy, I wanna go home.
Look at your book, baby.
Hello?
I can't believe it's you.
No.
Hi, how are you?
Wait.
You're in LA?
Of course I can meet.
Where...
I know exactly where that is.
I'll be there in a half an hour.
Mommy, where are we going?
To see a friend.
Looking for your pills, Jack?
I flushed them down the toilet.
Thank you.
I was just going to do that myself.
Yeah, I figured you were.
- Going somewhere?
- I'm checking out.
Where are we going?
You're going home and find yourself a suitcase.
If there's anything in this life you want, pack it in there because you're never coming back.
Good.
- I'll pick you up in six hours.
- And where will you be going?
John's casket is outside in a carpet van.
I need to move it somewhere safe.
Safe?
He's dead, isn't he?
I'll see you in six hours, Jack.
Previously on Expose:
Looks like the Scorpion is taking over all the Cobra's business.
You want me to work with Tsunami, the Dragon Lady of Van Nuys?
- Yeah.
- I'm here to capture the Scorpion, so if you got a problem with that, you can go work stage three.
She's hit!
Someone call an ambulance...
Hey, Dad.
How's it going?
- Have you seen the news?
- No, I just got up.
- You on it again?
- Yeah.
Kind of.
- Is Mom here?
- No, she's out shopping.
Set him over here.
- Oh, man, he's out.
- Is he breathing?
Barely.
What happened?
- He got shot by a dart.
- A dart?
Where were you, the zoo?
- No, we were at the safe house.
- The safe house?
Sayid took me there.
To protect me.
These two guys jumped out and shot him with darts, and now he's in a coma.
This doesn't make sense.
What are you doing out of the institution?
Sayid pulled me out.
I'm in danger, we both are.
Danger from who?
I'm not sure, exactly.
- Hello?
- Mr. Reyes?
LAPD.
Could you open the gate, please?
- What kind of trouble are you in?
- Don't tell them I'm here.
All right.
But you're gonna tell me the truth.
- You killed three people?
- No.
- Sayid did.
- Oh, well, that's better.
- Let's get him to the couch.
- He saved me.
- I think we should call a lawyer now.
- No, no, no.
We can't go public.
They're after us.
- Who?
Who is after you?
- I don't know.
- Sayid knows.
He can explain.
- Sayid ain't explaining nothing.
We need to get him to a hospital.
Did you hear me?
People are trying to kill us!
If we go there, they'll find us.
Like The Godfather.
It's the last place you go.
Everyone knows it.
They smother you with pillows and make it look like an accident.
Wake up!
That's not gonna work.
We need a doctor.
I think I know what to do.
- Mommy, can I push the button?
- Sure, you can, sweetie.
We're going all the way to the top, OK?
I want you to press number 31.
See it?
You see it?
OK, 31.
Yeah!
You pressed it.
You pressed it.
Hi.
Hello, Kate.
Have a nice day.
I'll be right with you.
Hello, Ben.
If it's the porterhouse you're looking for, we're out.
No, no porterhouse.
I do, however, have something important in my van, Jill.
- I need you to watch it for me.
- Is it what I think it is?
It is.
He'll be safe with me.
- Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in?
- Everything's moving on schedule.
- How's it going with Shephard?
- He's with us.
- Really?
Did you bribe him with pills?
- Cut the man some slack.
- He's been through a lot.
We all have.
- Right.
Of course.
Sorry.
So keep him safe, Jill.
Because if you don't everything we're about to do won't matter at all.
You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it!
- Why did you do that?
- You're supposed to fan it.
- You said you knew how to start a fire.
- You said you didn't care.
- I care about surviving.
- You need to take a timeout, Neil.
You'll get it, Bernard.
You will.
Just... just try again.
Hey.
Hi.
Give me one second.
I got you something.
- Found these in the jungle.
- Thank you.
There was only two.
I thought we could both do with a bite to eat.
Thank you very much.
You all right?
I just can't seem to shake this bloody headache.
- I'm sure it'll pass.
- It's not just that.
It was the weirdest thing, earlier I was...
I was thinking about my mom, and... all of a sudden I couldn't remember her maiden name.
- Isn't that odd?
- Don't worry about it.
All of us have been under a lot of stress.
OK?
Daniel do you know what's happening to me?
Dinner!
That's great!
Where did you get that?
I found it.
What do you mean, you found it?
It died in the jungle.
I found it.
Don't worry, it's fine.
It's only been dead three hours.
- What?
- Who's got a knife?
A knife?
You need a knife?
It's by the Cuisinart next to the stove.
- What's your problem?
- My problem is we don't have a knife.
We don't have anything.
It wouldn't matter if we did 'cause the dentist can't start a fire.
- Ease up there, Frogurt.
- It's Neil, you inbred!
And I'm not gonna ease up, 'cause I'm tired,
- hungry and screwed!
We're all screwed!
- Calm down.
- We're gonna get through this.
- How?
!
Didn't you hear what I just said!
?
We can't even get fire!
Run!
Come on.
Get up, get up!
Come on, split up!
Everybody get to the creek!
Dan!
Keep moving!
Come on, he's dead.
Come on, you wanna be dead too?
Come on!
There's nothing you could have done.
We got to go now!
- Dude, they're on a stakeout?
- You escaped from a mental institution.
There are dead bodies!
Of course they're on a stakeout.
They think you're crazy enough to come home.
So are you crazy?
Do you think I am?
Either that or you're lying to me.
Well, I'm not crazy.
And I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.
What is it?
Why is there a dead Pakistani on my couch?
He's not dead, Ma.
Well, he's not breathing.
He's not?
!
- It's OK, Carmen, we have a plan.
- A plan?
What are you talking about?
He is breathing.
Kind of.
Dad, we gotta go now!
- What is happening?
- Mom, please!
No "Mom, please" me!
Why are you all over the news?
Do you know what they are saying?
Yeah, I know.
Everything's gonna make sense, I promise.
It better!
Officers.
So how long are you in LA?
Just a few days.
I have some business to attend to.
But I wanted to see you.
Here it is.
Her name's Ji Yeon.
Here's a baby picture.
- She's beautiful.
- Thank you.
She's with her grandmother in Seoul.
I hope someday you get to meet her.
It would be nice to see her and Aaron play together.
Yeah.
Kate, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you?
- Somebody knows we're lying.
- What?
- Some lawyers came to see me.
- Who?
Two men.
They came to my house and they asked for a blood sample.
Some kind of lawsuit.
They wanted to test to see if...
To see if Aaron's my son.
Who do these lawyers represent?
I don't know.
They wouldn't tell me who their client is.
Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.
- How do you know?
- If they were, they would just do it.
They wouldn't come to you in private.
They don't care we're lying.
They want Aaron.
But who would do that?
I don't know, but you need to take care of them.
What do you mean, "take care of them"?
Wouldn't you do anything you had to in order to keep Aaron?
What kind of a person do you think I am?
The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.
Like you did on the freighter.
You told me to get on the helicopter, and you said you'd get Jin.
Sun, I hope you don't think...
You did what you had to do.
And if you hadn't we probably all would have died, instead of just my husband.
I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry.
I don't blame you.
So... how's Jack?
Hugo said I could trust you.
I wasn't so sure.
But he swore I could.
So... can I?
- Yes.
Of course.
- All right.
- What happened to him?
- Hugo said he got hit with some dart.
- Must've been some drugs.
- And where is Hurley?
At our house, freaking out.
I'm gonna get my car, help me move him over.
- I have to get him to the hospital.
- No.
Hugo said whoever did this will come back.
All due respect, Mr. Reyes, you brought him to me.
I'm gonna do what's best.
Fine.
Take him to the hospital.
All due respect, Dr. Shephard, when this is over,
- you're gonna do something for me.
- What?
Stay away from Hugo.
Whatever you talked him into, you don't have his best interests at heart.
So stay away from my son.
Hello.
Ben... you'll never guess who just showed up at my door.
- Who?
- Sayid.
Who is Sayid?
I thought he was your friend.
He is my friend.
But he's also got this double life where he does crazy ninja moves and spy stuff.
- But he's a good guy.
- A good guy doesn't kill three men.
- A good guy doesn't kill any men.
- Mom...
Don't "Mom" me.
You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.
The news thinks you did this.
And if the news does, everyone does.
Why is this happening?
How can anybody want to hurt you?
I don't know.
Tell your mother the truth.
We lied, Ma.
- What do you mean, you lied?
- All of us.
The Oceanic Six.
We lied about what happened after the crash.
And what did happen?
OK.
See, we did crash.
But it was on this crazy island.
And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue.
There was a smoke monster and other people on the island.

- Did they shoot the arrows?

You don't have to be a wise-ass.
I'm just trying to...
What are you doing on our island?
Respiratory therapist to ICU.
Respiratory therapist...
Transport to Radiology.
Transport to Radiology.
Come on.
Son of a bitch.
Come on, Sayid.
Come on.
Sayid!
Sayid!
It's me.
It's Jack.
It's OK.
It's all right.
You're OK.
You're all right.
What happened?
You're fine.
You're in the hospital.
Hurley's father brought you to me.
Hurley's father?
He said you'd been attacked.
- Where's Hurley?
- He's at his parents' house.
- Who's with him?
- I don't know.
His mother, maybe?
Does anyone else know he's there?
Hello, Hugo.
Get away from me!
Get away!
Hugo, I know you're in trouble.
And I can assure you, I've taken care of everything.

I'm crazy!
I'm a murderer!
I killed four people!
Three people...

I killed them all.

We all saw it, it's gone.
You think anyone's gonna believe that?
Believe any of it?
They're gonna think you're crazy.
Not if someone backs me up.
Sayid, come on.
They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth, but what if we all do?
If we can stick together, we can make them believe us.
I don't want to spend my life lying.
Do you?
No.
But...
I don't believe we have a better choice.
I'm sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.
You know what, dude?
I'm gonna remember this.
And someday you're gonna need my help and I'm telling you right now you're not getting it.
Wake up, Sayid!
Sayid!
Sayid, wake up!
Sayid!
No, no, no, no, no!
What do I do?
What am I supposed to do?
!
OK, OK, OK.
Just stay calm.
What the hell were you thinking?
- Ana Lucia?
- You were driving like a maniac.
Now why'd you pull over?
I just...
- I thought...
- You didn't think.
What if I were real?
What if a real cop stopped you?
They have pictures of you covered in blood with a gun in your hand.
Actually, it's ketchup.
We went through a drive-through, and...
Bro, you need to pull it together.
You've got a lot of work to do.
- I do?
- Let's start with the basics.
First off, you need new clothes.
Then you need to go to a safe place.
And take Sayid to somebody you trust.
- You getting all this?
- Yeah.
Then get to it.
And stay away from the cops.
Do not get arrested.
Thanks, Ana Lucia.
Oh, yeah.
Libby says hi.
Well... you heard her.
You really think that thing's gonna work?
Of course it's gonna work.
It's better than rubbing two sticks together.
- That's what you're supposed to do.
- This will work better.
You've got too much wood inside, gonna smother the leaves.
If you don't have enough wood, the leaves burn out.
Fire?
Who cares about fire?
Any minute the sky could light up.
- Who knows what'll happen this time?
- Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control.
Help or be quiet.
- Whose shirt is this?
- Mine.
- Can I have it?
- What does it matter?
- We're all gonna be dead by sundown.
- I'll take that as a yes, Frogurt.
- It's Neil.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Still in one piece?
- As far as I can tell.
I figured it would disappear with our stuff.
I guess whatever we had with us when we moved is along for the ride.
- What?
- Look who's back.
- Welcome back, Dr. Wizard.
- I think it's Mr. Wizard.
Shut up.
You've been gone for two hours.
- What the hell were you doing?
- You're right.
Sorry.
I left my pack in the jungle, and I was coming back...
It was a while before I realized that I was really lost.
Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?
- I don't know.
- You got a plan?
We should take the Zodiac, head to a shipping lane.
No.
We can't just sail out on any course.
For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing.
And to do that I need to determine where we are now in time.
What are the rest of us supposed to do?
I'll go find something to eat.
- How are you planning on doing that?
- Don't worry about it.
I guess we'll get the water.
Dude, wake up.
I can't do this on my own.
I promise I'll pay you back.
Wait right here.
- Shih tzus?
- I like shih tzus.
It looks like you "heart" them.
- Rough night?
- Yeah.
- Your friend's pretty wasted.
- Yeah.
I know you from somewhere, don't I?
No.
I think I do.
Yeah, you definitely look familiar.
- I just have one of those faces?
- You're lying.
I don't believe in lying.
I remember!
You're the guy who won the lottery.
And you crashed in that plane.
No, I must look like him.
You're him.
Buy a ticket here.
You win, we get a commission.
- You're good luck.
- Sorry.
Wrong dude.
Keep the change.
OK.
OK, we're out of here.
Mommy, I wanna go home.
Look at your book, baby.
Hello?
I can't believe it's you.
No.
Hi, how are you?
Wait.
You're in LA?
Of course I can meet.
Where...
I know exactly where that is.
I'll be there in a half an hour.
Mommy, where are we going?
To see a friend.
Looking for your pills, Jack?
I flushed them down the toilet.
Thank you.
I was just going to do that myself.
Yeah, I figured you were.
- Going somewhere?
- I'm checking out.
Where are we going?
You're going home and find yourself a suitcase.
If there's anything in this life you want, pack it in there because you're never coming back.
Good.
Good.
- I'll pick you up in six hours.
- And where will you be going?
John's casket is outside in a carpet van.
I need to move it somewhere safe.
Safe?
He's dead, isn't he?
I'll see you in six hours, Jack.
Previously on Exposé:
Looks like the Scorpion is taking over all the Cobra's business.
You want me to work with Tsunami, the Dragon Lady of Van Nuys?
- Yeah.
- I'm here to capture the Scorpion, so if you got a problem with that, you can go work stage three.
She's hit!
Someone call an ambulance...
Hey, Dad.
How's it going?
- Have you seen the news?
- No, I just got up.
- You on it again?
- Yeah.
Kind of.
- Is Mom here?
- No, she's out shopping.
Set him over here.
- Oh, man, he's out.
- Is he breathing?
Barely.
What happened?
- He got shot by a dart.
- A dart?
Where were you, the zoo?
- No, we were at the safe house.
- The safe house?
Sayid took me there.
To protect me.
These two guys jumped out and shot him with darts, and now he's in a coma.
This doesn't make sense.
What are you doing out of the institution?
Sayid pulled me out.
I'm in danger, we both are.
Danger from who?
I'm not sure, exactly.
- Hello?
- Mr. Reyes?
LAPD.
Could you open the gate, please?
- What kind of trouble are you in?
- Don't tell them I'm here.
All right.
But you're gonna tell me the truth.
- You killed three people?
- No.
- Sayid did.
- Oh, well, that's better.
- Let's get him to the couch.
- He saved me.
- I think we should call a lawyer now.
- No, no, no.
We can't go public.
They're after us.
- Who?
Who is after you?
- I don't know.
- Sayid knows.
He can explain.
- Sayid ain't explaining nothing.
We need to get him to a hospital.
Did you hear me?
People are trying to kill us!
If we go there, they'll find us.
Like The Godfather.
It's the last place you go.
Everyone knows it.
They smother you with pillows and make it look like an accident.
Wake up!
That's not gonna work.
We need a doctor.
I think I know what to do.
- Mommy, can I push the button?
- Sure, you can, sweetie.
We're going all the way to the top, OK?
I want you to press number 31.
See it?
You see it?
OK, 31.
Yeah!
You pressed it.
You pressed it.
Hi.
Hello, Kate.
Have a nice day.
I'll be right with you.
Hello, Ben.
If it's the porterhouse you're looking for, we're out.
No, no porterhouse.
I do, however, have something important in my van, Jill.
- I need you to watch it for me.
- Is it what I think it is?
It is.
He'll be safe with me.
- Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in?
- Everything's moving on schedule.
- How's it going with Shephard?
- He's with us.
- Really?
Did you bribe him with pills?
- Cut the man some slack.
- He's been through a lot.
We all have.
- Right.
Of course.
Sorry.
So keep him safe, Jill.
Because if you don't everything we're about to do won't matter at all.
You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it!
- Why did you do that?
- You're supposed to fan it.
- You said you knew how to start a fire.
- You said you didn't care.
- I care about surviving.
- You need to take a timeout, Neil.
You'll get it, Bernard.
You will.
Just... just try again.
Hey.
Hi.
Give me one second.
I got you something.
- Found these in the jungle.
- Thank you.
There was only two.
I thought we could both do with a bite to eat.
Thank you very much.
You all right?
I just can't seem to shake this bloody headache.
- I'm sure it'll pass.
- It's not just that.
It was the weirdest thing, earlier I was...
I was thinking about my mom, and... all of a sudden I couldn't remember her maiden name.
- Isn't that odd?
- Don't worry about it.
All of us have been under a lot of stress.
OK?
Daniel do you know what's happening to me?
Dinner!
That's great!
Where did you get that?
I found it.
What do you mean, you found it?
It died in the jungle.
I found it.
Don't worry, it's fine.
It's only been dead three hours.
- What?
- Who's got a knife?
A knife?
You need a knife?
It's by the Cuisinart next to the stove.
- What's your problem?
- My problem is we don't have a knife.
We don't have anything.
It wouldn't matter if we did 'cause the dentist can't start a fire.
- Ease up there, Frogurt.
- It's Neil, you inbred!
And I'm not gonna ease up, 'cause I'm tired,
- hungry and screwed!
We're all screwed!
- Calm down.
- We're gonna get through this.
- How?
!
Didn't you hear what I just said!
?
We can't even get fire!
Run!
Come on.
Get up, get up!
Come on, split up!
Everybody get to the creek!
Dan!
Keep moving!
Come on, he's dead.
Come on, you wanna be dead too?
Come on!
There's nothing you could have done.
We got to go now!
- Dude, they're on a stakeout?
- You escaped from a mental institution.
There are dead bodies!
Of course they're on a stakeout.
They think you're crazy enough to come home.
So are you crazy?
Do you think I am?
Either that or you're lying to me.
Well, I'm not crazy.
And I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.
What is it?
Why is there a dead Pakistani on my couch?
He's not dead, Ma.
Well, he's not breathing.
He's not?
!
- It's OK, Carmen, we have a plan.
- A plan?
What are you talking about?
He is breathing.
Kind of.
Dad, we gotta go now!
- What is happening?
- Mom, please!
No "Mom, please" me!
Why are you all over the news?
Do you know what they are saying?
Yeah, I know.
Everything's gonna make sense, I promise.
It better!
Officers.
So how long are you in LA?
Just a few days.
I have some business to attend to.
But I wanted to see you.
Here it is.
Her name's Ji Yeon.
Here's a baby picture.
- She's beautiful.
- Thank you.
She's with her grandmother in Seoul.
I hope someday you get to meet her.
It would be nice to see her and Aaron play together.
Yeah.
Kate, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you?
- Somebody knows we're lying.
- What?
- Some lawyers came to see me.
- Who?
Two men.
They came to my house and they asked for a blood sample.
Some kind of lawsuit.
They wanted to test to see if...
To see if Aaron's my son.
Who do these lawyers represent?
I don't know.
They wouldn't tell me who their client is.
Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.
- How do you know?
- If they were, they would just do it.
They wouldn't come to you in private.
They don't care we're lying.
They want Aaron.
But who would do that?
I don't know, but you need to take care of them.
What do you mean, "take care of them"?
Wouldn't you do anything you had to in order to keep Aaron?
What kind of a person do you think I am?
The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.
Like you did on the freighter.
You told me to get on the helicopter, and you said you'd get Jin.
Sun, I hope you don't think...
You did what you had to do.
And if you hadn't we probably all would have died, instead of just my husband.
I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry.
I don't blame you.
So... how's Jack?
Hugo said I could trust you.
I wasn't so sure.
But he swore I could.
So... can I?
- Yes.
Of course.
- All right.
- What happened to him?
- Hugo said he got hit with some dart.
- Must've been some drugs.
- And where is Hurley?
At our house, freaking out.
I'm gonna get my car, help me move him over.
- I have to get him to the hospital.
- No.
Hugo said whoever did this will come back.
All due respect, Mr. Reyes, you brought him to me.
I'm gonna do what's best.
Fine.
Take him to the hospital.
All due respect, Dr. Shephard, when this is over,
- you're gonna do something for me.
- What?
Stay away from Hugo.
Whatever you talked him into, you don't have his best interests at heart.
So stay away from my son.
Hello.
Ben... you'll never guess who just showed up at my door.
- Who?
- Sayid.
Who is Sayid?
I thought he was your friend.
He is my friend.
But he's also got this double life where he does crazy ninja moves and spy stuff.
- But he's a good guy.
- A good guy doesn't kill three men.
- A good guy doesn't kill any men.
- Mom...
Don't "Mom" me.
You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.
The news thinks you did this.
And if the news does, everyone does.
Why is this happening?
How can anybody want to hurt you?
I don't know.
Tell your mother the truth.
We lied, Ma.
- What do you mean, you lied?
- All of us.
The Oceanic Six.
We lied about what happened after the crash.
And what did happen?
OK.
See, we did crash.
But it was on this crazy island.
And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue.
There was a smoke monster and other people on the island.
We called them "the Others."
They started attacking us.
And we found hatches.
There was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or...
Well, I was never really clear on that.
The Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches.
That was the Dharma Initiative.
But the Others killed them.
Now they're trying to kill us.
And then we teamed up with the Others because worse people were coming.
Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us.
We stole their helicopter, flew to their freighter, but it blew up.
We couldn't go to the island.
It disappeared.
So we crashed in the ocean, and floated a while until a boat picked us up.
By then there were six of us.
That part was true.
But the re...
But the rest of the people who were on the plane...
They're still on that island.
I believe you.
I don't understand you, but I believe you.
A lot of people died, Ma.
Now this bad stuff is happening because...
Well...
We shouldn't have lied.
You OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just stepped on something.
Something jammed...
Son of a bitch.
Keep moving, we gotta hook up with everybody at the creek.
It's a long creek, James.
Which part?
The wet part.
Sorry if my plan's not up to Other...
Who were those people?
Were they yours?
- Did they shoot the arrows?
- Want me to crawl out and ask?
You don't have to be a wise-ass.
I'm just trying to...
What are you doing on our island?
Respiratory therapist to ICU.
Respiratory therapist...
Transport to Radiology.
Transport to Radiology.
Come on.
Son of a bitch.
Come on, Sayid.
Come on.
Sayid!
Sayid!
It's me.
It's Jack.
It's OK.
It's all right.
You're OK.
You're all right.
What happened?
You're fine.
You're in the hospital.
Hurley's father brought you to me.
Hurley's father?
He said you'd been attacked.
- Where's Hurley?
- He's at his parents' house.
- Who's with him?
- I don't know.
His mother, maybe?
Does anyone else know he's there?
Hello, Hugo.
Get away from me!
Get away!
Hugo, I know you're in trouble.
And I can assure you, I've taken care of everything.
I have a car waiting for us out back.
The police didn't see me.
I can get you out of here.
No way, dude.
Sayid warned me about you.
I'm taking you to Sayid.
He's with Jack.
That's why I'm here.
Jack called me.
How else would I know that they're together?
No!
You're playing one of your mind games.
They would never trust you.
In their defense, I'm not an easy person to trust.
But they came around when they realized that we all want the same thing.
And what's that?
To go back to the island.
Come with us, Hugo.
And this will be over.
You can stop hiding.
You can stop worrying about the stories and deceptions.
If you come with me you won't ever have to lie again.
Please...
Let me help you.
Never, dude.
You got me!
That's right, you got me!
- That's right, I'm the killer!
- Stop!
Police!
I'm crazy!
I'm a murderer!
I killed four people!
Three people...
However many are dead, I killed them!
I killed them all.
Just get me away from here!
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an attorney...
Just get me out of here.
If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you.
I'm gonna make this simple.
Tell me what you're doing, how many of you there are and how you got here.
- Let her go.
- Unless you're answering questions, don't speak.
Tell me, or I cut off her other hand.
- What?
- Other?
The first one isn't negotiable, it's just to illustrate how serious I am.
Hold on.
Chill out!
We're not supposed to be here.
- The island, there are these flashes...
- Do it.
I'll tell you what you want to know!
- Do it!
- No!
James.
Juliet.
Nice to see you.
- Any luck?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Really.
- What about you?
- I'm having some difficulties.
Well, you'd better get busy 'cause you only have 70 hours.
That's not enough!
I need at least...
What you need is irrelevant.
Seventy hours is what you've got.
Look, I lost Reyes tonight.
What happens if I can't get them all to come back?
Then God help us all.
Dude, they'll find out.
Not if we stick to the story.
I don't know, Jack.
It could be a risk.
It's the only way.
We have to do this.
They're still at it, huh?
Look, we're running out of time.
We gotta make a decision now.
So are we all okay with this?
This is a decision that will affect the rest of our lives.
I'm not taking it lightly.
Kate?
Yeah.
Sun?
- Frank?
- What?
Sorry you got dragged into this, but we need to know that you're with us.
Whatever you guys decide, I'll just roll with.
Hurley, what about you?
I don't think we should lie, dude.
We need to protect the people that we left behind, Hurley.
How does lying protect them?
It protects them from Charles Widmore.
The guy hired a boatload of people to kill all of us.
He faked a plane crash.
I mean, do you think telling him the truth, he's just gonna- he's gonna leave them alone?
Look, he's your dad, right?
Can't you, like... call him off?
There's no calling my father off.
But he'll never find them.
I mean, the island disappeared.
We all saw it.
It's gone.
Bloop!
You think anyone's gonna believe that...
Believe any of it?
They're gonna think you're crazy.
Not if someone backs me up.
Sayid, come on.
They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth.
But what if we all do?
And if we can stick together, we can make them believe us.
I don't want to spend the rest of my life lying.
Do you?
No.
But...
I don't believe we have a better choice.
I'm sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.
You know what, dude?
I'm gonna remember this.
And someday, you're gonna need my help, and I'm telling you right now...
You're not gettin' it.
Wake up, Sayid!
Sayid!
Sayid, wake up!
Sayid!
No, no, no, no, no!
What do I do?
!
What am I supposed to do?
!
Okay, okay, okay.
Just stay calm.
What the hell were you thinking?
- Ana Lucia?
- You were driving like a maniac.
And why'd you pull over?
I just...
I-I thought--
You didn't think.
What if I were real?
What if a real cop stopped you?
They already have pictures of you covered in blood,
- with a gun in your hand.
- Actually, it's ketchup.
We went to a-a drive-thru, and, uh....
Well, you need to pull it together.
- You've got a lot of work to do.

Oh, yeah.
Libby says hi.
You really think that thing's gonna work?
Rose, I told you a hundred times.
Of course it's gonna work.
Yes.
I worked hard on it.
It's better than rubbing two sticks together.
Well, I heard that's what you're supposed to do with it.
Yeah?
Well, I think this is gonna work better, all right?
Well, I think you got too much wood here in the inside.
That's gonna smother the leaves.
Rose, if you don't have enough wood, the leaves just burn out.
Fire?
Who cares about fire?
Any minute the sky could light up, and who the hell knows what could happen this time?
Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control.
You are either gonna help or be quiet!

Welcome back, Dr. wizard.
- I think it's Mr. wizard.
- Shut up.
You've been gone for two hours.
What the hell were you doing?
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
I'm sorry.
I...
left my pack in the jungle and I was coming back and I-I-I just--it was a while before I realized that I was just...
uh, I was really lost.
Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?
- I don't know.
- Well, you at least got a plan?
I think we should take the zodiac, head to a shipping lane.
No.
No, no, no.
We can't just sail out on any course.
For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing, and, uh, to do that...
I need to determine where we are now... in time.
And what are the rest of us supposed to do?
I'm gonna go find us something to eat.
And how are you planning on doing that?
Don't worry about it.
I guess we'll get the water.
Dude, wake up!
Come on.
I can't do this on my own!
I promise I'll pay you back.
Wait right here.
Shih tzus?
I like shih tzus.

You're good luck.
Sorry.

Okay.
Okay, we're outta here.
Mommy, I wanna go home.
Look at your book, baby.
Hello?
I-I can't believe it's you.
No.
Hi.
How are you?
Wait, you're in L.A.?
Of course I can meet, yeah.
What...
I know exactly where that is.
I'll be there in half an hour.
Mommy, where are we going?
To see a friend.
Are you looking for your pills, Jack?
I flushed them down the toilet.
Thank you.

All the cobra's business.

- the dragon lady of van nuys?
- Yeah.
I'm here to capture the scorpion, so if you've got a problem with that, you can go work stage 3.
She's hit!
Hey, dad.
How's it going?
...the news?
No.
I just got up.
Why, are you wanted again?
Uh, yeah.
Kind of.
- Is mom here?
- No, she's out shopping.
Hey, set him over here.
- Oh, man, he's out.
- Is he... breathing?
Barely.
What happened?
- He got shot by a dart.
- A dart?
What, were you in the zoo or something?
- No, we were at the safe house.
- The safe house?
Sayid took me there to protect me.
Then these two guys jumped at him, they shot him with darts, and now he's- he's in a coma or... something.
Hugo, this doesn't make sense.
And what are you doing out of the mental institution?
Sayid pulled me out.
I'm in danger.
We both are.
Danger from who?
I'm not sure exactly.
Hello?
Mr. and Mrs. Reyes?
L.A.P.D. Can you open the gate, please?
Just what kind of trouble are you in?
Dad, please!
Just don't tell 'em I'm here!
All right, but then you're gonna tell me the truth.
Well, give us a call if you hear anything.
You killed three people?
- No.
Sayid did.
- Oh.
Well, that's better.
Come on.
Let's get him to the couch.
He saved me.
I think we should call a lawyer right now.
No, no, no.
We can't go public.
They're after us.
Who?
Who is after you?
I don't know.
Sayid knows.
He can explain.
Sayid ain't explaining nothing.
We need to get him to a hospital.
Did you not hear me?
People are trying to kill us.
We go to a hospital, they'll find us!
Like--like "The Godfather." It's the last place you go.
Everyone knows it.
They-- they smother you with pillows and make it look like an accident.
Sayid, please wake up!
That's not gonna work.
We need a doctor.
I think I know what to do.
Mommy, mommy, can I push the button?
Sure you can, sweetie.
But we're all the way to the top, okay?
So I want you to press number 3-1.
You see it?
You see it?
Okay.
You get it. 3-1.
Yeah!
That's the one!
You pressed it!
You pressed it!
Hi.
Hello, Kate.
Have a nice day.
I'll be right with you.
Hello, Ben.
If it's the porterhouse you're looking for, we're out.
No, no porterhouse.
I do, however, have something very important in my van, Jill, and I need you to watch it for me.
- Is it what I think it is?
- It is.
He'll be safe with me.
- Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in yet?
Yeah, everything's moving right on schedule.
- How's it going with Shephard?
- He's with us.
Really?
What'd you do, bribe him with some pills?
Cut the man some slack.
He's been through a lot.
We all have.
Right.
Of course.
Sorry.
So keep him safe, Jill.
Because if you don't... everything we're about to do... won't matter at all.
Oh, you got it!
You got it!
You got it!
- You got it.
You got it.
- All right!
Finally we got-
Why did you do that?
Because you're supposed to fan the flame, Rose.
I thought you said you knew how to start a fire.
And I thought you said you didn't care.
I care about surviving.
I think you need to take a time-out, Neil.
- You'll get it, Bernard.
You will.
- Yeah.
All right.
Just- just try again.
Give me one second.
I got you something.
I found these in the jungle.
- Look at that.
Thank you.
- There was only two, but I thought we could both do with a bite to eat.
Thank you very much, very much.
You all right?
I just can't seem to shake this bloody headache.
Well...
I'm sure it'll pass.
No, it's not just that.
It's the weirdest thing.
Earlier, I was...
I was thinking about my mom, and all of sudden, I-I couldn't remember her maiden name.
I mean, isn't that odd?
Don't worry about it.
Listen, all of us have been under a lot of stress.
Okay?
Daniel...
Do you know what's happening to me?
Dinner!
That's great!
Wow!
Where'd you get that?
I found it.
What do you mean you "found" it?
It died in the jungle.
I found it.
Don't worry.
It's fine.
It's only been dead three hours.
What?
Who's got a knife?
A knife?
You need a knife?
Oh, it's over by the Cuisinart next to the stove.
What's your problem?
My problem is, we don't have a knife.
W-we don't have anything.
And it wouldn't even matter if we did, 'cause Bernie the dentist can't even start a fire.
Hey, ease up there, Frogurt.
It's Neil, you inbred.
And I'm not gonna ease up, 'cause I'm tired and I'm hungry and I'm screwed!
- We're all screwed!
- Calm down, Neil.
We're gonna get through this.
How are any of us gonna get through this?
!
Did you hear what I just said?
!
We can't even get fire!
Run!
Come on!
Split up!
Everybody, get to the creek!
Ow!
Dan!
Keep moving!
- Come on.
He's dead.
- No...
Come on!
You wanna be dead, too?
!
Come on!
There's nothing you could have done.
We gotta go now!
Dude, the cops are on a stakeout?
You just escaped from a mental institution.
There's dead bodies everywhere!
Of course they're on a stakeout!
They think you're crazy enough to come back home.
S-so are you...
Crazy?
Do you think I am?
Well, either that or you're lying to me.
I'm not crazy, and I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.
Well, what is it?
Why is there a dead Pakistani on my couch?
!
He's not dead, ma.
Well, he's not breathing.
He's not?
!
It's okay, Carmen.
We have a plan.
A plan?
What are you talking about?
He is breathing... kind of.
Dad, we gotta go now.
Hugo, what's happening?
Mom, please!
No "mom, please" me!
Why are you all over the news?
Do you know what they are telling about you?
Yeah, mom.
I know.
Look, everything's gonna make sense.
I promise.
It better!
Officers.
So how long are you in L.A.?
Just a few days.
I have some business to attend to.
But I wanted to see you.
Here it is.
Her name's Ji Yeon.
Here's a baby picture.
Oh!
She's beautiful.
Thank you.
She's with her grandmother in Seoul.
I hope some day you get to meet her.
It would be nice to see her and Aaron play together.
Yeah.
Kate?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Are you?
Somebody knows we're lying.
What?
Some lawyers came to see me.
Who?
Two men.
They came to my house and they asked for a blood sample.
Some kind of lawsuit.
They wanted to test to see if...
To see if Aaron's my son.
Who did these lawyers represent?
I don't know.
They wouldn't tell me who their client is.
Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.
How do you know?
Because if they were, they would just do it.
They wouldn't come to you in private.
They don't care that we're lying.
They just want Aaron.
But who... who would do that?
We--
I don't know, but you need to take care of them.
What do you mean, "take care of them?"
Wouldn't you do anything you had to in order to keep Aaron?
What kind of a person do you think I am?
Jin!
Jin!
The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.
You get the baby on the chopper.
I'll get Jin.
Like you did on the freighter.
You told me to get on the helicopter, and you said you'd get Jin.
We gotta get outta here!
Sun, I hope you don't think...
But you did what you had to do.
And if you hadn't... we probably all would've died instead of just my husband.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I...
I don't blame you.
So...
How's Jack?
Hugo said I could trust you.
I wasn't so sure, but he swore I could, so...
Can I?
Yes.
Of course.
All right.
What happened to him?
Hugo said he got hit with some dart.
Must've been some drugs or something.
- And where is Hurley right now?
- At our house, freaking out.
Let me get my car.
Help me move him over.
I'm gonna have to get him to the hospital.
No.
No, H-Hugo said that whoever did this, they'll come back after him.
All due respect, Mr. Reyes, but you brought him to me, so I'm gonna do what I think is best for Sayid.
All right, fine.
Take him to the hospital.
But with all due respect to you, Dr. Shephard, when this is over, you're gonna do something for me.
What?
Stay away from Hugo.
Whatever it is you talked him into, something tells me you don't have his best interests at heart.
So stay away from my son.
Hello?
Ben...
You'll never guess who just showed up at my door.
Who?
Sayid.
Who is Sayid?
I thought he was your friend.
He is my friend...
But he's also got this double life where he does crazy ninja moves and spy stuff.
But he's a good guy.
A good guy doesn't kill three men.
A good guy doesn't kill any men.
- Mom.
- Don't "mom" me.
You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.
The news thinks you did this.
And if the news does, everyone does.
Why is this happening?
How can anybody want to hurt you?
I don't know.
Tell your mother the truth.
We lied, ma.
What do you mean, you lied?
All of us - the Oceanic Six, we lied about what happened after the crash.
And what did happen?
Okay.
See, we did crash, but it was on this crazy island.
And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue.
And there was a smoke monster, and then there were other people on the island.
We called them The Others, and they started attacking us.
And we found some hatches, and there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or...
Well, I was never really clear on that.
But...
The Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches.
That was the Dharma Initiative, but they were all dead.
The Others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us.
And then we teamed up with the Others, because some worse people were coming on a freighter.
Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us.
So we stole their helicopter and we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up.
And we couldn't go back to the island because it disappeared.
So then we crashed into the ocean, and we floated there for a while until a boat came and picked us up.
And by then, there were six of us.
That part was true.
But the...
But the rest of the people... who were on the plane,
they're still on that island.
I believe you.
I don't understand you, but I believe you.
A lot of people died, ma.
And now this bad stuff is happening because...
We shouldn't have lied.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just stepped on something.
Something jammed...
Son of a bitch.
We should keep moving.
We gotta hook up with everybody at the creek.
It's a long creek, James.
Which part?
I don't know.
The wet part.
Sorry if my plan's not up to others' stan--
Who were those people?
Are they yours?
Did they shoot the arrows?
You want me to crawl out there and ask 'em?
You don't have to be a wiseass.
I'm just trying--
What are you doing on our island?
!
Son of a bitch.
Come on, Sayid.
Come on.
Sayid.
It--it's... it's Jack.
It's okay.
It's all right.
You're okay.
You're all right.
What happened?
You're fine.
You're in the hospital.
Hurley's father brought you to me.
Hurley's father?
Sayid, you've been attacked.
Where's Hurley?
He's at his parents' house.
Who's with him?
I don't know.
His mother, maybe?
Does anyone else know he's there?
Hello, Hugo.
Get away from me.
Get away!
Hugo, I know you're in trouble, and I can assure you I've taken care of everything.
I have a car waiting for us out back.
The police didn't see me come in.
I can get you out of here.
No way, dude.
Sayid warned me about you.
I'm taking you to Sayid.
He's with Jack.
That's why I'm here, Hugo.
Jack called me.
How else would I know that they're together?
No.
You're--you're playing one of your mind games.
They would never trust you.
In their defense, I'm not an easy person to trust.
But they came around when they realized that we all want the same thing.
And what's that?
To go back to the island.
Come with us, Hugo... and this'll be over.
You can stop hiding.
You can stop worrying about the stories and the deceptions.
If you come with me, you won't ever have to lie again.
Please.
Let me help you.
Never, dude.
Hey!
Hey, you got me!
That's right, you got me!
That's right!
I'm the killer!
Stop!
police!
Face your back towards me!
Slowly drop down to your knees!
I'm the murderer, I killed four people.
Three people.
However many are dead, I killed them.
I killed them.
I killed them all.
J-just-- just get me away from here.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- You have the right to speak to an attorney
Just get me out of here.
and to have one present during any questioning...
If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you.
I'm gonna make this quite simple for you.
You're gonna tell me what you're doing, how many of you there are and how you got here.
Let her go.
Unless you're answering my questions, don't speak.
I want you to tell me everything or I'll cut off her other hand.
What?
!
- "Other"?
- The first one isn't negotiable.
It's just to illustrate how serious I am.
No!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Chill out!
We're not supposed to be here.
Something's happening to the island.
- There are these flashes-
- Do it!
No!
Wait a second!
I'll tell you whatever you want to know!
- Do it!
- No!
James.
Juliet.
Nice to see you.
Any luck?
Yes.
Really?
Really.
What about you?
I'm having some... difficulties.
Well, you better get busy...
because you only have 70 hours.
What?
No, no.
That's not enough time.
I need at least--
What you need is irrelevant.
70 hours is what you've got.
Look, I lost Reyes tonight.
So what happens if I can't get them all to come back?
Then God help us all.
- Dude, they'll find out.
- Not if we stick to the story.
I don't know, Jack.
It could be a risk.
It's the only way.
We have to do this.
They're still at it, huh?
Look, we're running out of time.
We've gotta make a decision now.
So are we all OK with this?
This is a decision that will affect the rest of our lives.
I'm not taking it lightly.
Kate?
Yeah.
Sun?
- Frank?
- What?
Sorry you got dragged in.
We need to know you're with us.
Whatever you guys decide I'll just roll with.
Hurley, what about you?
I don't think we should lie, dude.
We need to protect the people that we left behind, Hurley.
How does lying protect them?
It protects them from Charles Widmore.
The guy hired people to kill us.
He faked a plane crash.
Telling him the truth, he's gonna leave them alone?
Look, he's your dad, right?
Can't you, like, call him off?
There's no calling my father off.
He'll never find them.
The island disappeared.
We all saw it, it's gone.
You think anyone's gonna believe that?
Believe any of it?
They're gonna think you're crazy.
Not if someone backs me up.
Sayid, come on.
They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth, but what if we all do?
If we can stick together, we can make them believe us.
I don't want to spend my life lying.
Do you?
No.
But...
I don't believe we have a better choice.
I'm sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.
You know what, dude?
I'm gonna remember this.
And someday you're gonna need my help and I'm telling you right now you're not getting it.
Wake up, Sayid!
Sayid!
Sayid, wake up!
Sayid!
No, no, no, no, no!
What do I do?
What am I supposed to do?
!
OK, OK, OK.
Just stay calm.
What the hell were you thinking?
- Ana Lucia?
- You were driving like a maniac.
Now why'd you pull over?
I just...
- I thought...
- You didn't think.
What if I were real?
What if a real cop stopped you?
They have pictures of you covered in blood with a gun in your hand.
Actually, it's ketchup.
We went through a drive-through, and...
Bro, you need to pull it together.
You've got a lot of work to do.
- I do?
- Let's start with the basics.
First off, you need new clothes.
Then you need to go to a safe place.
And take Sayid to somebody you trust.
- You getting all this?
- Yeah.
Then get to it.
And stay away from the cops.
Do not get arrested.
Thanks, Ana Lucia.
Oh, yeah.
Libby says hi.
Well... you heard her.
You really think that thing's gonna work?
Of course it's gonna work.
It's better than rubbing two sticks together.
- That's what you're supposed to do.
- This will work better.
You've got too much wood inside, gonna smother the leaves.
If you don't have enough wood, the leaves burn out.
Fire?
Who cares about fire?
Any minute the sky could light up.
- Who knows what'll happen this time?
- Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control.
Help or be quiet.
- Whose shirt is this?
- Mine.
- Can I have it?
- What does it matter?
- We're all gonna be dead by sundown.
- I'll take that as a yes, Frogurt.
- It's Neil.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Still in one piece?
- As far as I can tell.
I figured it would disappear with our stuff.
I guess whatever we had with us when we moved is along for the ride.
- What?
- Look who's back.
- Welcome back, Dr Wizard.
- I think it's Mr Wizard.
Shut up.
You've been gone for two hours.
- What the hell were you doing?
- You're right.
Sorry.
I left my pack in the jungle, and I was coming back...
It was a while before I realised that I was really lost.
Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?
- I don't know.
- You got a plan?
We should take the Zodiac, head to a shipping lane.
No.
We can't just sail out on any course.
For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing.
And to do that I need to determine where we are now in time.
What are the rest of us supposed to do?
I'll go find something to eat.
- How are you planning on doing that?
- Don't worry about it.
I guess we'll get the water.
Dude, wake up.
I can't do this on my own.
I promise I'll pay you back.
Wait right here.
- Shih tzus?
- I like shih tzus.
It looks like you "heart" them.
- Rough night?
- Yeah.
- Your friend's pretty wasted.
- Yeah.
I know you from somewhere, don't I?
No.
I think I do.
Yeah, you definitely look familiar.
- I just have one of those faces?
- You're lying.
I don't believe in lying.
I remember!
You're the guy who won the lottery.
And you crashed in that plane.
No, I must look like him.
You're him.
Buy a ticket here.
You win, we get a commission.
- You're good luck.
- Sorry.
Wrong dude.
Keep the change.
OK.
OK, we're out of here.
Mommy, I wanna go home.
Look at your book, baby.
Hello?
I can't believe it's you.
No.
Hi, how are you?
Wait.
You're in LA?
Of course I can meet.
Where...
I know exactly where that is.
I'll be there in a half an hour.
Mommy, where are we going?
To see a friend.
Looking for your pills, Jack?
I flushed them down the toilet.
Thank you.
I was just going to do that myself.
Yeah, I figured you were.
- Going somewhere?
- I'm checking out.
Where are we going?
You're going home and find yourself a suitcase.
If there's anything in this life you want, pack it in there because you're never coming back.
Good.
Good.
- I'll pick you up in six hours.
- And where will you be going?
John's casket is outside in a carpet van.
I need to move it somewhere safe.
Safe?
He's dead, isn't he?
I'll see you in six hours, Jack.
Previously on Exposé:
Looks like the Scorpion is taking over all the Cobra's business.
You want me to work with Tsunami, the Dragon Lady of Van Nuys?
- Yeah.
- I'm here to capture the Scorpion, so if you got a problem with that, you can go work stage three.
She's hit!
Someone call an ambulance...
Hey, Dad.
How's it going?
- Have you seen the news?
- No, I just got up.
- You on it again?
- Yeah.
Kind of.
- Is Mom here?
- No, she's out shopping.
Set him over here.
- Oh, man, he's out.
- Is he breathing?
Barely.
What happened?
- He got shot by a dart.
- A dart?
Where were you, the zoo?
- No, we were at the safe house.
- The safe house?
Sayid took me there.
To protect me.
These two guys jumped out and shot him with darts, and now he's in a coma.
This doesn't make sense.
What are you doing out of the institution?
Sayid pulled me out.
I'm in danger, we both are.
Danger from who?
I'm not sure, exactly.
- Hello?
- Mr Reyes?
LAPD.
Could you open the gate, please?
- What kind of trouble are you in?
- Don't tell them I'm here.
All right.
But you're gonna tell me the truth.
- You killed three people?
- No.
- Sayid did.
- Oh, well, that's better.
- Let's get him to the couch.
- He saved me.
- I think we should call a lawyer now.
- No, no, no.
We can't go public.
They're after us.
- Who?
Who is after you?
- I don't know.
- Sayid knows.
He can explain.
- Sayid ain't explaining nothing.
We need to get him to a hospital.
Did you hear me?
People are trying to kill us!
If we go there, they'll find us.
Like The Godfather.
It's the last place you go.
Everyone knows it.
They smother you with pillows and make it look like an accident.
Wake up!
That's not gonna work.
We need a doctor.
I think I know what to do.
- Mommy, can I push the button?
- Sure, you can, sweetie.
We're going all the way to the top, OK?
I want you to press number 31.
See it?
You see it?
OK, 31.
Yeah!
You pressed it.
You pressed it.
Hi.
Hello, Kate.
Have a nice day.
I'll be right with you.
Hello, Ben.
If it's the porterhouse you're looking for, we're out.
No, no porterhouse.
I do, however, have something important in my van, Jill.
- I need you to watch it for me.
- Is it what I think it is?
It is.
He'll be safe with me.
- Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in?
- Everything's moving on schedule.
- How's it going with Shephard?
- He's with us.
- Really?
Did you bribe him with pills?
- Cut the man some slack.
- He's been through a lot.
We all have.
- Right.
Of course.
Sorry.
So keep him safe, Jill.
Because if you don't everything we're about to do won't matter at all.
You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it!
- Why did you do that?
- You're supposed to fan it.
- You said you knew how to start a fire.
- You said you didn't care.
- I care about surviving.
- You need to take a timeout, Neil.
You'll get it, Bernard.
You will.
Just... just try again.
Hey.
Hi.
Give me one second.
I got you something.
- Found these in the jungle.
- Thank you.
There was only two.
I thought we could both do with a bite to eat.
Thank you very much.
You all right?
I just can't seem to shake this bloody headache.
- I'm sure it'll pass.
- It's not just that.
It was the weirdest thing, earlier I was...
I was thinking about my mom, and... all of a sudden I couldn't remember her maiden name.
- Isn't that odd?
- Don't worry about it.
All of us have been under a lot of stress.
OK?
Daniel do you know what's happening to me?
Dinner!
That's great!
Where did you get that?
I found it.
What do you mean, you found it?
It died in the jungle.
I found it.
Don't worry, it's fine.
It's only been dead three hours.
- What?
- Who's got a knife?
A knife?
You need a knife?
It's by the Cuisinart next to the stove.
- What's your problem?
- My problem is we don't have a knife.
We don't have anything.
It wouldn't matter if we did 'cause the dentist can't start a fire.
- Ease up there, Frogurt.
- It's Neil, you inbred!
And I'm not gonna ease up, 'cause I'm tired,
- hungry and screwed!
We're all screwed!
- Calm down.
- We're gonna get through this.
- How?
!
Didn't you hear what I just said!
?
We can't even get fire!
Run!
Come on.
Get up, get up!
Come on, split up!
Everybody get to the creek!
Dan!
Keep moving!
Come on, he's dead.
Come on, you wanna be dead too?
Come on!
There's nothing you could have done.
We got to go now!
- Dude, they're on a stakeout?
- You escaped from a mental institution.
There are dead bodies!
Of course they're on a stakeout.
They think you're crazy enough to come home.
So are you crazy?
Do you think I am?
Either that or you're lying to me.
Well, I'm not crazy.
And I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.
What is it?
Why is there a dead Pakistani on my couch?
He's not dead, Ma.
Well, he's not breathing.
He's not?
!
- It's OK, Carmen, we have a plan.
- A plan?
What are you talking about?
He is breathing.
Kind of.
Dad, we gotta go now!
- What is happening?
- Mom, please!
No "Mom, please" me!
Why are you all over the news?
Do you know what they are saying?
Yeah, I know.
Everything's gonna make sense, I promise.
It better!
Officers.
So how long are you in LA?
Just a few days.
I have some business to attend to.
But I wanted to see you.
Here it is.
Her name's Ji Yeon.
Here's a baby picture.
- She's beautiful.
- Thank you.
She's with her grandmother in Seoul.
I hope someday you get to meet her.
It would be nice to see her and Aaron play together.
Yeah.
Kate, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you?
- Somebody knows we're lying.
- What?
- Some lawyers came to see me.
- Who?
Two men.
They came to my house and they asked for a blood sample.
Some kind of lawsuit.
They wanted to test to see if...
To see if Aaron's my son.
Who do these lawyers represent?
I don't know.
They wouldn't tell me who their client is.
Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.
- How do you know?
- If they were, they would just do it.
They wouldn't come to you in private.
They don't care we're lying.
They want Aaron.
But who would do that?
I don't know, but you need to take care of them.
What do you mean, "take care of them"?
Wouldn't you do anything you had to in order to keep Aaron?
What kind of a person do you think I am?
The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.
Get the baby on the chopper, I'll get Jin.
Like you did on the freighter.
You told me to get on the helicopter, and you said you'd get Jin.
Sun, I hope you don't think...
You did what you had to do.
And if you hadn't we probably all would have died, instead of just my husband.
I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry.
I don't blame you.
So... how's Jack?
Hugo said I could trust you.
I wasn't so sure.
But he swore I could.
So... can I?
- Yes.
Of course.
- All right.
- What happened to him?
- Hugo said he got hit with some dart.
- Must've been some drugs.
- And where is Hurley?
At our house, freaking out.
I'm gonna get my car, help me move him over.
- I have to get him to the hospital.
- No.
Hugo said whoever did this will come back.
All due respect, Mr Reyes, you brought him to me.
I'm gonna do what's best.
Fine.
Take him to the hospital.
All due respect, Dr Shephard, when this is over,
- you're gonna do something for me.
- What?
Stay away from Hugo.
Whatever you talked him into, you don't have his best interests at heart.
So stay away from my son.
Hello.
Ben... you'll never guess who just showed up at my door.
- Who?
- Sayid.
Who is Sayid?
I thought he was your friend.
He is my friend.
But he's also got this double life where he does crazy ninja moves and spy stuff.
- But he's a good guy.
- A good guy doesn't kill three men.
- A good guy doesn't kill any men.
- Mom...
Don't "Mom" me.
You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.
The news thinks you did this.
And if the news does, everyone does.
Why is this happening?
How can anybody want to hurt you?
I don't know.
Tell your mother the truth.
We lied, Ma.
- What do you mean, you lied?
- All of us.
The Oceanic Six.
We lied about what happened after the crash.
And what did happen?
OK.
See, we did crash.
But it was on this crazy island.
And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue.
There was a smoke monster and other people on the island.
We called them "the Others."
They started attacking us.
And we found hatches.
There was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or...
Well, I was never really clear on that.
The Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches.
That was the Dharma Initiative.
But the Others killed them.
Now they're trying to kill us.
And then we teamed up with the Others because worse people were coming.
Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us.
We stole their helicopter, flew to their freighter, but it blew up.
We couldn't go to the island.
It disappeared.
So we crashed in the ocean, and floated a while until a boat picked us up.
By then there were six of us.
That part was true.
But the re...
But the rest of the people who were on the plane...
They're still on that island.
I believe you.
I don't understand you, but I believe you.
A lot of people died, Ma.
Now this bad stuff is happening because...
Well...
We shouldn't have lied.
You OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just stepped on something.
Something jammed...
Son of a bitch.
Keep moving, we gotta hook up with everybody at the creek.
It's a long creek, James.
Which part?
The wet part.
Sorry if my plan's not up to Other...
Who were those people?
Were they yours?
- Did they shoot the arrows?
- Want me to crawl out and ask?
You don't have to be a wise-ass.
I'm just trying to...
What are you doing on our island?
Respiratory therapist to ICU.
Respiratory therapist...
Come on.
Son of a bitch.
Come on, Sayid.
Come on.
Sayid!
Sayid!
It's me.
It's Jack.
It's OK.
It's all right.
You're OK.
You're all right.
What happened?
You're fine.
You're in the hospital.
Hurley's father brought you to me.
Hurley's father?
He said you'd been attacked.
- Where's Hurley?
- He's at his parents' house.
- Who's with him?
- I don't know.
His mother, maybe?
Does anyone else know he's there?
Hello, Hugo.
Get away from me!
Get away!
Hugo, I know you're in trouble.
And I can assure you, I've taken care of everything.
I have a car waiting for us out back.
The police didn't see me.
I can get you out of here.
No way, dude.
Sayid warned me about you.
I'm taking you to Sayid.
He's with Jack.
That's why I'm here.
Jack called me.
How else would I know that they're together?
No!
You're playing one of your mind games.
They would never trust you.
In their defence, I'm not an easy person to trust.
But they came around when they realised that we all want the same thing.
And what's that?
To go back to the island.
Come with us, Hugo.
And this will be over.
You can stop hiding.
You can stop worrying about the stories and deceptions.
If you come with me you won't ever have to lie again.
Please...
Let me help you.
Never, dude.
You got me!
That's right, you got me!
- That's right, I'm the killer!
- Stop!
Police!
I'm crazy!
I'm a murderer!
I killed four people!
Three people...
However many are dead, I killed them!
I killed them all.
Just get me away from here!
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an attorney...
Just get me out of here.
If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you.
I'm gonna make this simple.
Tell me what you're doing, how many of you there are and how you got here.
- Let her go.
- Unless you're answering questions, don't speak.
Tell me, or I cut off her other hand.
- What?
- Other?
The first one isn't negotiable, it's just to illustrate how serious I am.
Hold on.
Chill out!
We're not supposed to be here.
- The island, there are these flashes...
- Do it.
I'll tell you what you want to know!
- Do it!
- No!
James.
Juliet.
Nice to see you.
- Any luck?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Really.
- What about you?
- I'm having some difficulties.
Well, you'd better get busy 'cause you only have 70 hours.
That's not enough!
I need at least...
What you need is irrelevant.
Seventy hours is what you've got.
Look, I lost Reyes tonight.
What happens if I can't get them all to come back?
Then God help us all.
(GROANS)
Oh!
Hold on.
I'm coming.
All right.
Increased productivity through ergonomically beneficial surroundings.
Oh.
In the spirit of ergonomy.
Is that even a word?
Ergonomy is the applied science of equipment design, Michael.
Okay.
Well, then, in the spirit of origami, you ever think about making your backseat into a bed, KITT?
I'm afraid you'd be tempted to invite strangers.
You mean, hoochies, KITT.
Undesirable females, yes.
This puppy has got a cooler built into the armrest.
And a remote for the big screen.
(SPORTS ANNOUNCER CHATTERING)
Ah.
That is sweet.
Chair belongs on the other side.
I like it where it is.
Move it, stretch.
The Chinese system of Feng Shui would indicate that
Zoe's placement provides for better chi.
MIKE:
Very Zen of you, KITT.
We could use a little more eastern philosophy around here.
See?
Better chi.
Chop, chop.
Who died and made you boss?
That would be Alex Torres.
I see you're already enjoying your downtime.
Oh, I have not yet begun to enjoy.
(SARAH CHUCKLES)
Going anywhere special?
Oh, yeah.
Little sentimental journey.
Wait.
We get to go somewhere?
Outlet mall.
Spa day.
You guys are kidding, right?
I am going to be mellow and get Zen.
You mean "we," Michael.
Yes, "we. " We are going, KITT.
Back to a special place.
Magical place.
Our own little happy place.
Michael is taking me to a bar.
(LAUGHS) Who would have thunk it?
I want to go to a bar!
Oh, no.
Not just any bar.
Sonny's.
Oh, I get it.
Your dad took me there for my first beer.
And his dad took him there for his.
It's a neighborhood institution.
Cold brew, beer nuts, live music.
Run by Sonny Nelson.
Amazing bartender.
Even better guy.
I haven't been there in years, but I can tell you that there is no better place to de-stress.
(SHRIEKS) Sounds awesome.
I'm a veritable cornucopia of stress.
From what I remember, Sonny had a daughter.
Oh, yeah.
Julie Nelson.
She went to med school, I think.
Somewhere back east.
Right.
Have a great time.
(SIGHS) You too, guys.
Initiating launch prep.
Hello?
Hey.
We'd better tell him.
Or else he might have a breakdown.
Somebody, please!
Say something.
Look, we're going on rotation.
Everyone's going to get a chance to decompress.
First, Mike's going to take a couple of days, and then you and then Zoe and then me.
When's this all going to start?
Ask your boss.
Okay, not funny.
KITT:
No, Billy.
Funny.
(LAUGHING)
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
(GIRL EXCLAIMING)
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Little rougher than I remembered.
KITT:
I must admit, I'm somewhat concerned for you, Michael.
I'll be okay, KITT.
Just stay close.
And be Zen.
I will try.
(SINGING) You're just a man
Wait, because I'm inside out now
Crazy, you know I'm not outside, around
Try, you can find my body of questions on your own
Falling intentions
Brings me from my misery
Just as I stand up
If you're here about the bouncer job, you're too pretty.
(LAUGHS) No.
I'm actually here to see Sonny.
Yeah, right.
If you're a collection agent, you can get in line.
I'm sorry?
Sonny's dead.
What?
Michael?
Oh, my God.
Michael.
(LAUGHS) Hey.
Julie!
I didn't know you were friends.
Is it true?
About your dad?
Yeah.
Car accident.
Three months ago.
I am so sorry.
Thank you.
Michael, a nefarious character directly behind you is attempting to steal $20 from the bar.
What the hell is going on around here?
I wish I knew.
We've had three fires in the last six weeks.
Fights, every night.
The cops have been closing us down.
What can I do to help?
Can you fix the mess at the door?
(MAN SHOUTING)
Sometimes, Eddie's a little bit too nice for his own good.
Big Eddie's at the door?
Mmm-hmm.
Eddie's a pacifist.
I know.
(LAUGHING)
Man!
Hey.
The dude who left this unattended is going to be taking public transportation for a while.
KITT:
Please step back from the vehicle.
(LAUGHS) Hey.
Homeboy has got one of those talking alarms.
Yeah.
At least you'd think they'd give it some badass voice, like, "Step back, clown, before you get smoked!"
(LAUGHS)
Michael, two felons are eyeing me suspiciously.
Permission to administer non-lethal electric shock.
What did I say about Zen, KITT?
Restraint is the word of the day.
All right, Michael.
(GROANS)
(LAUGHING) Oh, my God, dude.
You just got schooled!
Michael, may I suggest you use restraint, as well?
Watch me.
(LAUGHING)
That's $10 each, please.
Well, I get comped at every club on the strip.
Why would I pay to go into this place?
Hey.
This constant pushing is not helping your cause.
Ooh.
(GRUNTING)
Nearly everyone at the door is armed.
All right.
You're forcing my hand.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Could you hold on one moment, please?
Mike?
Hey, Eddie.
What are you doing over here?
I've been wondering the same thing.
All right.
Any day now, dummy.
I didn't want to resort to violence, but I feel as though I've reached my limit.
You mind a little assist?
Because...
Ooh.
You're violating the cardinal rule of the door.
You never tell the bad guy what you're going to do before you do it.
Screw this.
We're going in.
(GRUNTS)
(CROWD SHOUTING)
KITT:
He's got a gun in his waistband, Michael.
(GRUNTING)
Back up!
That was not smart.
Good night, gentlemen.
Let's go.
Anybody fighting inside, walk them outside.
Take them one at a time.
Yell if you need any help.
Thanks, Mike.
Michael, I was harassed by two men.
Me, too.
Get Sarah.
How many you knock back so far?
KITT, don't let him drive.
Sonny's dead.
Oh, no.
A car accident.
And the place isn't right.
Mysterious fires, rough crowd.
A mess.
Sonny's never was in the best neighborhood.
Maybe you romanticized it a little.
I'm telling you something's going on here, Sarah.
I need your help.
Sure.
Anything.
KITT, tap into the local municipal database.
Send the accident report, arson files, and anything else you can dig up back to the SSC.
You guys getting this?
Yeah, yeah.
We're on it.
So, what are you doing there?
I'm the new bouncer.
Bouncer?
Kick ass.
Be careful.
Let's get to work on those fires.
No, we should start on the car accident.
Begin a broad-spectrum search.
(SCOFFS) I'm sorry, what?
Sarah was only half joking.
She runs the place because Dr. Graiman left her nine figures.
Mike and KITT do the outside stuff, and I'm in charge of all this glory right here.
(LAUGHS) You?
You're my boss?
Haven't you noticed I boss you around almost all day, every day?
Yeah, but it's part of our whole fun little dynamic.
No, it's me being your boss.
I have multiple advanced degrees.
I speak nine languages and I have a card that gets me discounts at participating Red Lobster restaurants.
Okay.
If this wasn't so ludicrous, it would be ludicrous.
All right.
I'm on the accident, you look into the fires, and we'll see who's right soon enough.
(LAUGHS)
It's on.
(LAUGHING) It's all the way on.
(WHOOPING)
All right, folks.
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
Come on.
Let's go.
Come back tomorrow.
(CHUCKLES) Let's go.
(CHATTERING)
Didn't think you'd last the night.
Under-promise and over-deliver.
I'm Mike.
Robin.
Beer?
Nothing like a cold beer right after last call.
(CHUCKLES)
Michael helped my dad 86 some tough customers back in the day.
Yeah, it was more him than me.
Sonny was a sweet guy, but he had one hot temper.
Well, thank God you showed up tonight.
I'm barely hanging on.
ROBIN:
It was never like this before.
It's like somebody wants her out of here.
Any idea who that might be?
Maybe I'm not cut out for this like my dad.
I seriously doubt it's you.
Did you two have a thing?
Robin, come on.
Julie was a college girl.
On to bigger and better things.
She thought I was a punk.
You know, the kind of guy that hangs out in bars.
ROBIN:
You didn't answer my question.
She calls you Michael, but you introduced yourself as Mike.
Are either of you going to cop to prior nookie, or what?
(SIGHS)
Go on.
(LAUGHS)
You think you might be able to stick around a little while longer?
I'm sure I can squeeze it into my schedule.
Good.
Staff meeting.
Tomorrow morning. 11:00 a. m.
(CHUCKLES) Good night, Julie.
Good night, Michael.
See you tomorrow, Mike.
Night, Eddie.
(SIGHS)
What?
Nothing.
You getting shut out?
(SIGHS)
Three fires in the last two months of unknown origin.
Police did an arson investigation and came up empty.
But you have a theory.
Spontaneous combustion.
Or maybe it's the tiny, chubby gnomes whose thighs rub together and make sparks when they wear corduroy?
I suppose you're doing better with the car accident.
Patience, grasshopper.
Patience.
Anybody else bother you?
I was unmolested the remainder of the evening.
Why do you have to use words like "unmolested"?
Can't you just say, "It was all okay"?
I managed to practice the restraint you recommended, but it wasn't easy.
Well, I'm proud of you, KITT.
Michael, is it possible you are idealizing Sonny's a bit?
Maybe you are remembering it the way you want it to be.
Come on.
You, too?
Thomas Wolfe wrote a novel about this phenomenon.
It was called You Can't Go Home Again.
Still think I'm idealizing?
Michael, someone is trapped in the fire.
Open up!
It's Eddie!
Get me out of here!
There's a fire!
Help!
Oh, no!
Help!
Come on, man!
Please!
Open up!
Somebody open up!
Where is he?
Michael, the pressurized CO 2 tanks have become dangerously overheated.
You must act now.
MIKE:
Do it.
Get in!
(YELLS)
KITT, CO2.
KITT:
The fire's out, Michael.
You okay?
KITT:
All of his vital signs are normal, Michael.
I'm going to have to ask you not to mention what you saw tonight to anyone.
Thank you.
That is the fourth fire in six weeks.
Doesn't sound much like an accident.
No.
It sounds like arson.
Look.
KITT can investigate while you go to your meeting.
She's hot, by the way.
Who?
I believe she means Julie, Michael.
I hadn't noticed.
You're a terrible liar.
Three months ago today, Julie's father takes his '68 Dodge out for a spin and ends up wrapping it around a telephone pole.
Anybody with him?
Nope.
Police report?
Same basic story.
(SIGHS)
Witnesses?
Cops say no.
But I found two blog entries from the neighborhood from the next day.
Both say they saw the car and heard nothing but a crash.
Okay, so it was an accident.
But you've got another theory.
Actually, I don't.
I've hit a dead end, literally and figuratively.
JULIE:
All right.
Let's get started.
First up, seems like we had another fire around closing last night.
Did anybody see anything?
ALL:
Mmm-mmm.
No?
Okay.
Hi, Phil.
Hey.
How's the nose?
It's broken.
I guess you didn't know who the hell you were assaulting.
Hey.
My son's mouth tends to get a step ahead of his brain.
Mike, isn't it?
Phil Driscoll.
Phil was an old friend of my dad's.
They were in a car club together.
(SIGHS) My son comes home with a broken nose,
I'd never expect to hear it happened at Sonny's.
Before I called the police or my lawyer, I wanted to hear your side.
Sir, I make it a general policy not to raise hands to anyone, unless they plan on throwing shots at me.
I should have broken your nose myself.
Are you kidding me, Pop?
(CLEARS THROAT) What's the old saying?
"Outside of your wife giving birth,
"nothing good ever happens at 2:00 a. m."
Nice to meet you, Mike.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Not at all.
Thanks for coming by.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES)
Creepy.
Come to Mama.
(KITT HUMMING)
Billy?
Zoe?
I'm analyzing the aftermath of the fire.
You certain it was arson?
Yes.
I have isolated the accelerant.
Whoever set the blaze left a chemically significant trail.
Can you follow it?
Not with my current software configuration.
BOTH:
Uploading new sniffer program now.
I'll do it.
Duh.
I'm already doing it.
Hello?
Hey.
Which one do you like better?
What's it for?
First amendment night.
Spoken word poetry and $2 Jager shots.
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech.
They teach you about the constitution in the army?
I thought it would be good to actually know what I was defending.
My dad called it the marinated microcosm.
Everybody's equal with a drink in their hand.
MIKE:
He was a hell of a guy.
Yeah.
Is that your grandfather?
(LAUGHS) Yep.
Built this building with his own two hands.
He still scares me.
(LAUGHS)
Bet he was one mean son of a bitch.
And then, some.
This bar was a soup kitchen in the Great Depression, a polling place every election, a shelter in three earthquakes...
My dad was even born here.
How come we never...
For starters, your dad kept a really big bat behind the bar.
It's still there, too.
Great.
I tried calling and emailing.
I even wrote you a letter.
Everything came back undeliverable.
Yeah.
Let's just say I got involved in some things that didn't turn out so well.
I was going to be an ophthalmologist.
Now, I run a bar.
(LAUGHS)
KITT:
Michael, I've discovered a faint chemical signature from the fire.
But we must follow its trail now before it dissipates completely.
I will see you tonight.
(JULIE LAUGHS)
Sonny's used to be a friendly neighborhood bar, right?
Mmm-hmm.
All of a sudden, it starts to get rougher.
I thought you were working on the fires.
I was.
But what if they're related?
What makes a crowd change?
New owner.
Neighborhood goes bad.
They water down the drinks.
Here's the greatest hits from the front door camera at Sonny's for the last three weeks.
Oh, he's cute.
He's also been in four fights.
So?
He's angry and he's cute.
So, he just started showing up at the bar recently, along with those four other dudes, who've also been getting into fights.
And they're also hot.
It's called coincidence.
It would be.
Except I followed them to the bar.
No twenties.
No credit cards.
Hundred dollar bills every time.
Maybe they're drug dealers.
Or maybe somebody's paying them to start trouble.
And how does this connect to the fires?
I don't know.
(SIGHS)
Hey.
There's your 'Stang, bro.
Still in the hood.
It's like he's teasing us.
I'd take that as a dare, I was you.
Yeah.
It's in the same family as methane, but it's getting fainter as we go.
He must have gotten out of his car here.
KITT:
You need to go hand-held.
KITT, you there?
Right behind you, Michael.
It just stops.
Whoever set that fire ended up here.
Phil Driscoll's office.
We traced him from the fire back to his father's office.
It's got to be Terry.
He definitely had the opportunity.
Yeah, and a broken nose is definitely motive.
KITT:
I'd say the motive would be embarrassment.
You made him look weak in front of a beautiful woman.
Yeah, but Terry's a couple tacos short of a combination plate.
You don't think he's capable?
I think he's a moron.
Hit me back if Billy and Zoe come up with anything.
Hey.
How's Julie Nelson?
Hanging in there.
(SINGING) Come, look around, sit down with us
Terry's a jerk, but he's not an arsonist.
I heard you went out with him.
Wow.
A bar is like ninth grade summer school, isn't it?
Yes.
It was once, and it was years ago.
So, maybe he was trying to get your attention.
Nothing like a two-alarm blaze to get a girl all hot and bothered.
Robin's looking.
Of course, she is.
So, what about Terry's father?
Why would Phil want to burn a place he offered to buy?
He offered to buy your bar?
After my dad was killed, he figured I couldn't handle the bar by myself.
And maybe he was right.
You do sit on a valuable piece of dirt.
A place like this is a drop in the bucket to a developer like Phil.
Believe me, he's doing it as a favor.
Sonny Nelson was driving his '68 Dodge the night of the accident.
Nice graphics.
Nice grill.
Thanks.
Where did you get this?
I recreated his route from the blog descriptions, then re-enacted the accident using KITT's 3D graphics software.
Nice work.
Wait.
I thought we established no foul play in the accident.
That's what the police said.
Not what I say.
He comes around this turn, hits the brakes, gets a little squirrelly, continues until he crashes.
SARAH:
At least we can see the accident.
But what don't we see?
Remember?
The bloggers said they heard nothing but a crash.
Skid marks.
Exactly.
He hit the brakes, but the car didn't skid.
No screeching, no skidding.
Because you think he lost his brakes?
Or somebody cut the brake line.
It's not proof.
You said, "Nice work. "
It's a simulation.
It's not evidence.
It won't hold up in court.
Which is why we need to find the real car.
EDDIE:
Hey, Mike.
You really made me think about things.
Introspection is good, Eddie.
I've always thought of you as sort of a simple guy.
And by simple, I mean straightforward, but not very complicated.
No offense intended.
None taken.
I set the fire last night.
I thought if I set it, and put it out, I'd be a hero.
But then, the back door locked on me.
I know.
Stupid, right?
And nobody put you up to it?
You saved my life.
Who are you really, Mike?
Just a guy trying to make things better.
(TIRES SCREECHING) 1968 Dodge Coronet.
I've uploaded tags and VIN number to KITT.
You've got to find that car.
Or what's left of it.
MIKE:
You know, I may have found a flaw in your logic, KITT.
Really?
Your assumption was whoever set the fire ended up at Phil Driscoll's office.
Based on the spectrographic analysis, that was correct.
But Eddie admitted he set it.
He could have gone to Driscoll's office after he left us, or he could have been lying.
No.
He was threatening to kick Terry Driscoll's ass, so I'm guessing he wouldn't be heading over to their place for a nightcap.
My gut says he was telling the truth.
It is possible the methane trail could be related to another incident or a person.
But outside of the fire, there seems to be no logical reason.
Holograms?
Really?
That's right.
(SIGHS) That was some seriously impressive shizz back there.
I know.
That's usually my department.
I know.
You kind of made me look bad.
I know.
That's why I got you something.
What?
Level Fourteen knows how to party.
"Botcraft Six.
Quest for Cyclops.
Hammer of Xerxes Seven. "
These aren't even out, yet.
I know.
The DMVsearch was unsuccessful.
What about junk yards?
Insurance companies?
Car collectors?
Maybe somebody bought it for parts.
I have broadened my research parameters, and may have come up with a possibility.
Great.
Where's the car?
The last place you ever would have expected.
(KITT HUMMING)
An art gallery?
You're kidding.
KITT:
The remains of Julie's father's car were purchased by an artist and installed as the centerpiece of an exhibit here.
A man died in that car.
Apparently, there is an artistic subculture especially fascinated by automobile crashes.
Outside their subculture, they're known as idiots, KITT.
Go ahead.
Touch it.
It helps you connect.
I call it Beautiful Agony.
Wow.
Where did you get it?
I scan the police blotter for fatal accidents.
Then, I buy the wrecks from the insurance company.
Yes.
Yes, I see.
I can tell that you're into it.
People who come right up to the car, it's as if they...
It's as if they want to connect to the moment of impact.
Well, it's just so, you know, visceral.
I'll let you remain in the moment, then.
Listen to it.
It will sing to you.
(VOCALIZING)
(EXCLAIMS)
Enjoy.
Ass clown.
KITT:
Michael, the brake system on a '68 Dodge Coronet has a fluid line running down the left side of the chassis.
I'm getting there now.
The brake lines have been cut.
It may have been severed in the crash.
No, this cut's too uniform.
Someone did this.
Zoe's right.
It was murder.
(VOCALIZING)
(BOTH VOCALIZING)
(MIMICS EXPLOSION)
(GUNS FIRING)
(GUNS FIRING)
Who the hell is shooting at me?
KITT:
The shots are coming from the bridge above.
What are you waiting for?
A written invitation?
Come get me.
On my way, Michael.
Cover me.
Scatter pattern.
Rapid fire will exhaust my ammunition supply in approximately seven seconds.
(CHUCKLES) Wow.
Seven seconds?
That's all you last?
That's 8,000 rounds, Michael.
Oh, it's fine.
I'm sure Sarah can fix it.
Start shooting.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(GROANS)
Got the wheel.
How many?
Two in pursuit.
And two attempting to block the roadway ahead.
And we are out of ammunition.
Okay.
Bad and bad.
Michael, this is exhilarating.
It won't be for long if we don't get out of here.
I'm going to try something.
I'd advise against it.
Why?
You don't even know what I'm going to do.
I rely on past performance to indicate future action.
Prepare for impact.
KITT, Turbo Boost.
Not on a turn, Michael.
(KITT SCREAMS)
It's no fun being predictable.
KITT, you scream like a girl.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING) It's five in the morning and all the square world are sleeping
We're going downtown, baby
Going to buy ourselves a little thrill
Yeah, we're driving through the ghetto
Where I sure feel out of place, man
Where's Julie?
Upstairs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa
KITT:
Michael, I have scanned the entering crowd.
So far, I've detected six knives, a slingshot, and two Chinese throwing stars.
This is worse than last night.
What the hell is going on?
KITT:
I am wondering the same thing.
Michael, the felons have returned.
Okay, you're good.
I'm going to open it up like a tin can.
That's it.
(YELLS)
Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
(GROANS)
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
No.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Billy?
Zoe?
You might want to see this.
Whoa.
I thought Mike told KITT to be Zen.
Sometimes, a man just reaches his limit.
It's not like KITT to disobey an order.
KITT?
What happened?
KITT:
I am wondering the same thing.
You mean that explosion wasn't you?
It wasn't me.
But I do detect high levels of methane gas that could have been ignited by the welding torch.
Going to the county registrar's files.
Pulling up the real estate records on Sonny's now.
Geological surveys, too?
They're not here.
Already tapped into Building and Safety.
There was a confidential subterranean survey done six months ago.
By who?
It was paid for by Driscoll Development.
Why?
Because it's not the bar.
It's what's under it.
The mineral rights.
Sonny's sits on top of a pool of methane.
Based on current prices and the estimated cubic footage, the rights are worth at least 50 million.
(WHISTLES)
KITT:
That would explain the explosion.
And the fires and the fights.
And why Driscoll wanted to buy the place.
Mike!
Yeah, Billy?
It's Phil Driscoll.
He's after the mineral rights.
ZOE:
They're worth at least 50 mil.
Michael.
Phil Driscoll set the fires to force you out.
He hired thugs to start trouble at Sonny's.
He wants your bar because the mineral rights are worth a fortune.
What are you talking about?
Phil was doing me a favor.
No.
You don't understand.
He had a geological survey done without your father's knowledge.
Michael, stop.
Phil had a heart attack this morning.
They found him less than an hour ago.
Phil Driscoll's dead.
Phil was an honest man.
He was my father's friend.
Then, why was he doing secret oil and gas surveys of your property?
What are you talking about?
KITT, on screen, in here.
How did you do that?
Push in on the last page.
Is there a signature?
KITT:
Yes.
Terrence Driscoll, Phil Driscoll's son.
Patch in Billy and Zoe.
We just got confirmation on Phil Driscoll's death.
Heart attack.
It's not Phil.
It's Terry.
It's always the crazy ones.
You've got to get me something solid enough to take him down.
I'm on it.
What the hell was that?
That is how I straighten out my karma.
I programmed image recognition for a 1968 Dodge Coronet.
Okay, we're hacked into every business with a camera system within a two mile radius of Sonny's.
Running footage the day of the accident now.
I need you to call Terry Driscoll and tell him you're so upset by his dad's death, you need to see him.
Tell him you can't handle the place by yourself and you're willing to sell.
He'll never go for it.
Trust me.
He'll go for it.
I don't even have his number.
KITT?
KITT:
It's ringing.
Terry.
It's Julie Nelson.
Listen, I need to see you.
This is a crazy long shot.
But we love long shots.
Right on schedule.
I'm really glad you called.
Can I get you something to drink?
Yeah, like a methane and soda?
(LAUGHING)
You know, I actually think it's harder playing dumb than being dumb.
No.
Don't sell yourself short, Terry.
You're really good at both.
Hold him!
JULIE:
Robin, the bat!
Hey!
(GRUNTING)
(CLAMORING)
(GROANING)
Get him out of here.
We've got a match.
It's from an ATM camera at a bank across the street.
While Julie's dad was inside the bank,
Terry Driscoll cut his brake line on his car.
That's right.
No skid marks.
(SNICKERS) Skid marks.
(GROANS)
So...
What happened after I blacked out?
Well, I had you brought up here, and then, I had my way with you.
Oh, good.
That wasn't a dream.
No.
Ow!
Oh!
I'm so sorry.
(LAUGHING)
Ow.
I was hoping you would stay a while.
You're keeping the bar open?
Mmm-hmm.
Come on.
You're sitting on, like, 50 mil worth of methane.
Well, somebody's got to keep Robin from sleeping with all the customers.
And look at Eddie.
He finally got his confidence back.
I made my dad a promise.
Hmm.
Sure you don't want to stick around?
It could be fun.
You could maybe tell me how you did all that stuff.
You know what they say.
You can't go home again.
Or at least, for the next, like, three to four hours, I could.
That's it?
That's it.
Stay Zen, dude.
You too, Eddie.
KITT:
I was wrong, Michael.
MIKE:
What are you talking about?
I guess you can go home again.
Oh,hold on.
I'm coming.
Increased productivity
Through ergonomically beneficial surroundings.
Well,in the spirit of ergonomy--
Is that even a word?
Ergonomy is the applied science
Of equipment design,michael.
Okay.
Well,then in the spirit of...origami,
You ever thinking about making your backseat
Into a bed,kitt?
I'm afraid you'd be tempted to invite strangers.
You mean "hoochies," kitt.
Undesirable females,yes.
This puppy has got a cooler
Built into the armrest
And a remote for the big screen.
That is sweet.
Chair belongs on the other side.
I like it where it is.
Move it,stretch.
The chinese system of feng shui
Would indicate that zoe's placement
Provides for better chi.
Very zen of you,kitt.
We could use a little more eastern philosophy around here.
See?
better chi.
Chop chop.
Who died and made you boss?
That would be alex torres.
hmm,I see you're already enjoying your downtime.
Oh,I have not yet begun to enjoy.
Going anywhere special?
Oh,yeah.
A little sentimental journey.
Wait,we get to go somewhere?
Outlet mall. spa day.
You guys are kidding,right?
I'm going to get mellow and be zen.
You mean "we," michael.
Yes,we. we are going,kitt.
Back to a special place.
A magical place.
Our own little happy place.
Michael is taking me to a bar.
Who'd have thunk it?
I want to go to a bar.
oh,no,not just any bar. sonny's.
Oh,I get it.
Your dad took me there for my first beer.
And his dad took him there for his.
It's a neighborhood institution.
A cold brew,beer nuts,live music.
Run by sonny nelson.
Amazing bartender,even better guy.
I haven't been there in years,
But I can tell you that there is no better place
To de-stress.
Sounds awesome.
I'm a veritable cornucopia of stress.
From what I remember,
Sonny had a daughter.
Yeah,julie nelson.
She went to med school I think
Somewhere back east.
Right. have a great time.
You too,guys.
Hello!
Hi.
We better tell him.
Or else he might have a breakdown.
Somebody please say something.
Look,we're going on rotation.
Everyone's gonna get a chance to decompress.
First,mike's gonna take a couple days.
And then you,and then zoe,and then me.
When's this all gonna start?
Ask your boss.
Okay,not funny.
No,billy,it was funny.
A little rougher than I remembered.
I must admit,I'm somewhat concerned
For you,michael.
I'll be okay,kitt. just stay close.
And be zen.
I will try.
If you're here about the bouncer job,
You're too pretty.
No,I'm actually here to see sonny.
Yeah,right.
If you're a collection agent,you can get in line.
Sorry?
Sonny's dead.
What?
Michael?
Oh,my god. michael,hi.
Hi.
Julie.
I didn't know you were friends.
Is it true about your dad?
Yeah,car accident three months ago.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
Michael,a nefarious character
Directly behind you is attempting to steal $20
From the bar.
What the hell is going on around here?
Wish I knew.
We've had three fires in the last six weeks.
Fights every night. cops have been closing us down.
What can I do to help?
Can you fix the mess at the door?
Sometimes eddie's a little bit too nice for his own good.
Big eddie's at the door?
Eddie's a pacifist.
I know.
Man.
Hey,the dude that left this unattended
Is gonna be taking public transportation
For a while.
Please step back from the vehicle.
Homeboy's got one of those talking alarms.
yeah,at least you'd think they'd give it
Some bad-ass voice like,
"step back,clown,before you get smoked."
You get smoked.
Michael,two felons are eyeing me suspiciously.
Permission to administer non-lethal electric shock.
What did I say about zen,kitt?
"restraint" is the word of the day.
All righet.Michael
Oh,my god,dude.
You just got schooled.
Michael,I suggest you use restraint as well.
Watch me.
It's $10 each,please.
I get comped at every club on the strip.
Why would I pay to go into this place?
This constant pushing is not helping your cause.
Nearly everyone at the door is armed.
All right,you're forcing my hand.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Would you hold on a moment,please?
Mike?
Hey,eddie.
What are you doing over here?
I've been wondering the same thing.
All right,any day now,dummy.
I didn't want to resort to violence,
But I feel as though I've reached my limit.
Mind a little assist?
Cause you're violating the cardinal rule at the door.
Really?
You never tell the bad guy what you're gonna do
Before you do it.
Screw this. we're going in.
He's got a gun in his waistband,michael.
Back up.
That was not smart.
Good night,gentlemen.
Go.
Anybody fighting inside walk them outside.
Take them one at a time.
Yell if you need any help.
Thanks,man.
Michael,I was harassed by two men.
Me too. get sarah.
How many you knock back so far?
Kitt,don't let him drive.
Sonny's dead.
Oh,no.
Car accident.
And the place isn't right-- mysterious fires,rough crowd.
A mess.
Sonny's never was in the best neighborhood.
Maybe you romanticized it a little?
I'm telling you,something's going on here,sarah.
I need your help.
Sure,anything.
Kitt,tap into the local municipal database.
Send the accident report,arson files,
And anything else you can dig up back to the ssc.
You guys getting this?
We're on it. yeah.
So what are you doing there?
I'm the new bouncer.
Bouncer?
Kick ass.
Be careful.
Let's get to work on those fires.
No,we should start on the car accident.
Begin a broad-spectrum search.
I'm sorry,what?
Sarah was only half joking.
She runs thze place because dr. graiman
Left her nine figures,
Mike and kitt do the outside stuff,
And I'm in charge of all this glory right here.
You?
you're my boss?
Haven't you noticed
I boss you around almost all day every day?
Yeah,but it's part of our whole fun little dynamic.
No,it's me being your boss.
I have multiple advanced degrees.
I speak nine languages
And I have a card that gets me discounts
At participating red lobster restaurants.
Okay,if this wasn't so ludicrous,
It would be ludicrous.
All right,I'm on the accident.
You look into the fires,
And we'll see who's right soon enough.
It's on.
Oh,it's all the way on.
All right,folks,you don't have to go home,
But you can't stay here.
Come on,let's go.
Come back tomorrow.
Let's go.
Didn't think you'd last the night.
Under-promise and over-deliver.
I'm Mike.
Robin.
Beer?
Nothing like a cold beer right after last call.
Michael helped my dad 86 some tough customers
Back in the day.
It was more him than me.
Sonny was a sweet guy,but he had one hot temper.
Well,thank god you showed up tonight.
I'm barely hanging on.
It was never like this before.
It's like somebody wants her outta here.
Any idea who that might be?
Maybe I'm not cut out for this like my dad.
I seriously doubt it's you.
Did you two have a thing?
Robin,come on.
Julie was a college girl,
On to bigger and better things.
She thought I was a punk.
You know,the kind of guy that hangs out in bars.
You didn't answer my question.
She calls you "Michael."
But you introduce yourself as mike.
Are either of you gonna cop to prior nookie or what?
Go on.
You think you might be able
To stick around a little while longer?
I'm sure I can squeeze it into my schedule.
Good.
Uh,staff meeting tomorrow morning, 11:00 a.m.
Good night,Julie.
Good night,Michael.
See you tomorrow,Mike.
Good night, Eddie
What?
Nothing.
You getting shut out?
Three fires in the last two months
Of unknown origin.
Police did an arson investigation
And came up empty.
But you have a theory?
Spontaneous combustion.
Or maybe it's the tiny chubby gnomes
Whose thighs rub together and make sparks
When they wear corduroy.
I suppose you're doing better with the car accident?
Patience,grasshopper.
Patience.
Anybody else bother you?
I was unmolested the remainder of the evening,
Michael.
Why do you have to use words like "unmolested"?
Can't you just say it was all okay?
I practiced the restraint you recommended,
But it wasn't easy.
Well,I'm proud of you,Kitt.
Michael,is it possible you are idealizing
Sonny's a bit?
Maybe you were remembering it the way you want it to be.
Come on,you too?
Thomas Wolfe wrote a novel about this phenomenon.
It was called you can't go home again.
Still think I'm idealizing?
Michael,someone appears to be trapped in the fire.
Open up. it's Eddie,help!
Open up. it's Eddie.
It's Eddie.
Somebody open up!
Where is he?
Michael,the pressurized co2 tanks
Have become dangerously overheated.
- We must act now.
- Do it.
Get in.
Kitt,co2.
The fire's out,michael.
Are you okay?
All of his vital signs are normal,Michael.
I'm gonna have to ask you not to mention
What you saw tonight to anyone.
Thank you.
That is the fourth fire in six weeks.
Doesn't sound much like an accident.
No,it sounds like arson.
Look,kitt can investigate
While you go to your meeting.
She's hot,by the way.
Who?
I believe she means julie,michael.
Hadn't noticed.
You're a terrible liar.
Three months ago today,
Julie's father takes his '68 dodge out for a spin
And ends up wrapping it around a telephone pole.
Anybody with him?
Nope. police report?
Same basic story.
Witnesses?
Cops say no.
But I found two blog entries from the neighborhood
From the next day.
Both say they saw the car
And heard nothing but a crash.
Okay,so it was an accident.
But you've got another theory.
Actually,I don't.
I've hit a dead end,literally and figuratively.
All right,let's get started.
First up,seems like we had another fire
Around closing last night.
Did anybody see anything?
No?
okay,um--
Hi,phil.
Hey. how's the nose?
It's broken.
I guess you didn't know who the hell you were assaulting.
My son's mouth tends to get
A step ahead of his brain.
Mike,isn't it?
phil driscoll.
Phil was an old friend of my dad's.
They were in a car club together.
My son comes home with a broken nose,
I'd never expect to hear it happened at sonny's.
Before I call the police or my lawyer,
I wanted to hear your side.
Sir,I make it a general policy
Not to raise hands to anyone
Unless they plan on throwing shots at me.
I shoulda broken your nose myself.
Are you kidding me,pop?
What is the old saying?
Outside of your wife giving birth,
Nothing good ever happens at 2:00 a.m.
Nice to meet you,mike. sorry for the inconvenience.
Not at all. thanks for coming by.
Creepy.
Come to mama.
Billy,zoe,I'm analyzing
The aftermath of the fire.
You certain it was arson?
Yes,and I have isolated the accelerant.
Whoever set the blaze left a chemically significant trail.
Can you follow it?
Not with my current software configuration.
Uploading new sniffer program now.
I'll do it.
duh,I'm already doing it.
Hello?
Hey.
Which one do you like better?
What's it for?
First amendment night.
Spoken word poetry and $2 jager shots.
"congress shall make no law respecting an establishment
"of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,
Or abridging the freedom of speech."
They teach you about the constitution in the army?
Thought I'd be good to actually know
What I was defending.
My dad called it the marinated microcosm.
Everybody's equal with a drink in their hand.
He was a hell of a guy.
Yeah.
Is that your grandfather?
Yeah.
Built this building with his own two hands.
He still scares me.
He was one mean son of a bitch.
And then some.
This bar was a soup kitchen in the great depression.
A polling place every election.
A shelter in three earthquakes.
My dad was even born here.
How come we never--
For starters,your dad kept
A really big bat behind the bar.
It's still there too.
Great.
I tried calling and emailing.
I even wrote you a letter.
Everything came back "undeliverable."
Yeah.
Let's just say I got involved in some things
That didn't turn out so well.
I was gonna be an ophthalmologist.
Now I run a bar.
Michael.
I've discovered a faint chemical signature
From the fire.
But we must follow its trail now
Before it dissipates completely.
I will see you tonight.
Sonny's used to be a friendly neighborhood bar,
Right?
All of a sudden,it starts to get rougher.
I thought you were working on the fires.
I was,but what if they're related?
What makes a crowd change?
New owner,neighborhood goes bad,
They water down the drinks.
Here's the greatest hits from the front door camera
At sonny's for the last three weeks.
Oh,he's cute.
He's also been in four fights.
So?
He's angry and he's cute.
So he just started showing up at the bar recently
Along with those four other dudes
Who've also been getting into fights.
And are also hot. it's called coincidence.
It would be except I followed them to the bar.
No 20s,no credit cards,
Hundred dollar bills every time.
Maybe they're drug dealers.
or maybe somebody's paying them to start trouble.
and how does this connect to the fires?
I don't know.
Hey,there's your 'stang,bro.
Still in the hood.
It's like he's teasing us.
I'd take that as a dare,I was you.
Yeah.
It's in the same family as methane,
But it's getting fainter as we go.
He must have gotten out of his car here.
You need to go handheld.
Kitt,you there?
Right behind you,Michael.
It just stops.
Whoever set the fire ended up here.
Phil Driscoll's office.
We traced him from the fire
Back to his father's office.
It's gotta be Terry.
He definitely had the opportunity.
And a broken nose is definitely motive.
I'd say the motive would be embarrassment.
You made him look weak in front of a beautiful woman.
Yeah,but Terry's a couple tacos short
Of a combination plate.
You don't think he's capable?
I think he's a moron.
Hit me back if Billy and Zoe come up with anything.
How's Julie Nelson?
Hanging in there.
Terry's a jerk,but he's not an arsonist.
I heard you went out with him.
A bar is like ninth grade summer school,isn't it?
Uh,yes,it was once,
And it was years ago.
So maybe he was trying to get your attention.
Nothing like a two-alarm blaze
To get a girl all hot and bothered.
- Robin's looking.
- Of course she is.
So what about Terry's father?
Why would Phil want to burn a place he offered to buy?
He offered to buy your bar?
After my dad was killed,
He figured I couldn't handle the bar by myself.
And maybe he was right.
You do sit on a valuable piece of dirt.
A place like this is a drop in the bucket
To a developer like Phil.
Believe me,he's doing it as a favor.
Sonny Nelson was driving a '68 dodge
The night of the accident.
Nice graphics.
- Nice grill.
- Thanks.
Where'd you get this?
I recreated his route from the blog descriptions
Then reenacted the accident
Using kitt's 3-d graphic software.
Nice work.
Wait,I thought we established
No foul play in the accident.
That's what the police said.
Not what I say.
He comes around this turn,
Hits the brakes,
Gets a little squirrelly,continues till he crashes.
Okay,so we see the accident.
But what don't we see?
Remember,the blogger said that he heard nothing
But a crash.
Skid marks.
Exactly.
He hit the brakes but the car didn't skid.
No screeching,no skidding.
Because you think he lost his brakes?
Or somebody cut the brake line.
It's not proof.
You said nice work.
It's a simulation.
It's not evidence. it won't hold up in court.
Which is why we need to find the real car.
Hey,Mike.
You really made me think about things.
Introspection is good,Eddie.
I've always thought of you as sort of a simple guy.
And by "simple" I mean straightforward,
But not very complicated.
No offense intended.
None taken.
I set the fire last night.
I thought if I set it and put it out,
I'd be a hero.
But then the back door locked on me.
I know,stupid,right?
And nobody put you up to it?
You saved my life.
Who are you really,Mike?
Just a guy trying to make things better.
It's a 1968 dodge coronet.
I've uploaded tags and vin number to Kitt.
You've gotta find that car.
Or what's left of it.
You know,I may have found a flaw in your logic,Kitt.
Really?
Your assumption was whoever set the fire
Ended up at Phil Driscoll's office.
Based on the spectrographic analysis,
That was correct.
But Eddie admitted he set it.
He could have gone to Driscoll's office
After he left us,or he could have been lying.
No,he was threatening to kick Terry Driscoll's ass.
So I'm guessing he wouldn't be heading
Over to their place for a nightcap.
My gut says he's telling the truth.
It is possible the methane trail
Could be related to another incident or person.
But outside of the fire,
There seems to be no logical reason.
Holograms.
Really?
That's right.
That was some seriously impressive Shizz back there.
I know.
That's usually my department.
I know.
Kinda made me look bad.
I know.
That's why I got you something.
What?
Level 14 knows how to party.
Botcraft 6.
Quest for cyclops.
Hammer of xerxes 7.
These aren't even out yet.
I know.
The dmv search was unsuccessful.
What about junkyards?
Insurance companies?
car collectors?
Maybe somebody bought it for parts.
I broadened my search parameters,
And they have come up with a possibility.
Great. where's the car?
The last place you ever would have expected.
An art gallery?
You're kidding.
The remains of Julie's father's car
Were purchased by an artist
And installed as the centerpiece
Of an exhibit here.
A man died in that car.
Apparently there is an artistic subculture
Especially fascinated by automobile crashes.
Outside their subculture,
They're known as idiots,Kitt.
Go ahead,touch it.
It helps you connect.
I call it "beautiful agony."
Wow. where'd you get it?
I scan the police blotter for fatal accidents,
And I buy the wrecks from the insurance company.
Yes.
Yes,I see.
I can tell that you're into it.
People come right up to the cars as if they--
It's as if they want to connect
With the moment of impact.
It's just so...visceral.
I'll let you remain in the moment then.
Listen to it.
It'll sing to you.
Enjoy.
Ass clown.
michael,thebrakesystemona '68dodge coronet
Has a fluid line running down the left side of the chassis.
Yeah,I'm getting there now.
The brake line's been cut.
It may have been severed in the crash.
No,this cut's too uniform.
Someone did this.
Zoe's right.
It was murder.
Who the hell is shooting at me?
The shots are coming from the bridge above.
what are you waiting for,a written invitation?
Come get me.
On my way,michael.
Cover me,scatter pattern.
Rapid fire will exhaust my ammunition supply
In approximately seven seconds.
Wow,seven seconds?
That's all you last?
That's 8,000 rounds,michael.
No,it's fine.
I'm sure sarah can fix it.
Start shooting.
Got the wheel?
how many?
Two in pursuit
And two attempting to block the roadway ahead,
And we are out of ammunition.
Okay,bad and bad.
Michael,this is exhilarating.
Won't be for long if we don't get outta here.
I'm gonna try something.
I'd advise against it.
Why?
you don't even know what I'm gonna do.
Irelyon pastperformancetoindicatefuture action .
Prepare for impact.
Kitt,turbo boost.
Not on a turn,michael.
Ooh!
Whoo,no fun being predictable.
Where's julie?
Upstairs.
Michael,I have scanned the entering crowd.
So far I've detected six knives,a slingshot,
And two Chinese throwing stars.
This is worse than last night.
What the hell is going on?
I am wondering the same thing.
Michael,the felons have returned.
Okay,you're good.
I'm gonna open it up like a tin can.
That's it.
Hey,hey,hey.
Come on.
Come on,let's get outta here.
Go,go,go.
Come on.
Billy,zoe,you might want to see this.
Whoa!
I thought mike told kitt to be zen.
Sometimes a man just reaches his limit.
It's not like kitt to disobey an order.
Kitt,what happened?
I am wondering the same thing.
You mean that explosion wasn't you?
It wasn't me.
But I do detect high levels of methane gas
That could have been ignited by the welding torch.
Going to county registrar's files,
Pulling up the real estate records on sonny's now.
Geological surveys too.
They're not here.
Already tapped into building and safety.
There was a confidential subterranean survey
Done six months ago.
By who?
It was paid for by driscoll development.
Why?
Because it's not the bar.
It's what's under it.
The mineral rights.
Sonny's sits on top of a pool of methane.
Based on current prices and the estimated cubic footage,
The rights are worth at least 50 million.
That would explain the explosion.
And the fires and the fights.
And why driscoll wanted to buy the place.
Mike.
Yeah,billy?
It's phil driscoll.
He's after the mineral rights.
They're worth at least 50 mil.
Michael.
Phil driscoll set the fires to force you out.
He hired thugs to start trouble at sonny's.
He wants your bar because the mineral rights
Are worth a fortune.
What are you talking about?
phil was doing me a favor.
no,youdon'tunderstand.
He had a geological survey done without your father's knowledge.
Michael,stop.
Phil had a heart attack this morning.
Found him less than an hour ago.
Phil driscoll's dead.
Phil was an honest man.
He was my father's friend.
Then why was he doing secret oil gas surveys Of your property?
What are you talking about?
Kitt,on screen in here.
How'd you do that?
pushinon thelastpage .
Is there a signature?
Yes,terrance driscoll,
Phil driscoll's son.
Patch in billy and zoe.
We just got confirmation on phil driscoll's death.
Heart attack.
It's not phil,it's terry.
Always the cute ones.
You gotta give me something solid enough to take him down.
I'm on it.
What the hell was that?
That is how I straighten out my karma.
Programmed image recognition
For a 1986 dodge coronet.
Okay,we're hacked into every business
With a camera system within a two-mile radius of sonny's.
Running footage the day of the accident now.
I need you to call terry driscoll
And tell him you're so upset by his dad's death
You need to see him.
Tell him you can't handle the place by yourself
And you're willing to sell.
He'll never go for it.
Trust me.
He'll go for it.
I don't even have his number.
Kitt.
It's ringing.
Terry. it's julie nelson.
Listen,I need to see you.
thisisacrazylong shot .
But we love long shots.
Right on schedule.
I'm,uh,I'm really glad you called.
Can I get you something to drink?
Yeah,like a methane and soda?
Oh.
You know,I actually think it's harder playing dumb
Than being dumb.
don'tseeyourselfshort,terry.
You're really good at both.
Hold him.
Catch.
Oh!
Get him outta here.
We got a match.
It's from an atm camera at a bank across the street.
While julie's dad was inside the bank,
Terry driscoll cut his brake line on his car.
That's right. no skid marks.
Skid marks.
Ow.
So what happened after I blacked out?
Well,I had you brought up here
And,um,then I had my way with you.
Okay,it wasn't a dream.
No.
I'm so sorry.
Oh.
I was hoping you would stay a while.
You're keeping the bar open?
Mm-hmm.
Come on,you're sitting
On,like,50 mil worth of methane.
Well,somebody's gotta keep robin
From sleeping with all the customers,
And look at eddie.
He finally got his confidence back.
I made my dad a promise.
Hmm.
Sure you don't want to stick around?
Could be fun.
You could maybe,um,tell me how you did
All that,um...
Stuff.
You know what they say.
You can't go home again.
Or at least for the next,like,three to four hours.
That's it?
Stay zen,dude.
You too,Eddie.
I was wrong,michael.
Really?
how so,kitt?
I guess you can go home again.
Oh, hold on.
I'm coming.
Increased productivity
Through ergonomically beneficial surroundings.
Well, in the spirit of ergonomy...
Is that even a word?
Ergonomy is the applied science
Of equipment design, Michael.
Okay.
Well, then in the spirit of... origami,
You ever thinking about making your backseat
Into a bed, Kitt?
I'm afraid you'd be tempted to invite strangers.
You mean "hoochies," Kitt.
Undesirable females, yes.
This puppy has got a cooler
Built into the armrest
And a remote for the big screen.
First and 17.
Ahh.
that is sweet.
chair belongs on the other side.
I like it where it is.
Move it, stretch.
The Chinese system of feng shui
Would indicate that Zoe's placement
Provides for better chi.
Very zen of you, Kitt.
We could use a little more eastern philosophy around here.
See?
Better chi.
Chop chop.
Who died and made you boss?
That would be Alex Torres.
Hmm, I see you're already enjoying your downtime.
Oh, I have not yet begun to enjoy.
Going anywhere special?
Oh, yeah.
A little sentimental journey.
Wait, we get to go somewhere?
- Outlet mall.
- SPA day.
You guys are kidding, right?
I'm going to get mellow and be zen.
You mean "we," Michael.
Yes, we.
We are going, Kitt.
Back to a special place.
A magical place.
Our own little happy place.
Michael is taking me to a bar.
Who'd have thunk it?
I want to go to a bar.
Oh, no, not just any bar.
Sonny's.
Oh, I get it.
Your dad took me there for my first beer.
And his dad took him there for his.
It's a neighbourhood institution.
A cold brew, beer nuts, live music.
Run by Sonny Nelson.
Amazing bartender, even better guy.
I haven't been there in years,
But I can tell you that there is no better place
To de-stress.
Sounds awesome.
I'm a veritable cornucopia of stress.
From what I remember,
Sonny had a daughter.
Yeah, Julie Nelson.
She went to med school I think
Somewhere back east.
Right.
Have a great time.
- You too, guys.
- Initiating launch pad.
Hello!
Hi.
We better tell him.
Or else he might have a breakdown.
Somebody please say something.
Look, we're going on rotation.
Everyone's gonna get a chance to decompress.
First, Mike's gonna take a couple days.
And then you, and then Zoe, and then me.
When's this all gonna start?
Ask your boss.
Okay, not funny.
No, Billy, it was funny.
A little rougher than I remembered.
I must admit, I'm somewhat concerned
For you, Michael.
I'll be okay, Kitt.
Just stay close.
And be zen.
I will try.
If you're here about the bouncer job,
You're too pretty.
No, I'm actually here to see Sonny.
Yeah, right.
If you're a collection agent, you can get in line.
Sorry?
Sonny's dead.
What?
Michael?
Oh, my god.
Michael, hi.
Hi.
Julie.
I didn't know you were friends.
Is it true about your dad?
Yeah, car accident three months ago.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
Michael, a nefarious character
Directly behind you is attempting to steal $20
From the bar.
What the hell is going on around here?
Wish I knew.
We've had three fires in the last six weeks.
Fights every night.
Cops have been closing us down.
What can I do to help?
Can you fix the mess at the door?
Sometimes Eddie's a little bit too nice for his own good.
Big Eddie's at the door?
Eddie's a pacifist.
I know.
ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Man.
Hey, the dude that left this unattended is gonna be taking public transportation for a while.
please step back from the vehicle.
oh, hey.
Homeboy's got one of those talking alarms.
Yeah, at least you'd think they'd give it
Some bad-ass voice like,
"step back, clown, before you get smoked."
You get smoked.
ho, ho, ho, ho.
Michael, Two felons are eyeing me suspiciously.
Permission to administer non-lethal electric shock.
What did I say about Zen, Kitt?
"Restraint" is the word of the day.
Alright, Michael oh, my God, dude.
You just got schooled.
Michael, I suggest you use restraint as well.
Watch me.
It's $10 each, please.
I get chomped at every club on the strip.
Why would I pay to go into this place?
This constant pushing is not helping your cause.
Nearly everyone at the door is armed.
All right, you're forcing my hand.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Would you hold on a moment, please?
Mike?
Hey, Eddie.
What are you doing over here?
I've been wondering the same thing.
All right, any day now, dummy.
I didn't want to resort to violence,
But I feel as though I've reached my limit.
Mind a little assist?
'Cause you're violating the cardinal rule at the door.
Really?
You never tell the bad guy what you're gonna do
Before you do it.
Screw this.
We're going in.
He's got a gun in his waistband, Michael.
Back up.
That was not smart.
Good night, gentlemen.
Go.
Anybody fighting inside walk them outside.
Take them one at a time.
Yell if you need any help.
Thanks, man.
Michael, I was harassed by two men.
Me too.
Get Sarah.
How many you knock back so far?
Kitt, don't let him drive.
Sonny's dead.
Oh, no.
Car accident.
And the place isn't right...
Mysterious fires, rough crowd.
A mess.
Sonny's never was in the best neighbourhood.
Maybe you romanticized it a little?
I'm telling you, something's going on here, Sarah.
I need your help.
Sure, anything.
Kitt, tap into the local municipal database.
Send the accident report, arson files,
And anything else you can dig up back to the SSC.
You guys getting this?
We're on it.
Yeah.
So what are you doing there?
I'm the new bouncer.
Bouncer?
Kick ass.
Be careful.
Let's get to work on those fires.
No, we should start on the car accident.
Begin a broad-spectrum search.
I'm sorry, what?
Sarah was only half joking.
She runs the place because Dr. Graiman
Left her nine figures,
Mike and Kitt do the outside stuff,
And I'm in charge of all this glory right here.
You?
You're my boss?
Haven't you noticed
I boss you around almost all day every day?
Yeah, but it's part of our whole fun little dynamic.
No, it's me being your boss.
I have multiple advanced degrees.
I speak nine languages
And I have a card that gets me discounts
At participating Red Lobster restaurants.
Okay, if this wasn't so ludicrous,
It would be ludicrous.
All right, I'm on the accident.
You look into the fires,
And we'll see who's right soon enough.
It's on.
Oh, it's all the way on.
All right, folks, you don't have to go home,
But you can't stay here.
Come on, let's go.
Come back tomorrow.
Let's go.
Didn't think you'd last the night.
Under-promise and over-deliver.
I'm Mike.
Robin.
Beer?
Nothing like a cold beer right after last call.
Michael helped my dad 86 some tough customers
Back in the day.
It was more him than me.
Sonny was a sweet guy, but he had one hot temper.
Well, thank God.
You showed up tonight.
I'm barely hanging on.
It was never like this before.
It's like somebody wants her outta here.
Any idea who that might be?
Maybe I'm not cut out for this like my dad.
I seriously doubt it's you.
Did you two have a thing?
Robin, come on.
Julie was a college girl,
On to bigger and better things.
She thought I was a punk.
You know, the kind of guy that hangs out in bars.
You didn't answer my question.
She calls you "Michael."
But you introduce yourself as Mike.
Are either of you gonna cop to prior nookie or what?
Go on.
You think you might be able
To stick around a little while longer?
I'm sure I can squeeze it into my schedule.
Good.
Uh, staff meeting tomorrow morning, 11:00 a.m.
Good night, Julie.
Good night, Michael.
- See you tomorrow, Mike.
- Good night, Eddie.
What?
Nothing.
You getting shut out?
Three fires in the last two months
Of unknown origin.
Police did an arson investigation and came up empty.
But you have a theory?
Spontaneous combustion.
Or maybe it's the tiny chubby gnomes whose thighs rub together and make sparks when they wear corduroy.
I suppose you're doing better with the car accident?
Patience, grasshopper.
Patience.
Anybody else bother you?
I was unmolested the remainder of the evening,
Why do you have to use words like "unmolested"?
Can't you just say it was all okay?
I practiced the restraint you recommended, ... but it wasn't easy.
Well, I'm proud of you, Kitt.
Michael, is it possible you are idealizing Sonny's a bit?
Maybe you were remembering it the way you want it to be.
Come on, you too?
Thomas Wolfe wrote a novel about this phenomenon.
It was called "You Can't Go Home Again".
Still think I'm idealizing?
Michael, someone appears to be trapped in the fire.
Open up.
It's Eddie, help!
Open up.
It's Eddie.
It's Eddie.
Somebody open up!
Where is he?
Michael, the pressurized CO2 tanks have become dangerously overheated.
We must act now.
Doing.
Get in.
Kitt, CO2.
The fire's out, Michael.
Are you okay?
All of his vital signs are normal, Michael.
I'm gonna have to ask you not to mention what you saw tonight to anyone.
Thank you.
That is the fourth fire in six weeks.
Doesn't sound much like an accident.
No, it sounds like arson.
Look, Kitt can investigate while you go to your meeting.
She's hot, by the way.
Who?
I believe she means Julie, Michael.
Hadn't noticed.
You're a terrible liar.
Three months ago today,
Julie's father takes his '68 Dodge out for a spin and ends up wrapping it around a telephone pole.
Anybody with him?
- Nope.
- Police report?
Same basic story.
Witnesses?
Cops say no.
But I found two blog entries from the neighbourhood from the next day.
Both say they saw the car and heard nothing but a crash.
Okay, so it was an accident.
But you've got another theory.
Actually, I don't.
I've hit a dead end, literally and figuratively.
All right, let's get started.
First up, seems like we had another fire around closing last night.
Did anybody see anything?
No?
Okay, um...
Hi, Phil.
Hey.
How's the nose?
It's broken.
I guess you didn't know who the hell you were assaulting.
Hey.
My son's mouth tends to get a step ahead of his brain.
- Mike, isn't it?
- Phil Driscoll.
Phil was an old friend of my dad's.
They were in a car club together.
My son comes home with a broken nose, ... I'd never expect to hear it happened at Sonny's.
Before I call the police or my lawyer, ... I wanted to hear your side.
Sir, I make it a general policy.
Not to raise hands to anyone unless they plan on throwing shots at me.
I should've broken your nose myself.
Are you kidding me, pop?
What is the old saying?
Outside of your wife giving birth, ... nothing good ever happens at 2:00 a.m.
Nice to meet you, Mike.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Not at all.
Thanks for coming by.
Creepy.
Ohh.
Come to mama.
Billy, Zoe, I'm analyzing the aftermath of the fire.
You certain it was arson?
Yes, and I have isolated the accelerant.
Whoever set the blaze left a chemically significant trail.
Can you follow it?
Not with my current software configuration.
Uploading new sniffer program now.
I'll do it.
Duh, I'm already doing it.
Hello?
Hey.
Which one do you like better?
What's it for?
First amendment night.
Spoken word poetry and $2 jager shots.
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment..."
"... of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,"
"... or abridging the freedom of speech."
They teach you about the constitution in the army?
Thought I'd be good to actually know what I was defending.
Hmm.
My dad called it the marinated microcosm.
Everybody's equal with a drink in their hand.
He was a hell of a guy.
Yeah.
Is that your grandfather?
Yeah.
Built this building with his own two hands.
He still scares me.
He was one mean son of a bitch.
And then some.
This bar was a soup kitchen in the great depression.
A polling place every election.
A shelter in three earthquakes.
My dad was even born here.
How come we never...
For starters, your dad kept a really big bat behind the bar.
It's still there too.
Great.
I tried calling and E-mailing.
I even wrote you a letter.
Everything came back "undeliverable".
Yeah.
Let's just say I got involved in some things...
That didn't turn out so well.
I was gonna be an ophthalmologist.
Now I run a bar.
Mike, I've discovered a faint chemical signature from the fire.
We must follow its trail now before it dissipates completely.
I will see you tonight.
Sonny's used to be a friendly neighbourhood bar,
Right?
Mm-hmm.
All of a sudden, it starts to get rougher.
I thought you were working on the fires.
I was, but what if they're related?
What makes a crowd change?
New owner, neighbourhood goes bad,
They water down the drinks.
Here's the greatest hits from the front door camera.
at Sonny's for the last three weeks.
Oh, he's cute.
He's also been in four fights.
So?
He's angry and he's cute.
So he just started showing up at the bar recently along with those four other dudes who've also been getting into fights.
And they are also hot.
It's called coincidence.
It would be except I followed them to the bar.
No 20s, no credit cards,
Hundred dollar bills every time.
Maybe they're drug dealers.
Or maybe somebody's paying them to start trouble.
And how does this connect to the fires?
I don't know.
Hey, there's your stang, bro.
Still in the hood.
It's like he's teasing us.
I'd take that as a dare, I was you.
Yeah.
It's in the same family as methane, but it's getting fainter as we go.
He must have gotten out of his car here.
You need to go handheld.
Kitt, you there?
Right behind you, Michael.
It just stops.
Whoever set the fire ended up here.
Phil Driscoll's office.
We traced him from the fire back to his father's office.
It's gotta be Terry.
He definitely had the opportunity.
And a broken nose is definitely motive.
I'd say the motive would be embarrassment.
You made him look weak in front of a beautiful woman.
Yeah, but Terry's a couple tacos short of a combination plate.
You don't think he's capable?
I think he's a moron.
Hit me back if Billy and Zoe come up with anything.
Hey,
How's Julie Nelson?
Hanging in there.
Terry's a jerk, but he's not an arsonist.
I heard you went out with him.
Wow.
A bar is like ninth grade summer school, isn't it?
Uh, yes, it was once,
And it was years ago.
So maybe he was trying to get your attention.
Nothing like a two-alarm blaze to get a girl all hot and bothered.
- Robin's looking.
- Of course she is.
So what about Terry's father?
Why would Phil want to burn a place he offered to buy?
He offered to buy your bar?
After my dad was killed,
He figured I couldn't handle the bar by myself.
And maybe he was right.
You do sit on a valuable piece of dirt.
A place like this is a drop in the bucket to a developer like Phil.
Believe me, he's doing it as a favour.
Sonny Nelson was driving a '68 Dodge the night of the accident.
Nice graphics.
- Nice grill.
- Thanks.
Where'd you get this?
I recreated his route from the blog descriptions, then re-enacted the accident
Using Kitt's 3-d graphic software.
Nice work.
Wait, I thought we established
No foul play in the accident.
That's what the police said.
Not what I say.
He comes around this turn,
Hits the brakes,
Gets a little squirrelly, continues till he crashes.
Okay, so we see the accident.
But what don't we see?
Remember, the blogger said that he heard nothing but a crash.
Skid marks.
Exactly.
He hit the brakes but the car didn't skid.
No screeching, no skidding.
Because you think he lost his brakes?
Or somebody cut the brake line.
It's not proof.
You said nice work.
It's a simulation.
It's not evidence.
It won't hold up in court.
Which is why we need to find the real car.
Hey, Mike.
You really made me think about things.
Introspection is good, Eddie.
I've always thought of you as sort of a simple guy.
And by "simple" I mean straightforward, but not very complicated.
No offence intended.
None taken.
I set the fire last night.
I thought if I set it and put it out,
I'd be a hero.
But then the back door locked on me.
I know, stupid, right?
And nobody put you up to it?
You saved my life.
Who are you really, Mike?
Just a guy trying to make things better.
It's a 1968 Dodge Coronet.
I've uploaded tags and vin number to Kitt.
You've gotta find that car.
Or what's left of it.
You know, I may have found a flaw in your logic, Kitt.
Really?
Your assumption was whoever set the fire ended up at Phil Driscoll's office.
Based on the spectrographic analysis, that was correct.
But Eddie admitted he set it.
He could have gone to Driscoll's office after he left us, or he could have been lying.
No, he was threatening to kick Terry Driscoll's ass.
So I'm guessing he wouldn't be heading over to their place for a nightcap.
My gut says he's telling the truth.
It is possible the methane trail could be related to another incident or person.
But outside of the fire, there seems to be no logical reason.
holograms.
Really?
that's right.
that was some seriously impressive shizz back there.
I know.
that's usually my department.
I know.
kinda made me look bad.
I know.
That's why I got you something.
what?
level 14 knows how to party.
botcraft 6.
Quest for cyclops.
Hammer of Xerxes 7.
These aren't even out yet.
I know.
the DMV search was unsuccessful.
what about junkyards?
Insurance companies?
Car collectors?
Maybe somebody bought it for parts.
I broadened my search parameters,
And they have come up with a possibility.
great.
Where's the car?
the last place you ever would have expected.
an art gallery?
You're kidding.
the remains of Julie's father's car
Were purchased by an artist
And installed as the centerpiece
Of an exhibit here.
a man died in that car.
apparently there is an artistic subculture
Especially fascinated by automobile crashes.
outside their subculture,
They're known as idiots, Kitt.
go ahead, touch it.
It helps you connect.
I call it "beautiful agony."
wow.
Where'd you get it?
I scan the police blotter for fatal accidents,
And I buy the wrecks from the insurance company.
yes.
Yes, I see.
I can tell that you're into it.
People come right up to the cars as if they...
It's as if they want to connect
With the moment of impact.
it's just so... visceral.
I'll let you remain in the moment then.
Listen to it.
It'll sing to you.
Enjoy.
ass clown.
Michael, the brake system on a '68 Dodge coronet
Has a fluid line running down the left side of the chassis.
yeah, I'm getting there now.
The brake line's been cut.
it may have been severed in the crash.
no, this cut's too uniform.
Someone did this.
Zoe's right.
It was murder.
who the hell is shooting at me?
the shots are coming from the bridge above.
what are you waiting for, a written invitation?
Come get me.
on my way, Michael.
cover me, scatter pattern.
rapid fire will exhaust my ammunition supply
In approximately seven seconds.
wow, seven seconds?
That's all you last?
that's 8,000 rounds, Michael.
no, it's fine.
I'm sure Sarah can fix it.
Start shooting.
Got the wheel?
How many?
two in pursuit
And two attempting to block the roadway ahead,
And we are out of ammunition.
okay, bad and bad.
Michael, his is exhilarating.
won't be for long if we don't get outta here.
I'm gonna try something.
I'd advise against it.
why?
You don't even know what I'm gonna do.
I rely on past performance to indicate future action.
Prepare for impact.
Kitt, turbo boost.
not on a turn, Michael.
ooh!
whoo, no fun being predictable.
Hey, you screamed like a girl.
where's Julie?
upstairs.
Michael, I have scanned the entering crowd.
So far I've detected six knives, a slingshot,
And two Chinese throwing stars.
this is worse than last night.
What the hell is going on?
I am wondering the same thing.
Michael, the felons have returned.
okay, you're good.
I'm gonna open it up like a tin can.
that's it.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Go, go, go.
Come on.
Billy, Zoe, you might want to see this.
whoa!
I thought Mike told Kitt to be zen.
sometimes a man just reaches his limit.
it's not like Kitt to disobey an order.
Kitt, what happened?
I am wondering the same thing.
you mean that explosion wasn't you?
it wasn't me.
But I do detect high levels of methane gas
That could have been ignited by the welding torch.
going to county registrar's files,
Pulling up the real estate records on Sonny's now.
geological surveys too.
they're not here.
already tapped into building and safety.
there was a confidential subterranean survey
Done six months ago.
by who?
it was paid for by Driscoll Development.
Why?
because it's not the bar.
It's what's under it.
the mineral rights.
Sonny's sits on top of a pool of methane.
Based on current prices and the estimated cubic footage,
The rights are worth at least 50 million.
that would explain the explosion.
and the fires and the fights.
and why Driscoll wanted to buy the place.
Mike.
yeah, Billy?
it's Phil Driscoll.
He's after the mineral rights.
they're worth at least 50 million.
Michael.
Phil Driscoll set the fires to force you out.
He hired thugs to start trouble at Sonny's.
He wants your bar because the mineral rights
Are worth a fortune.
What are you talking about?
Phil was doing me a favour.
No, you don't understand.
He had a geological survey done without your father's knowledge.
Michael, stop.
Phil had a heart attack this morning.
Found him less than an hour ago.
Phil Driscoll's dead.
Phil was an honest man.
He was my father's friend.
Then why was he doing secret oil gas surveys of your property?
What are you talking about?
Kitt, on screen in here.
How'd you do that?
Push in on the last page.
Is there a signature?
Yes, Terrance Driscoll,
Phil Driscoll's son.
Patch in Billy and Zoe.
We just got confirmation on Phil Driscoll's death.
Heart attack.
It's not Phil, it's Terry.
Always the crazy ones.
You gotta give me something solid enough to take him down.
I'm on it.
What the hell was that?
That is how I straighten out my karma.
Programmed image recognition for a 1986 Dodge Coronet.
Okay, we're hacked into every business
With a camera system within a two-mile radius of Sonny's.
Running footage the day of the accident now.
I need you to call Terry Driscoll
And tell him you're so upset by his dad's death
You need to see him.
Tell him you can't handle the place by yourself
And you're willing to sell.
He'll never go for it.
Trust me.
He'll go for it.
I don't even have his number.
Kitt.
It's ringing.
Terry.
It's Julie Nelson.
Listen, I need to see you.
This is a crazy long shot.
But we love long shots.
Right on schedule.
I'm, uh, I'm really glad you called.
Can I get you something to drink?
Yeah, like a methane and soda?
Oh.
You know, I actually think it's harder playing dumb than being dumb.
Don't see yourself short, Terry.
You're really good at both.
Hold him.
Robin, the bat!
Catch.
Oh!
Get him outta here.
We got a match.
It's from an ATM camera at a bank across the street.
While Julie's dad was inside the bank,
Terry Driscoll cut his brake line on his car.
That's right.
No skid marks.
Skid marks.
Ow.
So what happened after I blacked out?
Well, I had you brought up here
And, um, then I had my way with you.
Okay, it wasn't a dream.
No.
I'm so sorry.
Oh.
I was hoping you would stay a while.
You're keeping the bar open?
Mm-hmm.
Come on, you're sitting on, like, 50 million worth of methane.
Well, somebody's gotta keep Robin from sleeping with all the customers,
And look at Eddie.
He finally got his confidence back.
I made my dad a promise.
Hmm.
Sure you don't want to stick around?
Could be fun.
You could maybe, um, tell me how you did all that, um...
Stuff.
You know what they say.
You can't go home again.
Or at least for the next, like, three to four hours.
That's it?
I'm hurt.
Stay zen, dude.
You too, Eddie.
I was wrong, Michael.
What are you talking about?
I guess you can go home again.
Subtitle by Snitch Company®
Oh!
Hold on.
I'm coming.
All right.
Increased productivity through ergonomically beneficial surroundings.
Oh.
In the spirit of ergonomy.
Is that even a word?
Ergonomy is the applied science of equipment design, Michael.
Okay.
Well, then, in the spirit of origami, you ever think about making your backseat into a bed, KITT?
I'm afraid you'd be tempted to invite strangers.
You mean, hoochies, KITT.
Undesirable females, yes.
This puppy has got a cooler built into the armrest.
And a remote for the big screen.
Ah.
That is sweet.
Chair belongs on the other side.
I like it where it is.
Move it, stretch.
The Chinese system of Feng Shui would indicate that
Zoe's placement provides for better chi.
Very Zen of you, KITT.
We could use a little more eastern philosophy around here.
See?
Better chi.
Chop, chop.
Who died and made you boss?
That would be Alex Torres.
I see you're already enjoying your downtime.
Oh, I have not yet begun to enjoy.
Going anywhere special?
Oh, yeah.
Little sentimental journey.
Wait.
We get to go somewhere?
Outlet mall.
Spa day.
You guys are kidding, right?
I am going to be mellow and get Zen.
You mean "we," Michael.
Yes, "we." We are going, KITT.
Back to a special place.
Magical place.
Our own little happy place.
Michael is taking me to a bar.
Who would have thunk it?
I want to go to a bar!
Oh, no.
Not just any bar.
Sonny's.
Oh, I get it.
Your dad took me there for my first beer.
And his dad took him there for his.
It's a neighborhood institution.
Cold brew, beer nuts, live music.
Run by Sonny Nelson.
Amazing bartender.
Even better guy.
I haven't been there in years, but I can tell you that there is no better place to de-stress.
Sounds awesome.
I'm a veritable cornucopia of stress.
From what I remember, Sonny had a daughter.
Oh, yeah.
Julie Nelson.
She went to med school, I think.
Somewhere back east.
Right.
Have a great time.
You too, guys.
Initiating launch prep.
Hello?
Hey.
We'd better tell him.
Or else he might have a breakdown.
Somebody, please!
Say something.
Look, we're going on rotation.
Everyone's going to get a chance to decompress.
First, Mike's going to take a couple of days, and then you and then Zoe and then me.
When's this all going to start?
Ask your boss.
Okay, not funny.
No, Billy.
Funny.
Little rougher than I remembered.
I must admit, I'm somewhat concerned for you, Michael.
I'll be okay, KITT.
Just stay close.
And be Zen.
I will try.
You'rejustaman
Wait, because I'm inside out now
Crazy, you know I'm not outside, around
Try, you can find my body of questions on your own
Falling intentions
Brings me from my misery
Just as I stand up
If you're here about the bouncer job, you're too pretty.
No.
I'm actually here to see Sonny.
Yeah, right.
If you're a collection agent, you can get in line.
I'm sorry?
Sonny's dead.
What?
Michael?
Oh, my God.
Michael.
Hey.
Julie!
I didn't know you were friends.
Is it true?
About your dad?
Yeah.
Car accident.
Three months ago.
I am so sorry.
Thank you.
Michael, a nefarious character directly behind you is attempting to steal $20 from the bar.
What the hell is going on around here?
I wish I knew.
We've had three fires in the last six weeks.
Fights, every night.
The cops have been closing us down.
What can I do to help?
Can you fix the mess at the door?
Sometimes, Eddie's a little bit too nice for his own good.
- Big Eddie's at the door?
- Mmm-hmm.
Eddie's a pacifist.
I know.
Man!
Hey.
The dude who left this unattended is going to be taking public transportation for a while.
Please step back from the vehicle.
Hey.
Homeboy has got one of those talking alarms.
Yeah.
At least you'd think they'd give it some badass voice, like, "Step back, clown, before you get smoked!"
Michael, two felons are eyeing me suspiciously.
Permission to administer non-lethal electric shock.
What did I say about Zen, KITT?
Restraint is the word of the day.
All right, Michael.
Oh, my God, dude.
You just got schooled!
Michael, may I suggest you use restraint, as well?
Watch me.
That's $10 each, please.
Well, I get comped at every club on the strip.
Why would I pay to go into this place?
Hey.
This constant pushing is not helping your cause.
Ooh.
Nearly everyone at the door is armed.
All right.
You're forcing my hand.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Could you hold on one moment, please?
Mike?
Hey, Eddie.
What are you doing over here?
I've been wondering the same thing.
All right.
Any day now, dummy.
I didn't want to resort to violence, but I feel as though I've reached my limit.
You mind a little assist?
Because...
Ooh.
You're violating the cardinal rule of the door.
You never tell the bad guy what you're going to do before you do it.
Screw this.
We're going in.
He's got a gun in his waistband, Michael.
Back up!
That was not smart.
Good night, gentlemen.
Let's go.
Anybody fighting inside, walk them outside.
Take them one at a time.
Yell if you need any help.
Thanks, Mike.
Michael, I was harassed by two men.
Me, too.
Get Sarah.
How many you knock back so far?
KITT, don't let him drive.
Sonny's dead.
Oh, no.
A car accident.
And the place isn't right.
Mysterious fires, rough crowd.
A mess.
Sonny's never was in the best neighborhood.
Maybe you romanticized it a little.
I'm telling you something's going on here, Sarah.
I need your help.
Sure.
Anything.
KITT, tap into the local municipal database.
Send the accident report, arson files, and anything else you can dig up back to the SSC.
You guys getting this?
Yeah, yeah.
We're on it.
So, what are you doing there?
I'm the new bouncer.
Bouncer?
Kick ass.
Be careful.
Let's get to work on those fires.
No, we should start on the car accident.
Begin a broad-spectrum search.
I'm sorry, what?
Sarah was only half joking.
She runs the place because Dr. Graiman left her nine figures.
Mike and KITT do the outside stuff, and I'm in charge of all this glory right here.
You?
You're my boss?
Haven't you noticed I boss you around almost all day, every day?
Yeah, but it's part of our whole fun little dynamic.
No, it's me being your boss.
I have multiple advanced degrees.
I speak nine languages and I have a card that gets me discounts at participating Red Lobster restaurants.
Okay.
If this wasn't so ludicrous, it would be ludicrous.
All right.
I'm on the accident, you look into the fires, and we'll see who's right soon enough.
It's on.
It's all the way on.
All right, folks.
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
Come on.
Let's go.
Come back tomorrow.
Let's go.
Didn't think you'd last the night.
Under-promise and over-deliver.
I'm Mike.
Robin.
Beer?
Nothing like a cold beer right after last call.
Michael helped my dad 86 some tough customers back in the day.
Yeah, it was more him than me.
Sonny was a sweet guy, but he had one hot temper.
Well, thank God you showed up tonight.
I'm barely hanging on.
It was never like this before.
It's like somebody wants her out of here.
Any idea who that might be?
Maybe I'm not cut out for this like my dad.
I seriously doubt it's you.
Did you two have a thing?
Robin, come on.
Julie was a college girl.
On to bigger and better things.
She thought I was a punk.
You know, the kind of guy that hangs out in bars.
You didn't answer my question.
She calls you Michael, but you introduced yourself as Mike.
Are either of you going to cop to prior nookie, or what?
Go on.
You think you might be able to stick around a little while longer?
I'm sure I can squeeze it into my schedule.
Good.
Staff meeting.
Tomorrow morning. 11:00 a.m.
Good night, Julie.
Good night, Michael.
See you tomorrow, Mike.
Night, Eddie.
What?
Nothing.
You getting shut out?
Three fires in the last two months of unknown origin.
Police did an arson investigation and came up empty.
But you have a theory.
Spontaneous combustion.
Or maybe it's the tiny, chubby gnomes whose thighs rub together and make sparks when they wear corduroy?
I suppose you're doing better with the car accident.
Patience, grasshopper.
Patience.
Anybody else bother you?
I was unmolested the remainder of the evening.
Why do you have to use words like "unmolested"?
Can't you just say, "It was all okay"?
I managed to practice the restraint you recommended, but it wasn't easy.
Well, I'm proud of you, KITT.
Michael, is it possible you are idealizing Sonny's a bit?
Maybe you are remembering it the way you want it to be.
Come on.
You, too?
Thomas Wolfe wrote a novel about this phenomenon.
It was called You Can't Go Home Again.
Still think I'm idealizing?
Michael, someone is trapped in the fire.
Open up!
It's Eddie!
Get me out of here!
There's a fire!
Help!
Oh, no!
Help!
Come on, man!
Please!
Open up!
Somebody open up!
Where is he?
Michael, the pressurized CO 2 tanks have become dangerously overheated.
You must act now.
Do it.
Get in!
KITT, CO2.
The fire's out, Michael.
You okay?
All of his vital signs are normal, Michael.
I'm going to have to ask you not to mention what you saw tonight to anyone.
Thank you.
That is the fourth fire in six weeks.
Doesn't sound much like an accident.
No.
It sounds like arson.
Look.
KITT can investigate while you go to your meeting.
She's hot, by the way.
Who?
I believe she means Julie, Michael.
I hadn't noticed.
You're a terrible liar.
Three months ago today, Julie's father takes his '68 Dodge out for a spin and ends up wrapping it around a telephone pole.
Anybody with him?
Nope.
Police report?
Same basic story.
Witnesses?
Cops say no.
But I found two blog entries from the neighborhood from the next day.
Both say they saw the car and heard nothing but a crash.
Okay, so it was an accident.
But you've got another theory.
Actually, I don't.
I've hit a dead end, literally and figuratively.
All right.
Let's get started.
First up, seems like we had another fire around closing last night.
Did anybody see anything?
Mmm-mmm.
No?
Okay.
Hi, Phil.
Hey.
How's the nose?
It's broken.
I guess you didn't know who the hell you were assaulting.
Hey.
My son's mouth tends to get a step ahead of his brain.
Mike, isn't it?
Phil Driscoll.
Phil was an old friend of my dad's.
They were in a car club together.
My son comes home with a broken nose,
I'd never expect to hear it happened at Sonny's.
Before I called the police or my lawyer, I wanted to hear your side.
Sir, I make it a general policy not to raise hands to anyone, unless they plan on throwing shots at me.
I should have broken your nose myself.
Are you kidding me, Pop?
What's the old saying?
"Outside of your wife giving birth,
"nothing good ever happens at 2:00 a.m."
Nice to meet you, Mike.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Not at all.
Thanks for coming by.
Creepy.
Come to Mama.
Billy?
Zoe?
I'm analyzing the aftermath of the fire.
You certain it was arson?
Yes.
I have isolated the accelerant.
Whoever set the blaze left a chemically significant trail.
Can you follow it?
Not with my current software configuration.
Uploading new sniffer program now.
I'll do it.
Duh.
I'm already doing it.
Hello?
Hey.
Which one do you like better?
What's it for?
First amendment night.
Spoken word poetry and $2 Jager shots.
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech.
They teach you about the constitution in the army?
I thought it would be good to actually know what I was defending.
My dad called it the marinated microcosm.
Everybody's equal with a drink in their hand.
He was a hell of a guy.
Yeah.
Is that your grandfather?
Yep.
Built this building with his own two hands.
He still scares me.
Bet he was one mean son of a bitch.
And then, some.
This bar was a soup kitchen in the Great Depression, a polling place every election, a shelter in three earthquakes...
My dad was even born here.
How come we never...
For starters, your dad kept a really big bat behind the bar.
It's still there, too.
Great.
I tried calling and emailing.
I even wrote you a letter.
Everything came back undeliverable.
Yeah.
Let's just say I got involved in some things that didn't turn out so well.
I was going to be an ophthalmologist.
Now, I run a bar.
Michael, I've discovered a faint chemical signature from the fire.
But we must follow its trail now before it dissipates completely.
I will see you tonight.
Sonny's used to be a friendly neighborhood bar, right?
Mmm-hmm.
All of a sudden, it starts to get rougher.
I thought you were working on the fires.
I was.
But what if they're related?
What makes a crowd change?
New owner.
Neighborhood goes bad.
They water down the drinks.
Here's the greatest hits from the front door camera at Sonny's for the last three weeks.
Oh, he's cute.
He's also been in four fights.
So?
He's angry and he's cute.
So, he just started showing up at the bar recently, along with those four other dudes, who've also been getting into fights.
And they're also hot.
It's called coincidence.
It would be.
Except I followed them to the bar.
No twenties.
No credit cards.
Hundred dollar bills every time.
Maybe they're drug dealers.
Or maybe somebody's paying them to start trouble.
And how does this connect to the fires?
I don't know.
Hey.
There's your 'Stang, bro.
Still in the hood.
It's like he's teasing us.
I'd take that as a dare, I was you.
Yeah.
It's in the same family as methane, but it's getting fainter as we go.
He must have gotten out of his car here.
You need to go hand-held.
KITT, you there?
Right behind you, Michael.
It just stops.
Whoever set that fire ended up here.
Phil Driscoll's office.
We traced him from the fire back to his father's office.
It's got to be Terry.
He definitely had the opportunity.
Yeah, and a broken nose is definitely motive.
I'd say the motive would be embarrassment.
You made him look weak in front of a beautiful woman.
Yeah, but Terry's a couple tacos short of a combination plate.
You don't think he's capable?
I think he's a moron.
Hit me back if Billy and Zoe come up with anything.
Hey.
How's Julie Nelson?
Hanging in there.
Come,lookaround, sit down with us
Terry's a jerk, but he's not an arsonist.
I heard you went out with him.
Wow.
A bar is like ninth grade summer school, isn't it?
Yes.
It was once, and it was years ago.
So, maybe he was trying to get your attention.
Nothing like a two-alarm blaze to get a girl all hot and bothered.
Robin's looking.
Of course, she is.
So, what about Terry's father?
Why would Phil want to burn a place he offered to buy?
He offered to buy your bar?
After my dad was killed, he figured I couldn't handle the bar by myself.
And maybe he was right.
You do sit on a valuable piece of dirt.
A place like this is a drop in the bucket to a developer like Phil.
Believe me, he's doing it as a favor.
Sonny Nelson was driving his '68 Dodge the night of the accident.
Nice graphics.
Nice grill.
Thanks.
Where did you get this?
I recreated his route from the blog descriptions, then re-enacted the accident using KITT's 3D graphics software.
Nice work.
Wait.
I thought we established no foul play in the accident.
That's what the police said.
Not what I say.
He comes around this turn, hits the brakes, gets a little squirrelly, continues until he crashes.
At least we can see the accident.
But what don't we see?
Remember?
The bloggers said they heard nothing but a crash.
Skid marks.
Exactly.
He hit the brakes, but the car didn't skid.
No screeching, no skidding.
Because you think he lost his brakes?
Or somebody cut the brake line.
It's not proof.
You said, "Nice work."
It's a simulation.
It's not evidence.
It won't hold up in court.
Which is why we need to find the real car.
Hey, Mike.
You really made me think about things.
Introspection is good, Eddie.
I've always thought of you as sort of a simple guy.
And by simple, I mean straightforward, but not very complicated.
No offense intended.
None taken.
I set the fire last night.
I thought if I set it, and put it out, I'd be a hero.
But then, the back door locked on me.
I know.
Stupid, right?
And nobody put you up to it?
You saved my life.
Who are you really, Mike?
Just a guy trying to make things better.
1968 Dodge Coronet.
I've uploaded tags and VIN number to KITT.
You've got to find that car.
Or what's left of it.
You know, I may have found a flaw in your logic, KITT.
Really?
Your assumption was whoever set the fire ended up at Phil Driscoll's office.
Based on the spectrographic analysis, that was correct.
But Eddie admitted he set it.
He could have gone to Driscoll's office after he left us, or he could have been lying.
No.
He was threatening to kick Terry Driscoll's ass, so I'm guessing he wouldn't be heading over to their place for a nightcap.
My gut says he was telling the truth.
It is possible the methane trail could be related to another incident or a person.
But outside of the fire, there seems to be no logical reason.
Holograms?
Really?
That's right.
That was some seriously impressive shizz back there.
I know.
That's usually my department.
I know.
You kind of made me look bad.
I know.
That's why I got you something.
What?
Level Fourteen knows how to party.
"Botcraft Six.
Quest for Cyclops.
Hammer of Xerxes Seven."
These aren't even out, yet.
I know.
The DMVsearch was unsuccessful.
What about junk yards?
Insurance companies?
Car collectors?
Maybe somebody bought it for parts.
I have broadened my research parameters, and may have come up with a possibility.
Great.
Where's the car?
The last place you ever would have expected.
An art gallery?
You're kidding.
The remains of Julie's father's car were purchased by an artist and installed as the centerpiece of an exhibit here.
A man died in that car.
Apparently, there is an artistic subculture especially fascinated by automobile crashes.
Outside their subculture, they're known as idiots, KITT.
Go ahead.
Touch it.
It helps you connect.
I call it Beautiful Agony.
Wow.
Where did you get it?
I scan the police blotter for fatal accidents.
Then, I buy the wrecks from the insurance company.
Yes.
Yes, I see.
I can tell that you're into it.
People who come right up to the car, it's as if they...
It's as if they want to connect to the moment of impact.
Well, it's just so, you know, visceral.
I'll let you remain in the moment, then.
Listen to it.
It will sing to you.
Enjoy.
Ass clown.
Michael, the brake system on a '68 Dodge Coronet has a fluid line running down the left side of the chassis.
I'm getting there now.
The brake lines have been cut.
It may have been severed in the crash.
No, this cut's too uniform.
Someone did this.
Zoe's right.
It was murder.
Who the hell is shooting at me?
The shots are coming from the bridge above.
What are you waiting for?
A written invitation?
Come get me.
On my way, Michael.
Cover me.
Scatter pattern.
Rapid fire will exhaust my ammunition supply in approximately seven seconds.
Wow.
Seven seconds?
That's all you last?
That's 8,000 rounds, Michael.
Oh, it's fine.
I'm sure Sarah can fix it.
Start shooting.
Got the wheel.
How many?
Two in pursuit.
And two attempting to block the roadway ahead.
And we are out of ammunition.
Okay.
Bad and bad.
Michael, this is exhilarating.
It won't be for long if we don't get out of here.
I'm going to try something.
I'd advise against it.
Why?
You don't even know what I'm going to do.
I rely on past performance to indicate future action.
Prepare for impact.
KITT, Turbo Boost.
Not on a turn, Michael.
It's no fun being predictable.
KITT, you scream like a girl.
It'sfivein themorning and all the square world are sleeping
We're going downtown, baby
Going to buy ourselves a little thrill
Yeah, we're driving through the ghetto
Where I sure feel out of place, man
Where's Julie?
Upstairs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa
Michael, I have scanned the entering crowd.
So far, I've detected six knives, a slingshot, and two Chinese throwing stars.
This is worse than last night.
What the hell is going on?
I am wondering the same thing.
Michael, the felons have returned.
Okay, you're good.
I'm going to open it up like a tin can.
That's it.
Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
No.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Billy?
Zoe?
You might want to see this.
Whoa.
I thought Mike told KITT to be Zen.
Sometimes, a man just reaches his limit.
It's not like KITT to disobey an order.
KITT?
What happened?
I am wondering the same thing.
You mean that explosion wasn't you?
It wasn't me.
But I do detect high levels of methane gas that could have been ignited by the welding torch.
Going to the county registrar's files.
Pulling up the real estate records on Sonny's now.
Geological surveys, too?
They're not here.
Already tapped into Building and Safety.
There was a confidential subterranean survey done six months ago.
By who?
It was paid for by Driscoll Development.
Why?
Because it's not the bar.
It's what's under it.
The mineral rights.
Sonny's sits on top of a pool of methane.
Based on current prices and the estimated cubic footage, the rights are worth at least 50 million.
That would explain the explosion.
And the fires and the fights.
And why Driscoll wanted to buy the place.
Mike!
Yeah, Billy?
It's Phil Driscoll.
He's after the mineral rights.
They're worth at least 50 mil.
Michael.
Phil Driscoll set the fires to force you out.
He hired thugs to start trouble at Sonny's.
He wants your bar because the mineral rights are worth a fortune.
What are you talking about?
Phil was doing me a favor.
No.
You don't understand.
He had a geological survey done without your father's knowledge.
Michael, stop.
Phil had a heart attack this morning.
They found him less than an hour ago.
Phil Driscoll's dead.
Phil was an honest man.
He was my father's friend.
Then, why was he doing secret oil and gas surveys of your property?
What are you talking about?
KITT, on screen, in here.
How did you do that?
Push in on the last page.
Is there a signature?
Yes.
Terrence Driscoll, Phil Driscoll's son.
Patch in Billy and Zoe.
We just got confirmation on Phil Driscoll's death.
Heart attack.
It's not Phil.
It's Terry.
It's always the crazy ones.
You've got to get me something solid enough to take him down.
I'm on it.
What the hell was that?
That is how I straighten out my karma.
I programmed image recognition for a 1968 Dodge Coronet.
Okay, we're hacked into every business with a camera system within a two mile radius of Sonny's.
Running footage the day of the accident now.
I need you to call Terry Driscoll and tell him you're so upset by his dad's death, you need to see him.
Tell him you can't handle the place by yourself and you're willing to sell.
He'll never go for it.
Trust me.
He'll go for it.
I don't even have his number.
- KITT?
- It's ringing.
Terry.
It's Julie Nelson.
Listen, I need to see you.
This is a crazy long shot.
But we love long shots.
Right on schedule.
I'm really glad you called.
Can I get you something to drink?
Yeah, like a methane and soda?
You know, I actually think it's harder playing dumb than being dumb.
No.
Don't sell yourself short, Terry.
You're really good at both.
Hold him!
Robin, the bat!
Hey!
Get him out of here.
We've got a match.
It's from an ATM camera at a bank across the street.
While Julie's dad was inside the bank,
Terry Driscoll cut his brake line on his car.
That's right.
No skid marks.
Skid marks.
So...
What happened after I blacked out?
Well, I had you brought up here, and then, I had my way with you.
Oh, good.
That wasn't a dream.
No.
Ow!
Oh!
I'm so sorry.
Ow.
I was hoping you would stay a while.
- You're keeping the bar open?
- Mmm-hmm.
Come on.
You're sitting on, like, 50 mil worth of methane.
Well, somebody's got to keep Robin from sleeping with all the customers.
And look at Eddie.
He finally got his confidence back.
I made my dad a promise.
Hmm.
Sure you don't want to stick around?
It could be fun.
You could maybe tell me how you did all that stuff.
You know what they say.
You can't go home again.
Or at least, for the next, like, three to four hours, I could.
That's it?
That's it.
Stay Zen, dude.
You too, Eddie.
I was wrong, Michael.
What are you talking about?
I guess you can go home again.
(accordion music playing)
What do you think, kids?
Isn't it beautiful?
where do you think the clinic is?
That's where two be.
Who are you people?
Newcomers.
So, where have you come from?
We just got off the bus.
But where did you get on the bus?
Well, the village.
No, this is the village-- you've arrived here.
Well, isn't that just the wildest thing?
Ah, sir, your car is waiting.
mr. curtis is expecting you in 44 minutes.
Your car is right outside.
In 43 minutes.
They're building houses, busing people in--
That has to mean something.
(313) yeah, more village.
Be still, please.
what is this anyway?
Your name came up on the test list.
The village is all that there is and now, there are newcomers.
How can they say that's possible?
You're right.
I say as though it was something ordinary.
We all say, "more village."
(groaning softly) (nervously) oh, uh...
What is it?
(muffled applause)
(two) aren't they splendid?
Isn't this just the most wonderful thing?
They're buildings, houses.
Eleven-twelve, you could not be more profoundly wrong.
More village, means that our way of life
Is becoming the very consciousness of the universe.
I exaggerate, of course, but only slightly.
Oh, indulge me.
Take it all in.
(inhaling)
This moment will be handed down
Through generations of our family.
(chuckling)
There will be generations of our family,
Won't there, 11-12?
Yes.
i suppose.
(laughing)
Oh, dear, oh, dear, 11-12 you're so...
Earnest.
Take a tip from your old man--
Unbutton yourself, enjoy life.
Dance the night away with some darling girl.
(laughing)
(six) what is this?
Is it perhaps your certificate of dying?
Why now?
You coulda killed me a thousand times.
I've tried every way i know to help you to belong,
But still, you refuse.
You choose this life or no life.
Assimilate or die?
(two) that is the great gift of village death.
Clarity of choice.
Oh two, it's you.
Two in person.
I-i would ask for your autograph
But i don't have a pen.
(giggling)
There are people here, six.
Good people.
Newcomers.
Look at them.
Hi!
They choose life.
But you--
I'll find a way out before i die.
(coughing)
Oh, six.
Let me give the very secret of life.
Breath in... (coughing)
Breath out.
More... village.
I say, once you die, one breath at a time, six.
One...
Tick of the clock at a time.
Tk, tk.
Tk, tk.
Tk, tk.
(woman) i said, "don't look at me."
(two) pity about poor ol' six.
how does that make you feel, 313?
be honest.
If you can't confide in two, who can you confide in?
I wish you'd--
Would help him.
There's something inside six that refuses to be unlocked.
And perhaps the prospect of death will unlock him.
death unlocks us all.
and still, he clings to his abstinence.
Freedom.
Such touching faiths-- one envies him, almost.
but you and i know better.
(woman, crying) i'm sorry.
We have measured the cost, wouldn't you say?
(woman) don't look.
or am i right at the mark?
(whispering) no.
Don't let her rule you.
(woman) shut up...
Block her out of you.
lock her out.
it's hard.
(woman) put it on your head.
The things she showed me.
the other-- the other place?
It's in my head now, though.
I can't just rub it out.
Can't or won't?
(woman) shut up!
shut up!
self-control is all that is required...
For six's sake.
Still come here?
What do you want from me, six?
To kill someone you love because you love them.
the village does that to you.
Don't you have to wonder what kinda place it is?
(chuckling)
(coughing)
I know you don't want to yet...
The time is coming...
When you wanna tell me...
To give me the information
To get us all outta here...
To get you outta here.
(coughing)
Does your mother care for you, six?
Mine does.
I believe she does.
Only a mother can destroy every ounce of hope in ya.
(chuckling)
(horns honking)
(coughing)
(bells tolling)
(clocks ticking quickly)
So, what are you gonna do?
You just gonna let them do this you?
Listen to me.
I met someone who might be able to help you.
Now this guy-- this guy is deep.
This guy's got cures.
Hey!
One-four-seven.
I make it, ah, 10 till, which gives us 24 minutes
To get across to mr. curtis and we don't wanna be late.
People usually like to be early for mr. curtis.
(horns blaring)
Hey, you like to ride?
hmm.
'cause i like to ride.
Man, time was, i was so crazy i thought every single car
On the street was out to get me
And i just had to get 'em first.
And i just wanted to hurt somebody.
and now?
now?
Now, i'm a baby.
Now i'm seeing the world through fresh eyes.
It's like my brain has had a wash.
Like, ah, a spring clean of the frontal lobe.
You know what i mean?
(speaking foreign language)
What is this?
Something's coming.
Do you feel it?
And all we have to do is wait.
(six) no, can't you see that's crazy?
Waiting is giving up.
They keep us here to control our minds up there.
You were there now driving a car, right now, driving me.
Man!
I mean, look at this-- it's my little girl.
i mean, this is an old one but, uh, ain't she something?
huh?
And mr. curtis has had a word with the judge and he says if i keep making progress,
They gonna let me see her again.
Mr. curtis ain't nothing but a kind man.
he's a great man.
No, that's the most insanest thing i've ever heard.
We gotta get ourselves outta here-- come on!
Right now, you're dying
And everyone knows dead men don't have no hope.
What does this great man want with me?
(laughing)
I'm just a driver, man.
I don't know his plans.
but i will tell you this-- he will have some kind of plan for ya.
(many voices speaking)
I'll be seeing you.
Been celebrating, 11-12?
I'm not 11-12.
I'm only two's son.
That's all i'll ever be to anybody.
Three-one-three told me about the pills.
is your mother dying?
I thought one day...
Maybe one day, she would come back.
One day.
Come with us.
Leave.
Leave your father, leave all of this.
the village is best for me.
I live here.
This place is all i've got.
Besides, i got stuff to do,
Only i'm not nearly drunk enough, yet.
I'd like to get on with finishing the job.
(coughing)
(woman, softly) i think-think that's for me everyone.
i live here-- this place is all i've got.
All i've got.
I-i... because i live here... this place, it's... it's all i've got.
I don't think so.
Hi, how are you?
Dear, look, it's michael...
From summakor.
my wife, helen.
Helen is biochemist.
She studies the mind, the depths of the mind.
We all commonly accept the existence
Of the unconscious.
helen surmised that if there are two layers of consciousness, then why not more?
And if there are more, where are they and what are they?
What if we could go there?
And what if we could take with us all these broken people?
and let them fix themselves.
Nothing too clever-- just the simple virtues in life--
Dignitive labor, civic pride, family,
Sufficient to rekindle their lost purpose back on terra firma.
Your driver...
He was one of these people.
Well, yes-- there are hundreds more like him.
(laughing) michael, you found them.
Your work in summakor.
Spying on people.
No.
Protecting them.
Repairing them.
we all need that.
Helen was the first person ever in the village.
All those remarkable dreams.
Everything thought, every impulse within the village resides here in her mind.
No children of our own, her great heartbreak.
And we thought, we wondered, if it were possible
If we went there, that we could have a family.
(grunting)
What goes in that head?
Of course, this was not the plan.
Soon... (crying)
Not long now.
(whispering) he's here.
(crying)
(crying)
(two) look at the clock of the time.
small...
Or large?
Oh, i shall miss you.
Rest assured you will not go quietly.
Horse drawn carriage, and the village choir
Serenading you to your final resting place.
No excuse for dry eyes, i'll see to that.
And preferred hymns?
* when your heart begins to fail * * and your enemies avail *
* take you're burden to the lord * * and leave there
Mmm?
(weakly) i will die at the right time?
Yes, of course, you will.
(coughing) oh, it hurts, doesn't it?
But once the lid closes on that fine glass coffin,
The dance ends.
There be no escape, six.
Not for you.
(softly) eleven-twelve.
Eleven-twelve!
Eleven-twelve!
(crying)
(313 humming) * leave it there leave it there * * leave it there
(woman) don't look at me!
shut up!
* leave it there leave it there *
(softly) go.
* leave it there leave it!
* take your burdens to the lord * * and leave it there *
To lose a child-- there is nothing else like that.
Sir, if i'm allowed to say...
I'm sorry about 11-12.
yes, you are allowed because you know how it feels.
Can i ask you-- is what you feel evil?
I want it to stop-- i want it all to stop.
The madness of this world to stop.
Most days...
I don't know why i live.
i don't know why i breathe.
I go on, i drive, i wait and i wait
For this black pit feeling in my guts
To go away, but it don't.
No, it grows, sir.
that's what.
What if...
What we feel, what's happened to us,
Is for a purpose?
My son's death--
I can only bear it if it gives me clarity.
I had a dream last night--
A-a dream?
I dreamed clarity.
All of it.
Suppose your child's death
Gives you a place in village history-- gave you, 147, the moral courage to act
When moment comes.
To think what is unthinkable to do-- what can be done.
You like six, don't you?
Trust him?
yes, he's someone who can give us better village,
Moral village, freedom within the prison,
And when the moment comes, you will stand beside six
And you will call out that "six is the one."
"the one?"
"the one."
(two) look, over there.
dark suit, gray hair, you see?
Sure.
well, that man, the things he's seen.
He was an army veteran, stationed out of the middle east, who blew up a village school.
now look at him.
New wife, new life, new suit.
what a difference.
See that woman?
She was ruined by one street drug after another--
Look at her now.
Let me tell you, that woman--
I see.
I'm wasting my breath.
Nobody signed up for this.
None of these people asked to be fixed.
You mean, we should seek their permission?
I'm human.
I have a thousand flaws.
I break down, i get up, i don't get up.
i get lost.
I make the same mistakes over and over.
I have scars and wounds.
Sometimes when i can't bear them anymore, i-i drink.
You can't fix me.
You can't any of us.
You can't make us perfect.
But i'm not like them, am i?
You were keeping me quiet,
Because nobody resigns from summakor.
not on your watch, huh?
Am i right?
You just listen to yourself.
Your integrity, your vision.
We threw at you everything we had--
Love, loathing, death itself, and still you resist.
Well, now i see you are not the problem, michael.
you're a challenge, but an asset,
An opportunity to take us forward.
Oh, yes-- we're here.
Michael, come back to us, mmm?
(gasping)
You want him to live?
(313) yes.
At any cost?
I want him to live.
I can give you that.
(gasping, coughing weakly)
(two) that's why i wanted you to watch him here-- to see him.
You must answer a question honestly.
My son...
Am i the reason?
Yes.
Thank you.
There's something thrilling about honesty,
Don't you think?
To face yourself.
The inside two.
Six was right, i'll admit it.
Death was not enough to crack six open, but he was wrong.
Village death was not my last throw.
i have the perfect means of assimilation for him.
I know six better than six knows six.
He's in love with his own humanity.
He adores the sweet smell
Of his own bright shining conscience.
noble six.
He only wants to do the right thing.
And that is what will give him to me.
That...
And you.
(soft boom)
Me?
You want six to live...
Then i can give you your part in his fate.
When the moment comes, you will know,
And you will choose to give yourself to six.
Is that what you want?
Yes.
It's what i want.
(soft boom)
Your time's almost at an end.
If that is what you choose.
(weakly) let me out of here.
(two) i see no locked doors.
The village is in all of us, six.
i know you-- you want the village in you.
No...
I'm a free man.
More than anyone here, you love the village.
No, i have to escape.
Every breath, every thought,
I have is to get away.
(snarling) (gasping)
Then why do you conjure up this?
(clock ticking) to keep you in.
No...
It's not true.
I couldn't.
Look, six.
Look up!
look!
look at your fear-- see what you create with it.
I w-won't believe you.
I won't believe-- i will not do it!
Don't-- let me go!
I have no power over you.
I never did have-- you know that, six.
If you truly want to go, you must find the open door,
Rather than the beast that keeps you here.
So which is to be, six?
the door or the beast?
which does six choose to see?
* leave it there * oh leave there * take your burden to the lord and leave it there * * if you trust and never doubt * * he will surely bring you out * * take your burden to the lord and leave it there *
(six) they have to get out.
there are holes everywhere.
You have to let them out.
this isn't about escape.
Oh?
It's about survival.
How you feeling, six?
the fever's gone.
* leave it there * leave it there * take your burden to the lord * * and leave it there * if you trust and never doubt * * he will surely bring you out * (rumbling) * take your burden to the lord and leave it there *
Eleven-twelve chose--
He chose to kill himself,
Because he felt he was a prisoner here...
And so he was.
Six here-- he's told you the truth a thousand times.
you are all prisoners!
(rumbling)
(313) don't look at me.
shut up!
shut up!
shut-shut-shut--
What is this?
(313) shut up!
Everything has a price.
The price of free will, michael.
I said, "don't look at me!"
don't look at me .
What is she doing?
One never quite knows with sarah.
(whispering) knock-knock.
Knock-knock.
Must be a dozen tales like her in every parish.
It's the experience of trauma as a child.
How terrible, so unspeakable.
"put it on your head."
(crying) noooo!
(two) she's quite out of reach.
nobody can help her.
shut up, shut up!
shut up!
(crying)
(two) i tried so hard with sarah, and for a time, she prospered, but lately, she's begun to resist the village
And this is what she's condemned to.
this prison.
(147) how do stop them?
how do we shut the holes?
you have to help.
(two) how do we close the holes-- i wish i knew.
But i-i can do nothing, and soon,
We will face the same abyss.
I can hear her.
It's how life begins-- crying out.
I can see her.
Blindly groping through the dark.
Sh...
If only there were some way back...
But we can do, my friends,
Is breathe in, breathe out...
More... village.
Breathe in with me, breathe out.
Come on.
More... village.
I hate you!
(all gasping)
(two) breathe out.
more... village.
There must be something--
You can do.
(two) not now, not anymore.
Sarah.
I said, "don't look at me."
Unless--
Ask him!
Six is the one.
Six.
six is the one.
We want six.
Six is the one.
We want six.
One word from you-- help me.
Help me fix these people, michael.
you are the one.
(all) six is the one.
we want six.
six is the one-- we want six.
six is the one-- we want six.
Six is the one we've been waiting for.
Six will save us all.
six will save all of us.
What are you doing?
In your left-hand pocket.
(all) six is the one-- we want six.
(two) there's only one way to close the holes.
We must find a dreamer.
Pity six, poor little six.
One word.
No.
Please.
let me.
I want to.
i know what i'm doing.
For you.
For all this.
Till you find a better way.
Go on.
Sarah.
Three-one-three.
Too late.
(two) two little pills,
The yellow one for you and another for me.
Time to wake up now.
Six, i give you the village.
(six) it's called "new york."
(two) the manufactured-- who are you?
how do i get in?
(147) if i open my mind--
(six) something's wrong here.
I keep trying to prove i'm right.
(man) i think we found something.
It's the village.
I think it would help me to tell you.
it got away.
they're meddling with my mind.
(man) ordinary people--
(six) "be seeing you."
nothing's real-- what-- you think i'm insane?
what is this place?
I am not a number.
I'm a free man!
i want to get back to new york.
i need you to help me in some other life.
(two) helen!
helen!
Helen?
Home.
home.
At last.
You look--
You flatterer.
(chuckling)
Been making wraps.
See, some things never change.
Oh, come here.
curtis-- shh...
Don't look back.
(many voices speaking)
(beach boys's "i know there's an answer")
* i know so many people * * who think can do it alone * * they isolate their heads * * and stay in their safety zone *
There are people here, good people.
Whatever they've lost.
Funny, isn't it?
It took me all this time to see how beautiful it is.
What if-- oh!
It has to be possible to do this the right way.
Yeah, make a good village.
I think i could do it.
I think we have to try.
Whatever the cost.
* now how can i come on * * and tell them the way that they live * * could be better * i know there's an answer * * i know now but i have to find it by myself *

(coughing)
I know you don't want to yet...
The time is coming...
When you wanna tell me...
To give me the information
To get us all outta here...
To get you outta here.
(coughing)
Does your mother care for you, six?
Mine does.
I believe she does.
Only a mother can destroy every ounce of hope in ya.
(chuckling)
(horns honking)
(coughing)
(bells tolling)
(clocks ticking quickly)
So, what are you gonna do?
You just gonna let them do this you?
Listen to me.
I met someone who might be able to help you.
Now this guy-- this guy is deep.
This guy's got cures.
Hey!
One-four-seven.
I make it, ah, 10 till, which gives us 24 minutes
To get across to mr. curtis and we don't wanna be late.
People usually like to be early for mr. curtis.
(horns blaring)
Hey, you like to ride?
hmm.
'cause i like to ride.
Man, time was, i was so crazy i thought every single car
On the street was out to get me
And i just had to get 'em first.
And i just wanted to hurt somebody.
and now?
now?
Now, i'm a baby.
Now i'm seeing the world through fresh eyes.
It's like my brain has had a wash.
Like, ah, a spring clean of the frontal lobe.
You know what i mean?
(speaking foreign language)
What is this?
Something's coming.
Do you feel it?
And all we have to do is wait.
(six) no, can't you see that's crazy?
Waiting is giving up.
They keep us here to control our minds up there.
You were there now driving a car, right now, driving me.
Man!
I mean, look at this-- it's my little girl.
i mean, this is an old one but, uh, ain't she something?
huh?
And mr. curtis has had a word with the judge and he says if i keep making progress,
They gonna let me see her again.
Mr. curtis ain't nothing but a kind man.
he's a great man.
No, that's the most insanest thing i've ever heard.
We gotta get ourselves outta here-- come on!
Right now, you're dying
And everyone knows dead men don't have no hope.
What does this great man want with me?
(laughing)
I'm just a driver, man.
I don't know his plans.
but i will tell you this-- he will have some kind of plan for ya.
(many voices speaking)
I'll be seeing you.
Been celebrating, 11-12?
I'm not 11-12.
I'm only two's son.
That's all i'll ever be to anybody.
Three-one-three told me about the pills.
is your mother dying?
I thought one day...
Maybe one day, she would come back.
One day.
Come with us.
Leave.
Leave your father, leave all of this.
the village is best for me.
I live here.
This place is all i've got.
Besides, i got stuff to do,
Only i'm not nearly drunk enough, yet.
I'd like to get on with finishing the job.
(coughing)
(woman, softly) i think-think that's for me everyone.
i live here-- this place is all i've got.
All i've got.
I-i... because i live here... this place, it's... it's all i've got.
I don't think so.
Hi, how are you?
Dear, look, it's michael...
From summakor.
my wife, helen.
Helen is biochemist.
She studies the mind, the depths of the mind.
We all commonly accept the existence
Of the unconscious.
helen surmised that if there are two layers of consciousness, then why not more?
And if there are more, where are they and what are they?
What if we could go there?
And what if we could take with us all these broken people?
and let them fix themselves.
Nothing too clever-- just the simple virtues in life--
Dignitive labor, civic pride, family,
Sufficient to rekindle their lost purpose back on terra firma.
Your driver...
He was one of these people.
Well, yes-- there are hundreds more like him.
(laughing) michael, you found them.
Your work in summakor.
Spying on people.
No.
Protecting them.
Repairing them.
we all need that.
Helen was the first person ever in the village.
All those remarkable dreams.
Everything thought, every impulse within the village resides here in her mind.
No children of our own, her great heartbreak.
And we thought, we wondered, if it were possible
If we went there, that we could have a family.
(grunting)
What goes in that head?
Of course, this was not the plan.
Soon... (crying)
Not long now.
(whispering) he's here.
(crying)
(crying)
(two) look at the clock of the time.
small...
Or large?
Oh, i shall miss you.
Rest assured you will not go quietly.
Horse drawn carriage, and the village choir
Serenading you to your final resting place.
No excuse for dry eyes, i'll see to that.
And preferred hymns?
* when your heart begins to fail * * and your enemies avail *
* take you're burden to the lord * * and leave there
Mmm?
(weakly) i will die at the right time?
Yes, of course, you will.
(coughing) oh, it hurts, doesn't it?
But once the lid closes on that fine glass coffin,
The dance ends.
There be no escape, six.
Not for you.
(softly) eleven-twelve.
Eleven-twelve!
Eleven-twelve!
(crying)
(313 humming) * leave it there leave it there * * leave it there
(woman) don't look at me!
shut up!
* leave it there leave it there *
(softly) go.
* leave it there leave it!
* take your burdens to the lord * * and leave it there *
To lose a child-- there is nothing else like that.
Sir, if i'm allowed to say...
I'm sorry about 11-12.
yes, you are allowed because you know how it feels.
Can i ask you-- is what you feel evil?
I want it to stop-- i want it all to stop.
The madness of this world to stop.
Most days...
I don't know why i live.
i don't know why i breathe.
I go on, i drive, i wait and i wait
For this black pit feeling in my guts
To go away, but it don't.
No, it grows, sir.
that's what.
What if...
What we feel, what's happened to us,
Is for a purpose?
My son's death--
I can only bear it if it gives me clarity.
I had a dream last night--
A-a dream?
I dreamed clarity.
All of it.
Suppose your child's death
Gives you a place in village history-- gave you, 147, the moral courage to act
When moment comes.
To think what is unthinkable to do-- what can be done.
You like six, don't you?
Trust him?
yes, he's someone who can give us better village,
Moral village, freedom within the prison,
And when the moment comes, you will stand beside six
And you will call out that "six is the one."
"the one?"
"the one."
(two) look, over there.
dark suit, gray hair, you see?
Sure.
well, that man, the things he's seen.
He was an army veteran, stationed out of the middle east, who blew up a village school.
now look at him.
New wife, new life, new suit.
what a difference.
See that woman?
She was ruined by one street drug after another--
Look at her now.
Let me tell you, that woman--
I see.
I'm wasting my breath.
Nobody signed up for this.
None of these people asked to be fixed.
You mean, we should seek their permission?
I'm human.
I have a thousand flaws.
I break down, i get up, i don't get up.
i get lost.
I make the same mistakes over and over.
I have scars and wounds.
Sometimes when i can't bear them anymore, i-i drink.
You can't fix me.
You can't any of us.
You can't make us perfect.
But i'm not like them, am i?
You were keeping me quiet,
Because nobody resigns from summakor.
not on your watch, huh?
Am i right?
You just listen to yourself.
Your integrity, your vision.
We threw at you everything we had--
Love, loathing, death itself, and still you resist.
Well, now i see you are not the problem, michael.
you're a challenge, but an asset,
An opportunity to take us forward.
Oh, yes-- we're here.
Michael, come back to us, mmm?
(gasping)
You want him to live?
(313) yes.
At any cost?
I want him to live.
I can give you that.
(gasping, coughing weakly)
(two) that's why i wanted you to watch him here-- to see him.
You must answer a question honestly.
My son...
Am i the reason?
Yes.
Thank you.
There's something thrilling about honesty,
Don't you think?
To face yourself.
The inside two.
Six was right, i'll admit it.
Death was not enough to crack six open, but he was wrong.
Village death was not my last throw.
i have the perfect means of assimilation for him.
I know six better than six knows six.
He's in love with his own humanity.
He adores the sweet smell
Of his own bright shining conscience.
noble six.
He only wants to do the right thing.
And that is what will give him to me.
That...
And you.
(soft boom)
Me?
You want six to live...
Then i can give you your part in his fate.
When the moment comes, you will know,
And you will choose to give yourself to six.
Is that what you want?
Yes.
It's what i want.
(soft boom)
Your time's almost at an end.
If that is what you choose.
(weakly) let me out of here.
(two) i see no locked doors.
The village is in all of us, six.
i know you-- you want the village in you.
No...
I'm a free man.
More than anyone here, you love the village.
No, i have to escape.
Every breath, every thought,
I have is to get away.
(snarling) (gasping)
Then why do you conjure up this?
(clock ticking) to keep you in.
No...
It's not true.
I couldn't.
Look, six.
Look up!
look!
look at your fear-- see what you create with it.
I w-won't believe you.
I won't believe-- i will not do it!
Don't-- let me go!
I have no power over you.
I never did have-- you know that, six.
If you truly want to go, you must find the open door,
Rather than the beast that keeps you here.
So which is to be, six?
the door or the beast?
which does six choose to see?
* leave it there * oh leave there * take your burden to the lord and leave it there * * if you trust and never doubt * * he will surely bring you out * * take your burden to the lord and leave it there *
(six) they have to get out.
there are holes everywhere.
You have to let them out.
this isn't about escape.
Oh?
It's about survival.
How you feeling, six?
the fever's gone.
* leave it there * leave it there * take your burden to the lord * * and leave it there * if you trust and never doubt * * he will surely bring you out * (rumbling) * take your burden to the lord and leave it there *
Eleven-twelve chose--
He chose to kill himself,
Because he felt he was a prisoner here...
And so he was.
Six here-- he's told you the truth a thousand times.
you are all prisoners!
(rumbling)
(313) don't look at me.
shut up!
shut up!
shut-shut-shut--
What is this?
(313) shut up!
Everything has a price.
The price of free will, michael.
I said, "don't look at me!"
don't look at me .
What is she doing?
One never quite knows with sarah.
(whispering) knock-knock.
Knock-knock.
Must be a dozen tales like her in every parish.
It's the experience of trauma as a child.
How terrible, so unspeakable.
"put it on your head."
(crying) noooo!
(two) she's quite out of reach.
nobody can help her.
shut up, shut up!
shut up!
(crying)
(two) i tried so hard with sarah, and for a time, she prospered, but lately, she's begun to resist the village
And this is what she's condemned to.
this prison.
(147) how do stop them?
how do we shut the holes?
you have to help.
(two) how do we close the holes-- i wish i knew.
But i-i can do nothing, and soon,
We will face the same abyss.
I can hear her.
It's how life begins-- crying out.
I can see her.
Blindly groping through the dark.
Sh...
If only there were some way back...
But we can do, my friends,
Is breathe in, breathe out...
More... village.
Breathe in with me, breathe out.
Come on.
More... village.
I hate you!
(all gasping)
(two) breathe out.
more... village.
There must be something--
You can do.
(two) not now, not anymore.
Sarah.
I said, "don't look at me."
Unless--
Ask him!
Six is the one.
Six.
six is the one.
We want six.
Six is the one.
We want six.
One word from you-- help me.
Help me fix these people, michael.
you are the one.
(all) six is the one.
we want six.
six is the one-- we want six.
six is the one-- we want six.
Six is the one we've been waiting for.
Six will save us all.
six will save all of us.
What are you doing?
In your left-hand pocket.
(all) six is the one-- we want six.
(two) there's only one way to close the holes.
We must find a dreamer.
Pity six, poor little six.
One word.
No.
Please.
let me.
I want to.
i know what i'm doing.
For you.
For all this.
Till you find a better way.
Go on.
Sarah.
Three-one-three.
Too late.
(two) two little pills,
The yellow one for you and another for me.
Time to wake up now.
Six, i give you the village.
(six) it's called "new york."
(two) the manufactured-- who are you?
how do i get in?
(147) if i open my mind--
(six) something's wrong here.
I keep trying to prove i'm right.
(man) i think we found something.
It's the village.
I think it would help me to tell you.
it got away.
they're meddling with my mind.
(man) ordinary people--
(six) "be seeing you."
nothing's real-- what-- you think i'm insane?
what is this place?
I am not a number.
I'm a free man!
i want to get back to new york.
i need you to help me in some other life.
(two) helen!
helen!
Helen?
Home.
home.
At last.
You look--
You flatterer.
(chuckling)
Been making wraps.
See, some things never change.
Oh, come here.
curtis-- shh...
Don't look back.
(many voices speaking)
(beach boys's "i know there's an answer")
* i know so many people * * who think can do it alone * * they isolate their heads * * and stay in their safety zone *
There are people here, good people.
Whatever they've lost.
Funny, isn't it?
It took me all this time to see how beautiful it is.
What if-- oh!
It has to be possible to do this the right way.
Yeah, make a good village.
I think i could do it.
I think we have to try.
Whatever the cost.
* now how can i come on * * and tell them the way that they live * * could be better * i know there's an answer * * i know now but i have to find it by myself *
♪ Accordion
What do you think, kids?
Isn't it beautiful?
Where do you think the clinic is?
That's where 2 will be.
- Who are you people?
- Newcomers.
So...where have you come from?
- We just got offthe bus.
- But where did you get on the bus?
Well, the Village.
No, this is the Village - you've arrived here.
Well, isn't thatjust the wildest thing?
(Chuckles)
Ah, sir, your car is waiting.
Mr Curtis is expecting you in 44 minutes.
Your car is right outside.
In...43 minutes.
(Hammering)
(Bicycle bell)
(Groans)
They're building houses, bussing people in.
That has to mean something.
- Yeah.
More Village.
Be still, please.
- What is this, anyway?
- Your name was on the test list.
- The Village is all there is.
And now there are newcomers.
How can they say that's possible?
You're right.
I say it as though it were something ordinary.
We all say it. "More Village."
- (Groans)
- Oh, er...
What is it?
(Applause and rousing orchestral music)
Aren't they splendid?
Isn't this just the most wonderful thing?
They're buildings, houses.
1 1-12, you could not be more profoundly wrong.
- (Music blaring) - "More Village" means that our way of life is becoming the very consciousness ofthe universe.
I exaggerate, of course, but only slightly.
Oh, indulge me.
Take it all in.
(Inhales and exhales deeply)
This moment will be handed down through generations of our family.
(Chuckles)
There will be generations of our family, won't there, 1 1-12?
Yes.
I suppose.
(Laughing)
Oh, dear!
Oh, dear, 1 1-12.
You're so... earnest.
Take a tip from your old man.
Unbutton yourself.
Enjoy life.
Dance the night away with some darling girl.
(Laughing)
What is this?
Is it perhaps your certificate of dying?
Why now?
You could have killed me a thousand times.
I've tried every way I know to help you to belong, but still you refuse.
You choose.
This life...or no life.
Assimilate or die?
That is the great gift of Village death.
Clarity of choice.
Oh, 2, it's you!
2 in person!
I...
I would ask for your autograph, but I don't have a pen.
(Chuckles)
(Both laughing)
There are people here, 6.
Good people.
Newcomers.
Look at them.
Hi!
They choose life.
- But you...
- I'll find a way out before I die. (Coughing)
Oh, 6...
Let me give you the very secret of life.
Breathe in... (Coughs)
Breathe out.
(Coughing)
More...
Village.
(Coughing)
I shall watch you die...one breath at a time, 6.
One...
..tick ofthe clock at a time.
(Clicks tongue)
I said, "Don't look at me."
2:
Pity about poor old 6.
How does that make you feel, 313?
Be honest.
- If you can't confide in 2, who can you?
- I wish you... ..would help him.
There's something inside 6 that refuses to be unlocked.
And perhaps the prospect of death will unlock him.
Death unlocks us all.
And still he clings to his abstinence.
Freedom.
Such touching faiths - one envies him, almost.
But you and I know better.
(Sobbing)
We have measured the cost - wouldn't you say?
Don't look.
2:
Or am I wide ofthe mark?
- No.
- Don't let her rule you.
- Shut up.
- Lock her out.
Do you hear?
- Lock her out.
- I can't.
Put it on your head.
- The things she showed me.
The other...
- The other place?
It's in my head now, though.
I can'tjust rub it out.
- Can't or won't?
- Shut up!
Shut up.
2:
A little self control is all that is required... ..for 6's sake.
6:
You still come here?
What do you want from me, 6?
To kill someone you love because you love them...
The Village does that to you.
Don't you have to wonder what kinda place it is?
(6 coughing)
I know you don't want to yet... ..but the time is coming...
..when you'll wanna tell me... to give me the information...
..to get us all outta here.
To get you outta here. (Coughing)
Does your mother care for you, 6?
Mine does.
I believe she does.
Only a mother can destroy every ounce of hope in you.
(Car horns blaring)
(Coughing)
(Bell chiming and heart beating)
(Groaning and coughing)
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna let them do this to you?
- (Coughing)
- Listen to me.
I met someone who might be able to help you.
Now, this guy...this guy is deep.
(Coughing)
This guy's got cures.
- Hey.
- 147.
I make it ten till, which gives us 24 minutes to get across to Mr Curtis, and we don't wanna be late.
People usually like to be early for Mr Curtis.
(Coughing)
Hey, you like to ride?
Cos I like to ride. (Chuckles)
Man!
Time was, I was so crazy,
I thought every single car on the street was out to get me, and I just had to get 'em first.
Now, I just wanted to hurt somebody. (Chuckles)
- And now?
- Now?
Now I'm a baby.
(Chuckles) Now I'm seeing the world through fresh eyes.
It's like my brain has had a wash.
Like...a spring-clean ofthe frontal lobe.
You know what I mean?
147:
This way.
(Muttering softly in own language)
What is this?
Something's coming.
Do you feel it?
And all we have to do is wait.
(Muttering)
No.
Can't you see that's crazy?
Waiting is giving up.
They keep us here...
to control our minds up there.
You are there now, driving a car.
Right now, driving me.
Man...
I mean, look at this.
It's my little girl.
I mean, this is an old one, but er...
Ain't she something?
Huh?
And Mr Curtis has had a word with the judge, and he says, if I keep making progress, they're gonna let me see her again.
Mr Curtis ain't nothing but a kind man.
He's a great man.
No, that's the most insanest thing I've ever heard.
- We gotta get ourselves outta here.
Come on.
- Right now you're dying.
And everyone knows dead men don't have no hope.
- What does this great man want with me?
- (Laughs)
I'm just a driver, man.
I don't know his plans.
But I will tell you this.
He will have some kind of plan for you.
I'll be seeing you.
Been celebrating, 1 1-12?
I'm not 1 1-12.
I'm only 2's son.
That's all I'll ever be to anybody.
313 told me about the pills.
Is your mother dying?
I thought...one day...
..maybe one day, she would come back.
One day.
(Sniffling)
Come with us.
Leave.
Leave your father.
Leave all ofthis.
1 1-12:
The Village is best for me.
I live here.
This place is all I've got.
Besides...
I've got stuffto do - only, I'm not nearly drunk enough yet.
I'd like to get on with finishing the job.

I live here.
This place is all I've got.
(Whispering) All I've got.

I'm wasting my breath.
Nobody signed up for this.
None ofthese people asked to be fixed.
You mean, we should seek their permission?
I'm human.
I have a thousand flaws.
I break down.
I get up.
I don't get up.
I get lost.
I make the same mistakes over and over.
I have scars and wounds.
Sometimes, when I can't...bear them any more, I...
I drink.
You can't fix me.
You can't fix any of us.
You can't make us perfect.
But I'm not like them, am I?
You were keeping me quiet, because nobody resigns from Summakor.
Not on your watch, huh?
Am I right?
You just listen to yourself.
Your integrity, your vision.
We threw at you everything we had.
Love, loathing... ..death itself - and still you resist.
Well, now I see...you are not the problem, Michael.
You're a challenge, but an asset, an opportunity.
To take us forward.
Ah, yes.
We're here.
(Groaning)
You want him to live?
313:
Yes.
At any cost?
I want him to live.
I can give you that.
(Groaning)
That is why I wanted you to watch him here, to see him.
You must answer a question honestly.
My son...
Am I the reason?
Yes.
Thank you.
There's something thrilling about honesty.
Don't you think?
To face yourself.
The inside 2.
6 was right.
I'll admit it.
Death was not enough to crack 6 open, but he was wrong.
Village death was not my last throw.
I have the perfect means of assimilation for him.
I know 6 better than 6 knows 6.
He's in love with his own humanity.
He adores the sweet smell of his own bright, shining conscience.
Noble 6.
He only wants to do the right thing.
And that is what will give him to me.
That... ..and you.
- Me?
- You want 6 to live.
Then I can give you your part in his fate.
When the moment comes, you will know.
And you will choose...to give yourselfto 6.
Is that what you want?
Yes.
It's what I want.
Your time is almost at an end.
Ifthat is what you choose.
(Weakly) Let me out of...here.
I see no locked doors.
The Village is in all of us, 6.
I know you.
You want the Village in you.
No.
I'm a free man.
More than anyone here... ..you love the Village.
No, I have to...
Escape.
Every breath... every thought I have is to get away.
Then why do you conjure up this?
To keep you here.
No.
It's not true.
I couldn't.
Look, 6.
Look up!
2:
Look!
Look at your fear.
See what you create with it.
I...won't believe you.
I won't believe...
I will not...
Don't!
Let me go!
(Screams)
I have no power over you.
I never did have.
You know that, 6.
If you truly want to go... ..you must find the open door... rather than the beast that keeps you here.
So, which is it to be, 6?
The door or the beast?
Which does 6 choose to see?
Let me out of here!

313:
Don't look at me!
Shut up!
Shut up.

313:
Shut up!
- Everything has a price.
- (313 whimpering)
What price free will, Michael?
I said:
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me.
What is she doing?
One never quite knows with Sarah.
Must be a dozen tales like hers in every parish.
It's the experience oftrauma.
As a child, her terror was so unspeakable.
Put it on your head.
- No!
2:
She's quite out of reach.
Nobody can help her.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up.
(Crying) 2:
I tried so hard with Sarah.
And for a time she prospered but lately she's begun to resist the Village.
And this is what she's condemned to.
This prison.
147:
How do we stop them?
How do we shut the holes?
You have to help.
2:
How do we close the holes?
I wish I knew.
But I...
I can do nothing...
And soon...we will all face the same abyss.
(Moaning softly)
I can hear her.
It's how life begins, crying out.
I can see her... ..blindly groping through the dark.
Shh.
If only there were some way back.
But all we can do, my friends... ..is breathe in...
..breathe out.
More...
Village.
Breathe in with me!
Breathe out.
Come on!
More...
Village.
I hate you!
- (Shocked gasps)
- Breathe out.
More...
Village.
- There must be something...
- ..you can do.
2:
Not now, not any more.
Sarah...
I said:
Don't look at me!
Unless...
Ask him!
6 is the one.
6?
147: 6 is the one.
We...want...6.
6 is the one.
We want 6.
One word from you... 2:
Help me.
Help me fix these people, Michael.
You are the one.
6 is the one.
(Chanting) We want 6!
6 is the one.
We want 6. 6 is the one.
- We want 6!
- 6 is the one we've been waiting for.
6 will save us all.
6 will save all of us!
What are you doing?
In your left-hand pocket.
CROWD: (Chanting) 6 is the one!
We want 6.
There's only one way to close the holes.
We must find a dreamer.
Oh, pity 6.
Poor little 6.
One word.
No.
Please.
Let me.
I want to.
I know what I'm doing.
For you.
For all this.
Till you find a better way.
Go on.
Sarah... 313...
313:
Too late.
313:
Go.
2:
Two little pills.
The yellow one for you.
And another for me.
Time to wake up now.
6, I give you the Village.
(Shocked gasps)
- It's called New York.
- Manufactured.
- Who are you?
How do I get in?
- If I open my mind...
Something's wrong here.
I keep trying to prove I'm right.
- We found something.
- The Village.
- It would help me to tell you.
- He got away.
- Meddling with my mind.
- Ordinary people.
"Be seeing you."
Nothing's real.
What, you think I'm insane?
- What is this place?
- I am not a number.
I'm a free man!
I wanna get backto New York.
I need you to help me...in some other life.
2:
Helen!
Helen?
- Home.
- Home.
At last.
You look...
- You flatterer!

- Been making wraps.

Oh, come here.

Don't look back.

Where do you think the clinic is?
That's where Two be.
Who are you people?
Newcomers.
So, where have you come from?
We just got off the bus.
But where did you get on the bus?
Well, the village.
No, this is the village, you've arrived here.
Well, isn't that just the wildest thing?
Ah, sir, your car is waiting.
Mr. Curtis is expecting you in 44 minutes.
Your car is right outside.
In 43 minutes.
They're building houses, busing people in, that has to mean something.
Yeah, "More Village."
Be still, please.
What is this anyway?
Your name came up on the test list.
The village is all that there is, and now, there are newcomers.
How can they say that's possible?
You're right.
I say as though it was something ordinary.
We all say, "More Village."
Oh, uh...
What is it?
Aren't they splendid?
Isn't this just the most wonderful thing?
They're buildings, houses.
11-12, you could not be more profoundly wrong.
"More Village", means that our way of life is becoming the very consciousness of the universe.
I exaggerate, of course, but only slightly.
Oh, indulge me.
Take it all in.
This moment will be handed down through generations of our family.
There will be generations of our family,
Won't there, 11-12?
Yes.
I suppose.
Oh dear, oh dear, 11-12 you're so... earnest.
Take a tip from your old man..
unbutton yourself!
Enjoy life!
Dance the night away with some darling girl.
What is this?
Is it perhaps your certificate of dying?
Why now?
You coulda killed me a thousand times.
I've tried every way I know to help you to belong,
But still, you refuse.
You choose this life or no life.
Assimilate or die?
That is the great gift of village death.
Clarity of choice.
Oh Two, it's you.
Two in person.
I-I would ask for your autograph, but I don't have a pen.
There are people here, Six.
Good people.
Newcomers.
Look at them.
Hi!
They choose life.
But you.
I'll find a way out before I die.
Oh, Six.
Let me give the very secret of life.
Breath in...
Breath out.
More... village.
I shall watch you die, one breath at a time, Six.
One... tick of the clock at a time.
Tk, tk.
Tk, tk.
Tk, tk.
I said, "Don't look at me."
Pity about poor ol' Six.
How does that make you feel, 313?
Be honest.
If you can't confide in Two, who can you confide in?
I wish you'd..
would help him.
There's something inside Six that refuses to be unlocked, and perhaps the prospect of death will unlock him.
Death unlocks us all.
And still, he clings to his abstinence.
Freedom.
Such touching faiths, one envies him, almost.
But you and I know better.
I'm sorry.
We have measured the cost, wouldn't you say?
Don't look,
Or am I wide of the mark?
No.
Don't let her rule you.
Shut up...
Block her out of you.
Lock her out.
It's hard.
- Put it on your head.
The things she showed me.
The other..
- The other place?
It's in my head now, though.
I can't just rub it out.
Can't or won't?
Shut up!
Shut up!
Self-control is all that is required... for Six's sake.
Still come here?
What do you want from me, Six?
To kill someone you love because you love them, the village does that to you.
Don't you have to wonder what kinda place it is?
I know you don't want to yet...
The time is coming... when you wanna tell me...
To give me the information... to get us all outta here...
To get you outta here.
Does your mother care for you, Six?
Mine does.
I believe she does.
Only a mother can destroy every ounce of hope in ya.
So, what are you gonna do?
You just gonna let them do this you?
Listen to me.
I met someone who might be able to help you.
Now this guy, this guy is deep.
This guy's got cures.
Hey!
147.
I make it ten till, which gives us 24 minutes to get across to Mr. Curtis and we don't wanna be late.
People usually like to be early for Mr. Curtis.
Hey, you like to ride?
'cause I like to ride.
Man, time was, I was so crazy I thought every single car on the street was out to get me and I just had to get 'em first.
Now I just wanted to hurt somebody.
And now?
- Now?
Now, I'm a baby.
Now I'm seeing the world through fresh eyes.
It's like my brain has had a wash.
Like, a spring clean of the frontal lobe.
You know what I mean?
What is this?
Something's coming.
Do you feel it?
And all we have to do is wait.
No, can't you see that's crazy?
Waiting is giving up.
They keep us here to control our minds up there.
You were there now driving a car, right now, driving me.
Man!
I mean, look at this- it's my little girl.
I mean, this is an old one but, uh, ain't she something?
Huh?
And Mr. Curtis has had a word with the judge and he says if I keep making progress, they gonna let me see her again.
Mr. Curtis ain't nothing but a kind man.
He's a great man.
No, that's the most insanest thing I've ever heard.
We gotta get ourselves outta here, come on!
Right now, you're dying and everyone knows dead men don't have no hope.
What does this great man want with me?
I'm just a driver, man.
I don't know his plans.
But I will tell you this:
he will have some kind of plan for ya.
I'll be seeing you.
Been celebrating, 11-12?
I'm not 11-12.
I'm only Two's son.
That's all I'll ever be to anybody.
313 told me about the pills.
Is your mother dying?
I thought..
one day... maybe one day, she would come back.
One day.
Come with us.
Leave.
Leave your father Leave all of this!
The village is best for me.
I live here.
This place is all I've got.
Besides, I got stuff to do, only I'm not nearly drunk enough, yet.
I'd like to get on with finishing the job.
I think- think, that's for me, everyone.
I live here..
this place is all I've got.
All I've got.
I-I... because I live here... this place, it's... it's all I've got.
I don't think so.
Hi, how are you?
Dear, look, it's Michael... from Summakor.
My wife, Helen.
Helen is biochemist.
She studies the mind, the depths of the mind.
We all commonly accept the existence of the unconscious.
Helen surmised that if there are two layers of consciousness, then why not more?
And if there are more, where are they and what are they?
What if we could go there?
And what if we could take with us all these broken people and let them fix themselves.
Nothing too clever, just the simple virtues in life..
Dignitive labor, civic pride, family,
Sufficient to rekindle their lost purpose back on terra firma.
Your driver... he was one of these people.
Well, yes..
there are hundreds more like him.
Michael, you found them.
Your work in Summakor.
Spying on people.
No.
Protecting them.
Repairing them.
We all need that.
Helen was the first person ever in the village.
All those remarkable dreams.
Everything thought, every impulse within the village resides here in her mind.
No children of our own, her great heartbreak.
And we thought, we wondered, if it were possible if we went there, that we could have a family.
What goes in that head?
Of course, this was not the plan.
Soon...
Not long now.
He's here.
Look at the clock of the time.
Small... or large?
Oh, I shall miss you.
Rest assured you will not go quietly.
Horse drawn carriage, and the village choir serenading you to your final resting place.
No excuse for dry eyes, I'll see to that.
And preferred hymns?
* When your heart begins to fail *
* And your enemies avail *
* Take you're burden to the lord *
* And leave it there *
Mmm?
I will die at the right time?
Yes, of course, you will.
Oh, it hurts, doesn't it?
But once the lid closes on that fine glass coffin, the dance ends.
There'll be no escape, Six.
Not for you!
11-12.
11-12!
11-12!
* Leave it there, leave it there *
* Leave it there *
Don't look at me!
Shut up!
* Leave it there, leave it there *
Go.
* Leave it there * leave it!
* Take your burdens to the lord *
* And leave it there *
To lose a child..
there is nothing else like that.
Sir, if I'm allowed to say...
I'm sorry about 11-12.
Yes, you are allowed because you know how it feels.
Can I ask you, is what you feel evil?
I want it to stop!
I want it all to stop,
The madness of this world to stop.
Most days...
I don't know why I live.
I don't know why I breathe.
I go on, I drive, I wait and I wait for this black pit feeling in my guts to go away, but it don't.
No, it grows, sir,
That's what!
What if... what we feel, what's happened to us, is for a purpose?
My son's death..
I can only bear it if it gives me clarity.
I had a dream last night..
A-a dream?
I dreamed clarity.
All of it.
Suppose your child's death gives you a place in village history..
Gave you, 147, the moral courage to act when the moment comes.
To think what is unthinkable to do.. what can be done.
You like Six, don't you?
Trust him?
Yes, he's someone who can give us better village, moral village, freedom within the prison, and when the moment comes, you will stand beside Six and you will call out that "Six is the one."
"The one?"
"The one."
Look, over there.
Dark suit, gray hair, do you see?
Sure.
- Well, that man, the things he's seen.
He was an army veteran, stationed out of the middle east, who blew up a village school.
Now look at him.
New wife, new life, new suit.
What a difference.
See that woman?
She was ruined by one street drug after another, and look at her now.
Let me tell you, that woman.
I see
I'm wasting my breath.
Nobody signed up for this.
None of these people asked to be fixed.
You mean, we should seek their permission?
I'm human.
I have a thousand flaws.
I break down, I get up.
I don't get up.
I get lost.
I make the same mistakes over and over.
I have scars and wounds.
Sometimes when I can't bare them anymore, I-I drink.
You can't fix me.
You can't any of us.
You can't make us perfect.
But I'm not like them, am I?
You were keeping me quiet, because nobody resigns from Summakor.
Not on your watch, huh?
Am I right?
You just listen to yourself, your integrity, your vision.
We threw at you everything we had:
love, loathing, death itself, and still you resist.
Well, now I see you are not the problem, Michael.
You're a challenge, but an asset, an opportunity..
to take us forward.
Oh, yes-- we're here.
Michael, come back to us, mmm?
You want him to live?
Yes.
At any cost?
I want him to live.
I can give you that.
That's why I wanted you to watch him here.. to see him.
You must answer a question honestly.
My son... am I the reason?
Yes.
Thank you.
There's something thrilling about honesty, don't you think?
To face yourself.
The inside Two.
Six was right, I'll admit it.
Death was not enough to crack Six open, but he was wrong.
Village death was not my last throw.
I have the perfect means of assimilation for him.
I know Six better than Six knows Six.
He's in love with his own humanity.
He adores the sweet smell of his own bright shining conscience.
Noble Six.
He only wants to do the right thing and that is what will give him to me.
That... and you.
Me?
You want Six to live...
Then I can give you your part in his fate.
When the moment comes, you will know, and you will choose to give yourself to Six.
Is that what you want?
Yes.
It's what I want.
Your time's almost at an end.
If that is what you choose.
Let me out of here.
I see no locked doors.
The village is in all of us, Six.
I know you.. you want the village in you.
No...
I'm a free man.
More than anyone here, you love the village.
No, I have to escape.
Every breath, every thought,
I have is to get away.
Then why do you conjure up this?
To keep you in.
No...
It's not true.
I couldn't.
Look, Six.
Look up!
Look!
Look at your fear..
see what you create with it.
I w-won't believe you.
I won't believe-- I will not do it!
Don't..
Let me go!
I have no power over you.
I never did have, you know that, Six.
If you truly want to go, you must find the open door, rather than the beast that keeps you here.
So which is to be, Six?
The door or the beast?
Which does Six choose to see?
* Leave it there *
* Oh leave it there *
* Take your burden to the lord and leave it there *
* If you trust and never doubt *
* He will surely bring you out *
* Take your burden to the lord and leave it there *
They have to get out.
There are holes everywhere.
You have to let them out.
This isn't about escape.
Oh?
It's about survival.
How you feeling, Six?
The fever's gone.
* Leave it there *
* Leave it there *
* Take your burden to the lord *
* And leave it there *
* If you trust and never doubt *
* He will surely bring you out *
* Take your burden to the lord and leave it there *
11-12 chose..
He chose to kill himself, because he felt he was a prisoner here...
And so he was.
Six here.. he's told you the truth a thousand times.
You are all prisoners!
Don't look at me!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut-shut-shut..
What is this?
Shut up!
Everything has a price.
The price of free-will, Michael.
I said, "don't look at me!"
Don't look at me .
What is she doing?
One never quite knows with Sarah.
Knock-knock.
Knock-knock.
Must be a dozen tales like hers in every parish.
It's the experience of trauma as a child.
How terrible, so unspeakable.
"Put it on your head."
Noooo!
She's quite out of reach.
Nobody can help her.
Shut up, shut up!
Shut up!
I tried so hard with Sarah, and for a time, she prospered, but lately, she's begun to resist the village and this is what she's condemned to:
This prison.
How do stop them?
How do we shut the holes?
You have to help.
How do we close the holes, I wish I knew.
But I-I can do nothing, and soon, we will face the same abyss.
I can hear her.
It's how life begins, crying out.
I can see her, blindly groping through the dark.
Sh...
If only there were some way back...
But we can do, my friends, is breathe in, breathe out...
More.. village.
Breathe in.. with me, breathe out.
Come on!
More.. village.
I hate you!
Breathe out.
More.. village.
There must be something..
you can do.
Not now, not anymore.
Sarah.
I said, "don't look at me."
Unless..
Ask him!
Six is the one.
Six.
Six is the one.
We want Six.
Six is the one.
We want Six.
One word from you..
Help me.
Help me fix these people, Michael.
You are the one.
Six is the one.
We want Six.
Six is the one..
We want Six.
Six is the one..
We want Six.
Six is the one we've been waiting for.
Six will save us all.
Six will save all of us.
What are you doing?
In your left-hand pocket.
Six is the one..
We want Six.
There's only one way to close the holes.
We must find a dreamer.
Pity Six, poor little Six.
One word.
No.
Please.
Let me.
I want to.
I know what I'm doing.
For you.
For all this, till you find a better way.
Go on.
Sarah.
313.
Too late.
Two little pills, the yellow one for you and another for me.
Time to wake up now.
Six, I give you the village.
It's called "New York."
The manufactured..
Who are you?
How do I get in?
If I open my mind..
Something's wrong here.
I keep trying to prove I'm right.

The village is all that there is and now, there are newcomers.
How can they say that's possible?
You're right.
I say as though it was something ordinary.
We all say, "more village."
What is it?
aren't they splendid?
Isn't this just the most wonderful thing?
They're buildings, houses.
Eleven-twelve, you could not be more profoundly wrong.
More village, means that our way of life
Is becoming the very consciousness of the universe.
I exaggerate, of course, but only slightly.
Oh, indulge me.
Take it all in.
This moment will be handed down
Through generations of our family.
There will be generations of our family,
Won't there, 11-12?
Yes.
i suppose.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, 11-12 you're so...
Earnest.
Take a tip from your old man--
Unbutton yourself, enjoy life.
Dance the night away with some darling girl.
what is this?
Is it perhaps your certificate of dying?
Why now?
You coulda killed me a thousand times.
I've tried every way i know to help you to belong,
But still, you refuse.
You choose this life or no life.
Assimilate or die?
that is the great gift of village death.
Clarity of choice.
Oh two, it's you.
Two in person.
I-i would ask for your autograph
But i don't have a pen.
There are people here, six.
Good people.
Newcomers.
Look at them.
Hi!
They choose life.
But you--
I'll find a way out before i die.
Oh, six.
Let me give the very secret of life.
Breath in...
Breath out.
More... village.
I say, once you die, one breath at a time, six.
One...
Tick of the clock at a time.
i said, "don't look at me."
pity about poor ol' six.
how does that make you feel, 313?
be honest.
If you can't confide in two, who can you confide in?
I wish you'd--
Would help him.
There's something inside six that refuses to be unlocked.
And perhaps the prospect of death will unlock him.
death unlocks us all.
and still, he clings to his abstinence.
Freedom.
Such touching faiths-- one envies him, almost.
but you and i know better.
i'm sorry.
We have measured the cost, wouldn't you say?
don't look.
or am i right at the mark?
no.
Don't let her rule you.
shut up...
Block her out of you.
lock her out.
it's hard. put it on your head.
The things she showed me.
the other-- the other place?
It's in my head now, though.
I can't just rub it out.
Can't or won't?
shut up!
shut up!
self-control is all that is required...
For six's sake.
Still come here?
What do you want from me, six?
To kill someone you love because you love them.
the village does that to you.
Don't you have to wonder what kinda place it is?
I know you don't want to yet...
The time is coming...
When you wanna tell me...
To give me the information
To get us all outta here...
To get you outta here.
Does your mother care for you, six?
Mine does.
I believe she does.
Only a mother can destroy every ounce of hope in ya.
So, what are you gonna do?
You just gonna let them do this you?
Listen to me.
I met someone who might be able to help you.
Now this guy-- this guy is deep.
This guy's got cures.
One-four-seven.
I make it, ah, 10 till, which gives us 24 minutes
To get across to mr. curtis and we don't wanna be late.
People usually like to be early for mr. curtis.
Hey, you like to ride?
hmm. 'cause i like to ride.
Man, time was, i was so crazy i thought every single car
On the street was out to get me
And i just had to get 'em first.
And i just wanted to hurt somebody.
and now?
now?
Now, i'm a baby.
Now i'm seeing the world through fresh eyes.
It's like my brain has had a wash.
Like, ah, a spring clean of the frontal lobe.
You know what i mean?
What is this?
Something's coming.
Do you feel it?
And all we have to do is wait.
no, can't you see that's crazy?
Waiting is giving up.
They keep us here to control our minds up there.
You were there now driving a car, right now, driving me.
Man!
I mean, look at this-- it's my little girl.
i mean, this is an old one but, uh, ain't she something?
And mr. curtis has had a word with the judge and he says if i keep making progress,
They gonna let me see her again.
Mr. curtis ain't nothing but a kind man.
he's a great man.
No, that's the most insanest thing i've ever heard.
We gotta get ourselves outta here-- come on!
Right now, you're dying
And everyone knows dead men don't have no hope.
What does this great man want with me?
I'm just a driver, man.
I don't know his plans.
but i will tell you this-- he will have some kind of plan for ya.
I'll be seeing you.
Been celebrating, 11-12?
I'm not 11-12.
I'm only two's son.
That's all i'll ever be to anybody.
Three-one-three told me about the pills.
is your mother dying?
I thought one day...
Maybe one day, she would come back.
One day.
Come with us.
Leave.
Leave your father, leave all of this.
the village is best for me.
I live here.
This place is all i've got.
Besides, i got stuff to do,
Only i'm not nearly drunk enough, yet.
I'd like to get on with finishing the job.
i think-think that's for me everyone.
i live here-- this place is all i've got.
All i've got.
I-i... because i live here... this place, it's... it's all i've got.
I don't think so.
Hi, how are you?
Dear, look, it's michael...
From summakor.
my wife, helen.
Helen is biochemist.
She studies the mind, the depths of the mind.
We all commonly accept the existence
Of the unconscious.
helen surmised that if there are two layers of consciousness, then why not more?
And if there are more, where are they and what are they?
What if we could go there?
And what if we could take with us all these broken people?
and let them fix themselves.
Nothing too clever-- just the simple virtues in life--
Dignitive labor, civic pride, family,
Sufficient to rekindle their lost purpose back on terra firma.
Your driver...
He was one of these people.
Well, yes-- there are hundreds more like him.
michael, you found them.
Your work in summakor.
Spying on people.
No.
Protecting them.
Repairing them.
we all need that.
Helen was the first person ever in the village.
All those remarkable dreams.
Everything thought, every impulse within the village resides here in her mind.
No children of our own, her great heartbreak.
And we thought, we wondered, if it were possible
If we went there, that we could have a family.
What goes in that head?
Of course, this was not the plan.
Soon...
Not long now.
he's here.
look at the clock of the time.
small...
Or large?
Oh, i shall miss you.
Rest assured you will not go quietly.
Horse drawn carriage, and the village choir
Serenading you to your final resting place.
No excuse for dry eyes, i'll see to that.
And preferred hymns?
* when your heart begins to fail * * and your enemies avail *
* take you're burden to the lord * * and leave there
i will die at the right time?
Yes, of course, you will.
oh, it hurts, doesn't it?
But once the lid closes on that fine glass coffin,
The dance ends.
There be no escape, six.
Not for you.
eleven-twelve.
Eleven-twelve!
Eleven-twelve!
* leave it there leave it there * * leave it there don't look at me!
shut up!
* leave it there leave it there * go.
* leave it there leave it!
* take your burdens to the lord * * and leave it there *
To lose a child-- there is nothing else like that.
Sir, if i'm allowed to say...
I'm sorry about 11-12.
yes, you are allowed because you know how it feels.
Can i ask you-- is what you feel evil?
I want it to stop-- i want it all to stop.
The madness of this world to stop.
Most days...
I don't know why i live.
i don't know why i breathe.
I go on, i drive, i wait and i wait
For this black pit feeling in my guts
To go away, but it don't.
No, it grows, sir.
that's what.
What if...
What we feel, what's happened to us,
Is for a purpose?
My son's death--
I can only bear it if it gives me clarity.
I had a dream last night--
A-a dream?
I dreamed clarity.
All of it.
Suppose your child's death
Gives you a place in village history-- gave you, 147, the moral courage to act
When moment comes.
To think what is unthinkable to do-- what can be done.
You like six, don't you?
Trust him?
yes, he's someone who can give us better village,
Moral village, freedom within the prison,
And when the moment comes, you will stand beside six
And you will call out that "six is the one."
"the one?"
"the one."
look, over there.
dark suit, gray hair, you see?
Sure. well, that man, the things he's seen.
He was an army veteran, stationed out of the middle east, who blew up a village school.
now look at him.
New wife, new life, new suit.
what a difference.
See that woman?
She was ruined by one street drug after another--
Look at her now.
Let me tell you, that woman--
I see.
I'm wasting my breath.
Nobody signed up for this.
None of these people asked to be fixed.
You mean, we should seek their permission?
I'm human.
I have a thousand flaws.
I break down, i get up, i don't get up.
i get lost.
I make the same mistakes over and over.
I have scars and wounds.
Sometimes when i can't bear them anymore, i-i drink.
You can't fix me.
You can't any of us.
You can't make us perfect.
But i'm not like them, am i?
You were keeping me quiet,
Because nobody resigns from summakor.
not on your watch, huh?
Am i right?
You just listen to yourself.
Your integrity, your vision.
We threw at you everything we had--
Love, loathing, death itself, and still you resist.
Well, now i see you are not the problem, michael.
you're a challenge, but an asset,
An opportunity to take us forward.
Oh, yes-- we're here.
Michael, come back to us, mmm?
You want him to live?
yes.
At any cost?
I want him to live.
I can give you that.
that's why i wanted you to watch him here-- to see him.
You must answer a question honestly.
My son...
Am i the reason?
Yes.
Thank you.
There's something thrilling about honesty,
Don't you think?
To face yourself.
The inside two.
Six was right, i'll admit it.
Death was not enough to crack six open, but he was wrong.
Village death was not my last throw.
i have the perfect means of assimilation for him.
I know six better than six knows six.
He's in love with his own humanity.
He adores the sweet smell
Of his own bright shining conscience.
noble six.
He only wants to do the right thing.
And that is what will give him to me.
That...
And you.
Me?
You want six to live...
Then i can give you your part in his fate.
When the moment comes, you will know,
And you will choose to give yourself to six.
Is that what you want?
Yes.
It's what i want.
Your time's almost at an end.
If that is what you choose.
let me out of here.
i see no locked doors.
The village is in all of us, six.
i know you-- you want the village in you.
No...
I'm a free man.
More than anyone here, you love the village.
No, i have to escape.
Every breath, every thought,
I have is to get away.
Then why do you conjure up this?
to keep you in.
No...
It's not true.
I couldn't.
Look, six.
Look up!
look!
look at your fear-- see what you create with it.
I w-won't believe you.
I won't believe-- i will not do it!
Don't-- let me go!
I have no power over you.
I never did have-- you know that, six.
If you truly want to go, you must find the open door,
Rather than the beast that keeps you here.
So which is to be, six?
the door or the beast?
which does six choose to see?
* leave it there * oh leave there * take your burden to the lord and leave it there * * if you trust and never doubt * * he will surely bring you out * * take your burden to the lord and leave it there *
they have to get out.
there are holes everywhere.
You have to let them out.
this isn't about escape.
It's about survival.
How you feeling, six?
the fever's gone.
* leave it there * leave it there * take your burden to the lord * * and leave it there * if you trust and never doubt * * he will surely bring you out * * take your burden to the lord and leave it there *
Eleven-twelve chose--
He chose to kill himself,
Because he felt he was a prisoner here...
And so he was.
Six here-- he's told you the truth a thousand times.
you are all prisoners!
don't look at me.
shut up!
shut up!
shut-shut-shut--
What is this?
shut up!
Everything has a price.
The price of free will, michael.
I said, "don't look at me!"
don't look at me .
What is she doing?
One never quite knows with sarah.
knock-knock.
Knock-knock.
Must be a dozen tales like her in every parish.
It's the experience of trauma as a child.
How terrible, so unspeakable.
"put it on your head."
noooo!
she's quite out of reach.
nobody can help her.
shut up, shut up!
shut up!
( i tried so hard with sarah, and for a time, she prospered, but lately, she's begun to resist the village
And this is what she's condemned to.
this prison.
how do stop them?
how do we shut the holes?
you have to help.
how do we close the holes-- i wish i knew.
But i-i can do nothing, and soon,
We will face the same abyss.
I can hear her.
It's how life begins-- crying out.
I can see her.
Blindly groping through the dark.
Sh...
If only there were some way back...
But we can do, my friends,
Is breathe in, breathe out...
More... village.
Breathe in with me, breathe out.
Come on.
More... village.
I hate you!
breathe out.
more... village.
There must be something--
You can do.
not now, not anymore.
Sarah.
I said, "don't look at me."
Unless--
Ask him!
Six is the one.
Six.
six is the one.
We want six.
Six is the one.
We want six.
One word from you-- help me.
Help me fix these people, michael.
you are the one.
six is the one.
we want six.
six is the one-- we want six.
six is the one-- we want six.
Six is the one we've been waiting for.
Six will save us all.
six will save all of us.
What are you doing?
In your left-hand pocket.
six is the one-- we want six.
there's only one way to close the holes.
We must find a dreamer.
Pity six, poor little six.
One word.
No.
Please.
let me.
I want to.
i know what i'm doing.
For you.
For all this.
Till you find a better way.
Go on.
Sarah.
Three-one-three.
Too late.
( two little pills,
The yellow one for you and another for me.
Time to wake up now.
Six, i give you the village.
it's called "new york."
the manufactured-- who are you?
how do i get in?
if i open my mind-- something's wrong here.
I keep trying to prove i'm right.
i think we found something.
It's the village.
I think it would help me to tell you.
it got away.
they're meddling with my mind.
ordinary people--
"be seeing you."
nothing's real-- what-- you think i'm insane?
what is this place?
I am not a number.
I'm a free man!
i want to get back to new york.
i need you to help me in some other life.
helen!
helen!
Helen?
Home. home.
At last.
You look--
You flatterer.
Been making wraps.
See, some things never change.
Oh, come here.
curtis-- shh...
Don't look back.
* i know so many people * * who think can do it alone * * they isolate their heads * * and stay in their safety zone *
There are people here, good people.
Whatever they've lost.
Funny, isn't it?
It took me all this time to see how beautiful it is.
What if-- oh!
It has to be possible to do this the right way.
Yeah, make a good village.
I think i could do it.
I think we have to try.
Whatever the cost.
* now how can i come on * * and tell them the way that they live * * could be better * i know there's an answer * * i know now but i have to find it by myself *
In the criminal justice system,
The people are represented by two separate Yet equally important groups
The police who investigate crime
And the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders.
These are their stories..
- All right, a little bit more.
Come on, Allie, come on.
You can do better than that.
Let yourself go.
Nice.
Oh, my god.
Give me a pout.
Come on.
Feel the clothes against your skin, baby.
There you go.
That's it.
Think nasty thoughts.
I love it.
It's beautiful.
Hey.
Hey!
We're trying to sell clothes here, man.
These are for billboards.
You gotta think big.
- I got it, Sid.
I got it.
[laughter]
- Who are they?
- I don't know.
- If I'm not paying you to be here, get the hell out.
[laughter]
Am I paying you?
- I'm the dj.
I spin records at one of your stores.
- Oh, so you put this song on?
You're fired!
You know what?
In fact, everybody, get out!
Everybody, let's go!
Come on, out!
Okay?
Not you, baby.
Everybody else.
I'll finish the shoot myself.
Thank you.
Out!
Come on, baby.
That's it.
Okay.
Oh, my god!
I love it!
Oh, yeah, that's it.
- D.O.A.'s name is Sid Maxwell.
The neighbor came home at 3:00 a.M.
And saw the door propped open.
Almost had a heart attack when he saw the body.
- What do we got, a sex mishap?
- If it was erotic asphyxia, he miscalculated.
No fluids.
He lost consciousness too soon.
- The guy could've saved himself just by standing up.
- Pushing the limits is part of the thrill.
But if you take it a little too far...
- No happy ending.
These look like tights.
Double-knotted.
He's supposed to have done this himself?
- He could've tied his hands in front,
Then stepped over them, like this.
I'm just speculating.
It's not from experience.
- Good.
There was a photo shoot going on?
- [exhales] tripod, no camera.
Here's the photographer's name.
- Yeah.
Looks like he missed the best shot.
- I gotta get going.
We just caught a fresh one.
- I'll alert the criminals you're on your way.
- May be no criminals involved.
Just solo sex gone horribly wrong.
- Solo sex?
That has to be wrong.
- Well, here we go.
First day of the new me.
What do you think?
- I always had a thing for Grace Jones.
You're beautiful.
- Sid seemed fine yesterday.
Manic.
Total prick, like always.
You can be that way if you're rich, I guess.
- How did he get rich?
- By starting skintight apparel.
He was the sexy underwear king of the lower east side.
He threw everybody out around 6:00, including me.
- He threw the photographer out of a photo shoot?
- Sid liked to do things himself.
- Yeah.
So we gather.
- The girl stayed behind, though.
- The model?
- Model, hooker, girlfriend, employee of the month.
It was kind of a fluid position.
- Uh-huh.
- Sid and I met when I was working three jobs
And sharing a loft with six roommates.
He hired me on the spot.
- Hired you to do what, exactly?
Hold up.
- Anything Sid wanted.
Working in the store, modeling.
- Spotting for him during s m sessions?
- Sid said he wanted to try something new.
I didn't want to seem like a prude.
He just wanted me to watch.
- So did you?
- I told him I had to go get cigarettes at the store.
I was weirded out.
I just went home.
- So you just left him hanging there
With his hands tied behind his back?
- No.
His hands were not tied when I left.
- Did any of his staff have complaints?
- Yeah, there was one girl.
She got pretty freaked out.
I think she sued him.
- That son of a bitch.
He pulled my top off at a photo shoot
At the st.
Patrick's day parade.
No warning.
Just, "oops, you're naked."
- And that was more than what you bargained for?
- My job description didn't say "get raped by leprechauns."
Sid's lawyers said I should have understood
I was working in a highly-sexualized environment.
- Well, it sounds like you had a good case.
- We'll never know.
Sid's lawyers buried my guy in so many motions,
I couldn't afford to keep going.
I lost.
Sid won.
- When was the last time you saw Mr. Maxwell?
- I don't know.
Six months.
- No contact after that?
- I told myself the one good thing
Was I'd never have to hear his voice again.
And I didn't.
And now I never will.
- Huh.
This guy had a way with women.
All sex all the time.
- His company sells five-Dollar t-shirts for $40.
Sex is part of the brand.
- And his model-slash- girlfriend-slash-whatever
Was fine with that?
- According to her.
- The building's surveillance camera
Shows her leaving Maxwell's place at 10:00.
Then it stopped working.
- Well, that's a coincidence.
- She left the apartment door ajar
So she could get back in.
The building door had a keypad lock.
Maxwell gave her the number,
But she took off for brooklyn instead.
- Where an atm saw her withdrawing cash at 10:30.
Time of death was after midnight.
- Sag paneer, loo?
- Oh, no thanks.
Me and food aren't getting along that great.
- "you are a hideous pig."
Uh, it's, uh, "I heard your lawyer quit.
Now how are you going to pay for the boob job you need?"
It's a text message between Sid Maxwell and Bonnie Allman,
The girl who sued him.
- She said she hadn't heard from him in six months.
- She said she hadn't heard his voice.
Maxwell sent this to her last Monday.
Yeah.
Tuesday, Maxwell filed a complaint.
His car was vandalized.
- Bonnie Allman strikes back?
- "text this, scumbag!"
- Yeah.
"love, Bonnie"?
- She saved the ten cents it would cost to reply by text,
And this was so much more satisfying.
- The car doesn't look like it's been driven
Since the incident.
The driver's window is smashed,
With shards of glass embedded in the seat.
Whoever did this used some force.
- Yeah.
Somebody cared.
- I've got some prints where the basher
May have leaned in to slash the upholstery.
I'll get them over to latents.
- No match.
The prints on the car don't belong to Bonnie Allman.
- Do they match anyone we know?
- Got a dozen hits for a guy named Todd bissell.
He's a perp that was arrested
For public lewdness 12 years ago.
- Okay.
B-I--two ss?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Mr. Bissell.
Am I nuts, or is that Sid Maxwell with a moustache?
- 12 years ago, lean and hungry.
He must have changed his name
When he became the underwear king.
- Okay.
Let's see what else he was up to as Todd bissell.
- What's that?
- "flashposse.Net.
A site dedicated to righting social wrongs."
- Is he typing on that with both hands?
- Yeah, and flashposse is mad.
"this idiot veered into my lane on the fdr today.
He was texting while driving.
I could have been killed."
Look at this one from Freddy-six in long island.
"somebody needs to kill him before he does kill someone."
- How'd they know who it was?
- Hmm, "I identified the car and model
"from its dashboard and then hacked into dmv records
"for every '79 Mercedes that color in New York,
"New Jersey and Connecticut.
"I found one that is registered
To someone named Todd bissell."
- Mm-hmm.
- They posted his address.
"326 bowery, apartment 11a,
"in case anybody wants to drop by
And teach this jerk some manners."
- Somebody did.
- It's not a blog.
It's a forum for corrective social action.
- Yeah, well, it struck me like a well-chummed shark tank.
- Look, if somebody lets their dog crap on the sidewalk,
That's an offense to everybody that walks by, right?
This is just a way of striking back.
- So you take a picture of the owner,
Find out who they are,
Post their address and phone number.
- So people can tell them what they think.
If they shove dog crap in our faces,
They can take a phone call.
- Hmm.
How do you get this information?
- Flashposse.Net has thousands of visitors.
Between us, we have a lot of expertise,
A lot of connections.
- In China they call it a human flesh search engine.
- Yeah, there was a woman there,
She posted a video of herself
Stepping on a kitten and killing it.
Just her shoe and the kitten.
People blew up the video,
They found out where the shoe came from,
They identified a building in the background.
- They found out who it was.
She lost her job, she had to go into hiding.
- Do you feel bad for her?
I don't.
- We're here about a man named Todd bissell,
And as far as I know, he didn't massacre any cats.
- Bissell's just as bad.
Do you know how dangerous texting while driving is?
- Yeah.
"somebody should kill this guy."
From your website.
I didn't realize it deserved the death penalty.
- You never heard of hyperbole, detective?
- It wasn't hyperbole.
Todd bissell was murdered.
- Under his other name, Sid Maxwell.
- And you think we had something to do with that?
- We'd like the names of your members
Who posted threats against Mr. Bissell.
- No.
- Hmm.
We are the police, Mr. Leary.
And it's our job to take "corrective social action."
- No.
- All right, all right.
- Well, the comments on the website are pretty intense.
- The comments on that website are probably free speech.
It's not going to be easy to uphold a subpoena.
- Is this free speech?
It's from the site.
This is Maxwell's vandalized car.
- You think the guy who vandalized the car
Took the picture?
- We can't prove it.
- Neither can I.
Listen, if you can show the flashposse's hot air
Has real world consequences, I might be able
To convince a judge to give us those names.
- Well, that site goes after a lot of people.
- Find me a good one.
- I thought the worst thing that could happen
Was when my husband committed suicide.
Then, a month later, the phone calls started.
People I didn't know.
They called me a whore.
They said it was my fault.
The website posted excerpts from my husband's diary
That it got from his parents.
They said I had an affair
And that's why Donald killed himself.
I asked the website to take them down.
They said they were providing a public service,
Letting the public decide what was right and what was wrong.
- It's my understanding that Mr. Leary offered ms.
Davies
The chance to tell her side of the story.
- I'm supposed to go on a public website
And tell the world I had an affair,
But my husband had 20, and he was clinically depressed?
Isn't that private?
Shouldn't that be private?
Who made you god?
Why don't you leave people alone?
- Okay, okay.
Thank you, ma'am.
Okay, now what does that have to do with this subpoena?
- It demonstrates that threats made on Mr. Leary's website
Have consequences.
- Ms. Rubirosa is talking about
Constitutionally-protected opinions.
The subpoena should be quashed.
- No, I am talking about
Specific threats made to kill a man
Who soon after was killed.
- That's venting.
It's hot air.
"I could kill that guy who stole my parking place."
It's a figure of speech.
- Not to Rebecca Davies, it's not, as we just heard.
- If anyone harassed that woman, arrest them.
They committed a crime.
But people who expressed opinions on a website did not.
- I feel sorry for the lady, ms.
Rubirosa.
I really do.
But I honestly don't see what she has to do with Mr. Maxwell.
- Rubirosa just called.
[cell phone rings]
No subpoena for the names.
- Bernard.
- So we find another way.
- Who is this?
Hey, screw you.
- I'm guessing that wasn't your mother.
- Somebody calling me a Nazi.
You know, an hour ago, somebody called,
Telling me that I needed to go on a diet.
- Maybe that was your mother.
- No.
[typing] [computer beeps]
Oh, flashposse.Net.
- "detective Kevin Bernard.
Call and tell him what you think."
- Oh, they even posted your cell phone number.
Thoughtful.
- My unlisted number.
Somebody hacked it.
- "corrective social action."
[computer beeps]
- New post coming in.
"this cop bully should be ashamed of himself."
- You know, if we were set up right,
We could trace these messages as they're posted.
That's when the links are open.
- So we wouldn't need a subpoena.
- Just a big juicy target to get the ranters ranting.
- What about lupo?
He's juicy.
- [laughs] thank you.
But four years in intel.
We don't want anyone digging through that.
- Plus, you seem to be the one they like, detective.
- These guys are good.
They've got your credit record up now
And police reports.
Were you arrested for speeding in California in 1996?
- Look, I got a ticket.
I paid the fine.
- Okay, and here is billyboy14.
"this cop is an outrage.
A policeman's first duty is to protect our liberties."
And here is our trace on billyboy.
- Where is he?
- He's in astoria.
- All right, write him back.
- Okay, what's my screen name?
- "detective Bernard."
We want them to know it's you.
- All right.
[typing]
"my first duty is to arrest criminals
Who hide behind bogus free speech."
- Hmm, nice.
All right, looking good.
You know how to piss them off.
- My special talent.
- [laughs] any of these screen names
Match the people who threatened Sid Maxwell?
- Uh, yeah, one or two.
Hit 'em again.
- "you're cowards and you're stupid."
[laughter]
- Okay, okay, we are matching, matching...
Tracing, tracing...
- Wow.
Oh, they hate you, b.
They really hate you.
- I see.
Wow.
- I was just blowing off steam.
That's not against the law.
- Hey.
"if he can't keep his hands on the wheel
"and eyes on the road, maybe he ought to lose them.
Taliban justice."
- It was a joke.
- "this guy should be tied in the middle of fdr drive
While texting drivers try to Dodge him,"
Says sly-avenger.
That's you, right?
- Well, that's not what happened
To him, though, is it?
- I'm so embarrassed.
Some of the things I wrote about that man, I--
My language was inappropriate.
- Well, frankly, ms.
Sands, you don't seem like the type.
- I know.
It's just... [exhales]
Three years ago, my daughter was killed
By a taxi driver who was texting.
- I'm so sorry.
- They never caught him.
And when I saw the photo of that man texting,
Not even looking at the road...
Some other child could have been hurt.
- Maybe I can look into what happened to your daughter.
- That would be...
Thank you.
- Someone hacked into the security system
At Sid Maxwell's building the night he was killed.
You worked as a security systems engineer.
- So?
- This is a photo of Maxwell's vandalized car,
Uploaded from your I.P. Address.
If your prints are found in his apartment,
You're screwed.
- I'm screwed?
A, I didn't kill anybody.
B, it's not my social security number
That got posted online this morning.
- So I should be going.
Is there anything else?
- No, no.
We have your-- your name and your address.
- Thank you for your concern.
- Lieutenant, that information you requested...
- Ms. Sands,
If you don't mind,
Could you come back and sit for a minute?
- We checked accident reports from three years ago,
And there was no report
Involving a taxi and a child.
- I saw it happen.
- And you do have a daughter, but she didn't die.
Social services took her away from you
Because you offered her to a catholic church
As a human sacrifice.
- I don't believe in human sacrifices.
- Ms. Sands,
Were you at Mr. Maxwell's apartment Friday night?
- He was getting messages from the devil.
- Who was?
Mr. Maxwell?
- Not just him.
- He tells them whom to kill.
- Uh...
Who tells who whom to kill?
Mr. Maxwell?
The devil?
- May I please see a lawyer now?
- Ms. Sands has informed me
That she has nothing else to say at this time.
- Except that people who get texts while they drive
Are servants of the devil.
- Except that.
- She already mentioned
That Sid Maxwell was one of those servants.
- So you say.
I wasn't here.
- Do you want to add anything else, ms.
Sands?
- That man was evil.
If you don't know that, you shouldn't be a policeman.
- Crazy enough for you?
- Oh, yeah.
Do you have any evidence against her for the murder?
- So far, just her rants against Maxwell on the website.
- Well, that and this--it's enough for a search warrant.
- Wow.
- Texting while driving...
Texting while driving...
Todd bissell...
Todd bissell...
- This must be Kerry sands' daughter,
The one who isn't actually dead.
- Ah, yeah, the state takes her daughter away
And she can't deal with it, and she comes up with this?
I don't see the connection.
- Hey, check it out.
That's the girl from the photo session
The night bissell a.K.A. Maxwell was killed.
Looks like ms.
Sands took a souvenir.
- That would put her on the scene,
But how did she get in the building?
- 8-4-2-6.
That's the entry Code,
Right next to a picture of the keypad.
- And that's Maxwell's apartment door, propped open.
Looks like a security camera still.
- Yeah, a camera that mysteriously went dark.
- She was the one who hacked into the security system?
- No.
The header says flashposse.Net,
Her friendly neighborhood social justice website.
- There's no time or date on this.
If she got this stuff the night of the murder,
That would nail things down.
- The flashposse computer would show when they were posted.
- Hey, can we go find out with a warrant, please?
- I'm calling my lawyer.
- Yeah, when you do,
Tell him "the cop bully" is here
With a search warrant this time.
- Hey, you can't take that.
- You'll get it back.
- There's some more gear back here.
Anything else you want me to take?
- Ah, let me check.
- This is harassment.
- No.
Calling my cell phone and telling me I'm a Nazi,
That's harassment.
- Oh, is that what this is about?
You can't stand a little heat?
- Look, I'm doing my job.
This is about a murder and a woman named Kerry sands.
Do you know her?
- The woman whose kid wasn't killed by a taxi?
Yeah.
We're open to the public.
We take all comers.
- That's it.
You ready to go?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Bye.
- Here's the full dump of material
From the Sid Maxwell section of flashposse.Net.
- Yeah, the good stuff was in a password-protected area
For people who had a special interest in Mr. Maxwell.
- The Code to his building's front door?
- Right, just in case somebody wanted to drop by.
Ms. Sands accessed this photo just after midnight.
A few minutes later,
She takes a car service to Maxwell's apartment.
- Do you have the driver?
- Mm-hmm.
He remembers her pretty well.
She told him she doesn't take taxis
Because of their link to the devil.
- Hmm.
Arrest her for murder, and I will apply with the court
For a 7:30 exam.
- I found the police report you filed
About the taxi striking your daughter.
- The police didn't do anything.
They wouldn't do anything.
- The report says they investigated.
The taxi hit a garbage can.
Nobody was injured.
Why would it say that?
- [sighs]
Do I have to explain everything to you?
- Do you mind?
- Oh, I don't know.
Will you help me?
- Help you do what?
- Stop the killing.
Stop the evil.
- Like Sid Maxwell?
Was he evil?
- He got a message when he was driving.
That's when they send the messages.
They think no one can see.
- What do the messages say?
- Whom to kill.
- So Sid Maxwell was going to kill someone?
- Isn't that why we're here?
- And you were supposed to do something about that?
- There was no point calling the police.
That report proves that.
No, I had to take care of that man myself.
So I did.
- She's a pretty well-managed schizophrenic.
It's not immediately obvious.
- Unless you start talking about texting while driving?
- Or about the devil.
He sends messages to his servants
While they're in their cars,
Telling them which pure-hearted people to kill.
- But she tried to have her own daughter killed
By human sacrifice.
- For purification.
Her delusion was a little different then.
When the state took her daughter away,
It rattled her reality.
That same day,
She saw a taxi driver plow into a garbage can.
The garbage can became her daughter.
The taxi driver became evil.
Suddenly everything made sense.
- Perfectly.
- Is ms.
Sands competent to stand trial?
- No, and if she ever is, the verdict will be
"not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect."
She needs to be locked up, for everybody's good.
- Call judge hiram and the woman's attorney.
Work out a plan for institutionalization.
Thank you, doctor.
- I'll book some time in the grand jury.
- What for?
The woman's insane.
- Not for her.
Did you see the file on flashposse.Net?
- That place on the world wide web?
- Actually, they don't call it that anymore.
- Excuse me, should I have said "wireless telegraph"?
- Flashposse whipped up a frenzy against Sid Maxwell.
It was a virtual Lynch mob.
- A Lynch mob sitting at computers, typing things?
- Yeah, things like "this guy ought to be killed"
And "here's how to get into his apartment."
All delivered into the hands of a crazy woman.
- "a person is guilty of murder
"when they recklessly engage in conduct
"which creates a grave risk of death to another person,
And thereby causes the death of another person."
- I know the law.
- The shoe fits, Jack.
Kerry sands was the bullet;
the website was the gun.
- You really want to do this?
You'll be pushing the limits, trying to make new law.
- Like you did with gun manufacturers
And justice department torture memo writers?
- So these flashposse people,
Whom exactly are you planning to indict?
- All of them.
- All of these people are parties to this motion?
- Not by choice, your honor.
For some strange reason, the district attorney
Has chosen to indict half of New York city
For the murder of Sid Maxwell.
- Only because they all helped kill him.
- It's preposterous.
A schizophrenic named Kerry sands murdered Sid Maxwell,
As the state freely acknowledges.
These people did nothing but post comments
On a website that ms.
Sands occasionally visited.
- Is that true, Mr. Cutter?
- "post comments" is an understatement.
They encouraged ms.
Sands
To commit violence against Mr. Maxwell.
- If I yell "kill the umpire" and some psychotic does it,
I'm not guilty of murder.
- The website went beyond exhortations
To kill Mr. Maxwell.
It gave instructions on how to do it.
Some of its members took actions that enabled ms.
Sands
To enter and leave his apartment undetected.
- What are we talking about here,
Exhortations or actions?
- In this case, your honor, it's a pretty fine line.
- Not to me.
Any comment about Mr. Maxwell, even negative ones,
Are protected speech and may not be used
In any way in your prosecution.
- There is the first amendment exception
About shouting "fire" in a crowded theater.
- Were any of these people in physical proximity
To ms.
Sands or the victim?
- No.
- Then the theater wasn't crowded.
You are free to proceed in accordance with my ruling,
If you still have a case.
- Do we?
- We'd better.
If we don't stop them now, who's next?
- You're lucky the judge didn't throw your case out entirely.
- She's living in the 20th century.
Words on the internet have consequences.
- Actually, she's living in the 18th century,
When the bill of rights was written,
Which, on balance, is a good thing.
- Well, if it weren't for what people on that website
Said and did,
Kerry sands would have never murdered Sid Maxwell.
- Yes, but now you'll have to forget about the "said."
- I'm dropping the charges against the cheerleaders,
But I'm still moving against the guy who ran the site
And the people who sent out the photos and the door Code.
- They'll say they were only encouraging people
To send Maxwell a message,
That they never intended for him to be killed.
- They were dealing with a crazy woman.
They didn't have to intend for her to kill him.
If they recklessly disregarded
The likelihood that it would happen, they're guilty.
- Good luck.
- "thank you for sharing the information
About this accomplice of the devil."
That was one of the messages posted by Kerry sands
On the Sid Maxwell section of the website.
- And how many messages
Did ms.
Sands post there altogether?
- More than 400.
- And who posted the second largest amount
Of messages there?
- Someone with the screen name kewpie-doll.
She posted 22.
- 22 versus 400.
Now did ms.
Sands' messages stand out in any other way?
- No one else mentioned Satan.
No one else mentioned that god's angels
Would take vengeance on Mr. Maxwell
And dance in his evil blood.
- Would you characterize her messages as sane?
- Objection.
The witness is a psychiatrist.
Her judgment isn't the same
As that of a layperson reading those messages.
- I'll sustain that.
- Dr. Olivet, please read some more of ms.
Sands' postings.
- "god's angels will sing in heaven
"when this man gets his just reward.
"death shall be answered with death,
The lord commands us."
- "death shall be answered with death."
- Pursuant to a search warrant,
We seized a computer server from the residence of Mr. Leary
And turned it over to our computer crimes squad.
- And what did that squad determine?
- That Mr. Keegan had hacked into
And manipulated the security cameras
At Mr. Maxwell's apartment building,
And Mr. Mason cracked and posted the Code
To the front door of his building,
While ms.
Sands obtained that information from the website
Less than an hour before she murdered Mr. Maxwell.
- Was there any sign
The defendants attempted to limit ms.
Sands' access
To that kind of information
After they saw her hundreds of messages on the website
About the devil and angels
And death and doom and blood?
- No.
In fact, Mr. Leary made a point
Of sending private e-mails to ms.
Sands,
Alerting her whenever new information was posted.
- Really?
To your knowledge, detective,
Was Mr. Leary aware of ms.
Sands' delusional condition?
- Yes.
When we executed the warrant,
I asked him if he knew ms.
Sands, and he said,
"the lady whose kid wasn't killed by a taxi?
Yeah."
- So he knew she was delusional?
- That's what he said, yes.
- Thank you.
- You don't like Mr. Leary, do you?
- I don't like him or not like him.
- But when he objected to your investigation of his website,
Didn't he organize people to call you
And accuse you of being fat and a Nazi?
- Those people never said who told them to call.
- Oh, so you didn't know that your phone number
Was listed on Mr. Leary's website?
- I knew.
- When you served the warrant for his computers,
Didn't you complain that he had been harassing you?
- I might have mentioned that.
- Did you or didn't you accuse him of harassing you?
- I did.
And he was.
- So now you're telling us that this man,
Who was harassing you, told you and only you
That he knew that ms.
Sands was delusional.
- Yes.
- Aren't you making that up 'cause it makes him look
Like he was guilty of something?
- No.
- 'cause you want to get back at the man
Who was harassing you?
- No.
- You're not lying?
- No.
- Really?
Detective Bernard, can you tell us who's in this picture?
I have a copy for the district attorney.
- Where did you get this?
- Online, posted by a classmate of yours
From the police academy
At some kind of graduation celebration.
That is you in the picture, isn't it?
- Objection.
What is the relevance of this?
- It goes to the credibility of this witness,
Which will become apparent very soon.
- It had better.
Proceed.
- Thank you.
Detective, who is the young woman in the picture?
- Her name is Rosemary.
- Rosemary Franklin.
Is that correct?
- Yes.
- Did you and she have a child together?
- Yes.
- And did you sign a child support agreement with her
Before the baby was born?
- Well, you know everything.
Why ask me?
- Your honor.
- Yes.
- Did you sign an agreement promising to pay ms.
Franklin
$500 a month to support that child?
And did you fail to send that money three times
In the first six months?
- There was a question about paternity.
- Did you promise to pay and then fail to do so?
- If you lied to the mother of your child
About supporting your son,
Why should we believe anything you say to us now?
- You couldn't do something to stop that?
- No.
No, I couldn't.
- Hey, you have a kid?
- Look, I'd just finished the academy, all right?
I busted loose a little.
There were some cop groupies at a bar.
Once the blood test came back, I paid every month.
- Look, we'll bring that out on redirect.
We have to recoup.
- Look, I don't want to talk about it!
Hey.
Hey!
- B!
- How much trash did your people have to sort through
To dig this up?
- The photo, the agreement, the violations,
It's all on the internet.
You just gotta know how to look.
- Yeah, so this is how you defend yourself, huh?
Dragging people through the mud?
He's a ten-year-old boy.
- All right, come on, b.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
You want to play dirty, huh?
Huh?
You want to get personal?
- Detective!
- That didn't help.
- What do you expect?
- That a thin-skinned cop doesn't destroy my case.
- Mike.
- Look, do you realize
How much his testimony is worth right now?
- All right, listen.
Leary told him he knew about Kerry sands and her daughter.
- Yes, but who's going to believe it?
- I do.
You do.
All we have to do is find out
How Leary knew the woman is nuts.
We get that into evidence, it won't matter
What he did or didn't say to Bernard.
- Okay, okay, but Leary's not going to tell us,
And Kerry sands is in cuckoo-land,
So how are we going to find out?
- There's got to be a record somewhere--
A meeting, a conversation, an e-mail.
- Something somewhere.
Pretty big haystack.
- He was texting on the fdr drive
And almost ran a car with three kids in it off the road.
One of our members analyzed the photo
And determined it was going 73 miles per hour at the time.
Sid Maxwell deserved to be exposed.
The point was to get him to change his ways
Before he killed someone.
- But not to kill him?
- We're not murderers.
We spend our days in front of computers.
We're just a bunch of well-meaning nerds
Who want to make this city a better place.
- Thank you.
- So you and your colleagues don't get out much?
Then why did you post Mr. Maxwell's address
On your site?
- In case somebody wanted to write him a letter.
- And the Code to his building's door?
From your website, uh,
"in case anybody wants to drop by
And teach this jerk some manners."
- Some people feel very strongly
About people like Sid Maxwell.
There was a woman in China who crushed--
- I know.
Crushed a kitten.
So emotions run high?
- They can.
Sometimes people want to confront
People like that in person.
Sometimes that's the only way
People like that get the message.
- "people like that." including Sid Maxwell?
- Yes, but that doesn't mean that I,
Or anyone else on flashposse.Net,
Thought he'd be physically harmed.
- Not even by Kerry sands,
Who posted 400 messages
About revenge and the devil and death?
- Have you ever read the internet, Mr. Cutter?
It's full of ranting and raving and exaggerated threats.
Everyone says everyone else should drop dead.
It's just a place for letting off steam.
- So you thought Kerry sands
Was just letting off harmless steam?
- She and 50 million other people.
- Even though you knew she was living
In the midst of a psychotic delusion.
- I didn't know that.
- You told detective Bernard.
- I never told him that.
Couldn't have.
I didn't know it.
- It's from lupo.
- Mr. Leary,
Were you with Kerry sands last August 20th
When she physically assaulted a cabdriver
Who she accused of being the evil spawn of Satan?
- Uh, your honor, this is the first we've heard
Of any such alleged incident.
If the people have some supposed evidence,
I'd like to see it.
- New information has just come to our attention.
- Then share it with the defense.
We'll recess until tomorrow.
[gavel bangs]
- Now we knew Kerry sands
Had a thing for cabdrivers, right?
Well, there are cabs around all the time,
So I figured she might have had some interaction.
It was just a matter of checking drivers' logs.
- There are 13,000 taxis in New York city.
- All right, so it was kind of labor-intensive.
Now, there were 209
That reported violent behavior by women in the last year.
102 of those were on the street
In range of atm or other security cameras.
- That's hundreds of cameras, all on different systems.
- Right, so here's a camera still of Kerry sands
Assaulting a driver on 42nd street.
I talked to the driver.
He said she was screaming
That the devil told him to murder her daughter.
- And to find him, you searched 13,000 taxi logs
And then every security camera near 209 incidents?
- Sort of.
The driver also told me there was a man with Kerry sands.
He walked away after she started getting violent.
This is him, right here.
- All I can see is the back of his head.
- You see the reflection in the store window there?
With the right software, boom.
- Leary.
- Did you have a subpoena for the cameras
For any of this?
- I'm not the one who got 'em.
This took a few thousand people working around the clock.
- The entire nypd?
- Chinese people.
A "human flesh search engine."
I have a friend in the shanghai p.D.
From my days in intel.
I told him a cop needed a hand.
- Fire with fire.
Our internet posse against Leary's.
- And none of these came from Leary's home or office.
- It's admissible.
- Mr. Leary, can you tell us
What's happening in this picture?
- Your honor, may we approach?
- We're still not satisfied
As to the origin of this material.
- Why, it came from a lamppost security camera.
- Where'd the state get it?
There's no record of any process being served.
- It doesn't matter.
Mr. Leary has no expectation of privacy
In the middle of 42nd street.
- Even if he didn't,
There's no context to explain what's happening here.
- I'll ask him to explain, and if he can't remember,
Then we'll bring in the taxi driver.
- That works, Mr. Margolis.
Mr. Cutter, you may proceed.
- Now you told us yesterday, Mr. Leary,
That you had no idea
Kerry sands was violent or delusional.
Doesn't this picture show us that you did know?
- That's arguable.
- It was a crazy, violent outburst
Right in front of your face.
But you still kept goading her to go after Sid Maxwell.
- [exhales]
[sighs]
I never told her to kill anybody.
- The woman was dangerously out of control.
What did you expect?
What did you reasonably expect?
- Yeah.
All right.
That was cutter.
Leary and the others took pleas.
They're going away for manslaughter.
- Good.
- Thank you.
[clears throat]
You know,
If we'd have known...
I mean, I would have
Put myself out there as the target.
- I never thought they would dig that up.
- How is the kid?
- His mother and I...
She ended up marrying her actual boyfriend.
We both decided that it would be better--
Less confusing-- if I didn't see him.
Who the fuck is malcolm sloan
And why the hell is he having
A wake for my daughter, anthony?
- I'm malcolm.
What is your fucking game?
- Why the fuck am I here?
- What would you do if you came
Face to face with your daughter's killer, ben?
you killed her.
- You killed my child.
- Ben?
Ben?
- Ben, ben, ben!
- Ahh.
Look, these motherfuckers put ben in the hospital,
They threatened his family, our family
And I know they killed cassie.
It's time they fucking admit it.
Seth has a meningioma.
It's--
It's a lesion on his brain.
The hallucinations will get worse.
I made a miraculous recovery.
I've appointed tess c o-executive director of byzantium.
Somebody mind telling me what that means?
It means that you, maggie and everyone else
Can get off my back about this goddamn operation.
You are fucking fired.
I want you out of here
- By the end of today.
- You've got it.
Let me purify you, so his spirit can enter inside your body.
Don't be afraid.
I need to cleanse you.
You almost fucking killed her!
What's the matter with you?
Our future together is gonna be great.
I promise.
- Did you tell bauer you're my manager?
I have nothing but your best interests at heart.
Jimmy, this is my one shot.
If I blow it, I'm back in the club forever.
You're not my manager.
I got the part, baby.
- What?
- I got the part.
- Dollar for food, man?
- Get a fucking job.
Bo's not a bully.
I don't know where he learned that beastly behavior.
-
It seems we've got a little bit of a problem here.
Yeah, it says you have a restraining order against you.
That means, legally, I can't sell you a gun.
That doesn't mean you have to leave here without protection.
-
- Louis:
Nothing!
- Wendy:
Come on!
Go ahead-- swing!
Guy's got no swing!
He's got nothing!
No batter!
No batter!
This guy can't hit!
What's the matter with you, kid?
Come on, put some weight behind it!
Guy's got no swing!
He's got nothing!
Come on, nervous nellie!
Afraid to take a swing, aren't you, baby?
Smoke that turkey!
Smoke him!
He's got nothing!
No batter!
No batter!
He's got nothing!
The kid's got nothing!
Let's go!
Nervous nellie nellie!
No batter!
Hey, batter batter batter!
No batter!
Swing, batter!
- - careful, kid.
- He's throwing smoke today.
No batter batter batter.
No batter!
No batter!
Nothing!
Guy's got no swing!
He's got nothing!
Smoke that turkey!
Smoke him!
- He's got nothing!
Nervous nellie,
Afraid to take a swing?
Hey, batter batter!
No batter!
Swing, batter!
- He's got nothing!
- -
Did you see that, man?
Oh my god.
I smacked it.
Jerilee, this script of yours--
It's incredible, poetic.
I don't know.
It's got...
Balls.
Mmm.
You really think so?
Are they as big as yours?
Bigger. -
Cut.
- Great.
Great. -
- Yeah, it was okay?
- Absolutely.
Absolutely.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's the kind of chemistry I'm looking for.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming down, david.
I really needed to see the two of you together.
I enjoyed it.
Look, I love this script
And I'd like to do the film.
- Just let me know, bauer.
- I'll be calling the studios.
- We'll make this happen.
- Beautiful.
Let's talk, okay?
I don't know-- maybe get together and discuss our characters.
- Sure, that would be great.
- Oh, that does sound great.
- Jimmy?
- This is a closed set.
The door was open.
I thought I'd stop by, see how it was going.
- What's the big deal?
- Hey, I'll see you later.
- Thanks for coming down.
- You've got it.
Bye.
I know you don't need my advice,
But that guy-- complete shit in his last flick.
Seriously.
Hamming it up all over the place--
All of that.
- Jimmy, get the fuck out of here.
Whoa.
What?
We're almost done here, jimmy.
I'll be out in five minutes, okay?
- Jimmy?
Five minutes.
- Fine, five minutes.
I'm not a fucking chauffeur.
I told you I didn't want that guy anywhere near me.
Bauer, he swears he didn't do it.
Your jealous boyfriend drops you off at my house
On the exact same night that my car gets the shit keyed out of it
And you expect me to believe those two events are not related?
The guy's a fucking parasite.
You know how many times I've heard that before?
Well, then maybe you should start listening.
There's a lot riding on this.
You're the one that stands to lose everything here, inez, not jimmy.
Listen.
You are such a beautiful girl,
Full of promise.
Do you realize you could have just about anything you want?
He's a disease and if you let him,
He's gonna ruin you.
A fucking football stadium.
I guess it will be eventually, yeah.
It doesn't look like this thomas guy has made much progress, though.
Nah.
Life was a lot less complicated
When this was my goal.
Oh, boy.
I get why we're here.
- You do, huh?
- Yeah.
Byzantium's a go.
Tomorrow night's the big celebration
Where people will get their first glimpse at your new city.
And?
And you're feeling a little overwhelmed.
It's understandable.
It's a heavy fucking weight, pal.
There's an urge, kenny-- we all have it--
To be safe, to do less than we can,
To avoid the heavy challenges
And settle for the small victories.
For most of us, maybe.
Not for you.
Somehow, the idea of building a city
Seemed a hell of a lot easier when I had god whispering in my ear.
Maybe he's decided to be a silent partner on this one, huh?
Don't forget--
You're the one that pushed this thing through.
Nobody else.
It's gonna be hard to get it done.
You're just figuring that out now?
Look, you started this thing and,
No matter how difficult it may be,
You're gonna finish it.
You're a confident little fuck, aren't you?
I just know a sure thing when I see one.
Besides, if you even think about quitting,
I'll kick your ass.
So what are we gonna do?
Are we gonna dick around here all day or what?
I hear there's a great party happening downtown.
- - come on.
Pizza's here!
Come on, inez.
You know I can't stand it when you ignore me.
I told you bauer's having a dinner party
And he wants me there.
Yeah, well, I want you here.
Can I ask why I'm not invited to this thing?
Um, I think it might be because you keyed
His $100,000 car, jimmy.
What?
I didn't do shit to his car.
So typical-- deny deny deny.
It wasn't you.
Of course it wasn't you.
It's not obvious at all it was you.
All right, I did it.
I did it, okay?
It was impulsive.
This whole thing is just breaking my heart now.
It's making me fucking crazy.
I have to go, jimmy,
And you have some time to yourself to figure things out.
Baby, wait.
Don't you get why I'm so fucked up over this?
I pushed this thing with bauer.
I made this whole thing happen and now--
What?
Jimmy, no.
I'm the one who's fighting for this,
I'm the one who's going to acting classes
And it's my quality they want.
Your quality?
What is that shit?
Come on, inez.
That's not you talking anymore.
It's bauer.
He's trying to ruin us.
Don't you see that?
Jimmy!
- You just want to let this guy take away everything.
He's inside your head.
You're not seeing us.
You're not seeing me the way you used to.
- Jimmy!
shut the fuck up.
Inez?
Don't be here when I get home.
There you go.
$750, cash as requested.
Thank you.
It's a good truck.
- -
You don't have to do this.
Neither do you.
Uh-oh.
Where are you going?
Where do you think?
Hold on.
Hey.
I want to run something past you.
Aww. -
You're not gonna start in on that whole bondage thing again, are you?
You always use that against me.
Jesus christ, I only mentioned it one time.
So can I get back to what I was about to do?
Would you just look at me for a second?
You're a very handsome man.
Well, that's very kind, but it's not the point.
You don't notice anything different?
Did you get another tattoo?
You're cute and you're funny,
But you might need your fucking eyes examined.
- What is that?
- What does it look like?
Holy shit.
Uh...
Where's this coming from?
Tess, I love you.
Okay, I'm in love with you,
You're in love with me
And we're so fucking good together.
Yes, we are.
We-- we've just never talked about this.
But you're the one that's always saying
That talk is overrated, you know?
Sweetheart,
I'm being pretty romantic here.
Very romantic.
It's just...
A big decision that I haven't even thought about.
Okay.
Let's talk about it then.
Let's have the talk.
That's just it, kenny.
I've not even ready to have the talk,
Let alone think about marriage.
You know what?
You're right.
You're right.
Forget about it.
It's...
A bad fucking idea.
- Stop.
- It's-- please don't shut down on me.
I'm not shutting down.
I'll let you tie me up.
Yeah.
Turn around.
Wow.
Look who's here.
Reliving scenes from childhood?
Is this good manners in south central?
How far are you willing to go, anthony?
I'll let you know when I get there.
Mr. Cendars.
Ah.
Do you have my things?
We do.
They were checked in when you were admitted.
- Can you get them for me, please?
- I can.
I need you to sign these release forms before you go.
All right.
Nurse, my young friend--
The one that brought me in her e- have you seen him?
No, I haven't.
I'm sorry.
She's-- yeah.
Watch your glass. -
- Inez.
Come here.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
This is paolo ferzetti, a brilliant composer.
If you love a film score, it's more than likely that he wrote it.
Of course.
It's an honor to meet you.
Bauer has told me wonderful things about you.
And as fantastic a liar as I am,
I must confess that in your case
I mostly told him the truth.
I'm flattered.
It's really nice to meet you.
I'm sorry.
Would you excuse me for a second?
Sure.
- Hello, david.
- Hi, gorgeous.
- How are you?
God damn it.
Jimmy, don't do it.
See, inez?
His car doesn't mean shit.
None of this means shit except for you and me.
Oh my god, jimmy.
What the hell are you doing?
Jimmy, no!
I'll fucking kill him!
-
Somebody call 911!
Call 911!
Hey, bauer.
Come on, take it easy, man.
Come on.
Relax.
Do it.
Kill me.
You took the only thing that matters to me, anyway!
I love you, inez!
âTª always is always forever âTª âTª is one is one is one âTª âTª always is always forever... âTª
- Shut the fuck up.
- âTª is one is... âTª
All right, now who's gonna talk?
'cause I've got all night
And I ain't leaving till I get answers.
You like having power, don't you, anthony?
No, this ain't got shit to do with me.
You killed ben's daughter.
- Now you've got to own up to it.
- Women:
Ooh.
Accusing us doesn't give you power, anthony.
You don't have power until you actually do something.
- Women:
Do it.
Do it.
- Do it.
- Do it.
If you're such a badass, malcolm, man up--
Own up to cassie's murder.
You know I wanted her dead.
She died.
You make the connection.
- Is that a confession?
That ain't enough.
Say the words.
I'm not afraid of dying for a cause, anthony.
Death is just another river to cross.
Oh yeah.
- If you're the captain, it's fine by me.
Okay.
Okay.
How about them?
Are they ready to cross the river with you?
- Uh-huh!
- All aboard.
- - tracy:
Please, no.
Please, no.
No.
Please, no.
Fuck him.
Black bastard.
I dare you.
Pull the trigger.
I dare you.
she dared you.
I admit your loyalty to ben is admirable.
Yeah, like a loyal fucking slave.
Tell me something--
Was it the lash that made you so loyal
And obedient, boy?
Or was it ben's cock in your ass?
- - ooh!
Nobody else here.
I found these.
- Oops. -
Ben, it's me.
I'm not letting them get away with what they did to cassie and you.
I'll deal with malcolm now.
No more bullshit.
- - rodriguez:
Mr. Cendars.
Excuse me,
May I have a word with you, please?
Is the gun you used to kill cassie in there, asshole?
'cause if it is, you're fucked.
is the gun in there?
You're fucked.
Is the gun in there?
You're fucked.
- Is the gun in there?
You're fucked.
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
Just shut up!
- Oh, shut up.
That gun's just like your dic k- it's never gonna see any action.
I bet their guns aren't even loaded.
- - no, they're loaded.
Uhm, gavin--
That's your name, right?
--Why is it every ofay piece of shit like you,
You love to talk about a brother's dick?
It gets tiring.
I don't wanna hear another goddamn word from any of y'all
Unless you're confessing to the murder of cassie cendars.
Aim that gun at me and pull the trigger.
You're here for a reason,
But it has nothing to do with cassie or ben cendars.
You're here to do what I need done,
Like slaves.
Destiny.
Keep up that slave talk and I'm gonna shove this gun right up your ass.
- you need to do better than that.
You can pull the trigger and we can be martyrs.
Charlie wanted a race war, but he was the wrong man.
Maybe it was just the wrong time,
- But tonight we can make him a prophet.
So helter skelter, my black brothers,
Make his dream come true.
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Woman #2:
Do it.
Fuck!
- You're out of your fucking mind!
- God damn it!
How much reason does a nigger need to kill a white man anyway?
How about this?
One of the guns in that box--
Gavin and I used it just last week.
We killed two of your black brothers--
One in watts, one in crenshaw.
Oh.
oh no.
What did you just say?
It was just another drive-by.
- Woman #2:
Sorry.
We asked the first one for directions.
He walked right up. -
On Tuesday afternoon, off crenshaw,
We shot another one off a bicycle
He probably stole.
I heard about that boy.
Please no.
You.
Did you know about tjis?
Not until after.
You motherfucking son of a bitch!
- - yeah.
- Anthony!
- Yeah.
You wanted a murder confession, you got one.
- we are not gonna do
Anything this white trash tells us to do
Just because we would enjoy it.
He's right, anthony.
What are you doing here, ben?
- I got your message.
The police caught the guy that killed my daughter.
What the fuck are you talking about?
It's malcolm and these people-- they did it.
No, they didn't.
They have evidence, they have a confession.
It has nothing to do with these freaks, anthony.
Yeah, but they've still got blood all over their hands.
- Yeah.
- That doesn't surprise me.
What's the game, malcolm?
Why did you put me through all this?
You actually thought you could solve your daughter's murder, ben?
You're vain.
You're way too vain.
You deserve to be fucked with.
But just because we didn't kill his precious daughter
Doesn't mean you can't do your niÃ§ger duty,
So fucking do it!
We're done here.
I don't have to listen to any more of that shit.
- You use the word "dream" a lot.
- Yeah, I like that word.
- I think it fits.
- Okay.
You also say "imagine" quite a few times.
Yeah, I do, don't I?
Seth, do you really want me to give you notes on this speech?
Yes, definitely.
I mean, I asked you, didn't I?
Tess, the computer guys are here
To set up the presentation for tonight.
Yeah, tell them I'll be there in a second.
- You've got it.
Everything, uh...
Okay?
- How about you let me give you notes on this speech
And then I'll tell you about my love life?
- Fair enough.
Hey, seth?
Seth, I'm leaving.
I'll be there in a minute, baby.
Okay, I like this cut right there.
It's good.
Yeah, me too.
- Okay, I have to go out for a bit.
You and battaglia play nice.
Hey, you know what?
You have so much going on.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Absolutely.
This is important.
Come on.
He was arrested on burglary charges.
He's got a sheet a mile long--
Possession, robbery, assault.
We found a weapon on him.
Ballistics match the weapon
To the one used in your daughter's murder.
He gave us a full confession--
As much as he can remember.
So what did he say?
Did he know cassie?
- Why did he do it?
- He's an addict.
He's got a history of mental illness.
He had a reason.
He's forgotten what it was.
Mr. Cendars, when you came to me months ago
Asking about your daughter's murder,
You put her case back on the radar.
Every time a weapon came in,
I ran a ballistics profile.
I would've never done that if you hadn't pushed so hard.
So, umm...
What about me and my uncle?
I'm gonna pretend you didn't ask that.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a group of murder suspects to process.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's go.
Come on.
- Here you go, baby.
- Seth, I'm not an invalid.
You're having our baby.
Let me pamper you.
You must be so bored.
You don't have to stay.
I want to stay.
- Seriously, this is your last chance.
I'll remember you told me so.
- I love you, seth.
- I love me too.
Okay, everybody, the break's over.
All right, if everybody is set,
We'll pick up where we left off.
Let's get things rolling.
Who wants to start?
- me.
- Okay, you have the floor.
Hi, I'm maggie.
I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, maggie.
hi, maggie.
Hey, it's me.
I've got one call and you're it.
I'm really sorry, inez.
I just didn't know how else to get through to you.
It was the only way I could think of
To show you how I was feeling.
It was stupid.
I-
- I'm stupid.
Anyway, I want to be able to tell you all this in person.
If you could find it in your heart to come bail me out--
I love you, baby.
Don't worry.
It's not like you have to give a speech or anything.
Seth will introduce you at the beginning of the evening.
He'll hand you a nice plaque commemorating
Your outstanding service to the cause.
You'll say a few brief words,
And after that it's party time.
- Sound good?
- It sounds wonderful.
I-
- I just can't believe it.
I mean, I understand honoring louis--
He has done so much-- but to pick me?
I mean there has to be so many other volunteers more deserving.
Well, seth must think otherwise.
He chose you personally.
Now things kick off around 8:00.
We probably need you here around 7:30.
- Any questions?
- Don't think so.
Great.
I'll see you tonight.
well, this is gonna be one hell of a night.
- - oh.
It's bo. -
Bo?
I have been so worried.
Where are you?
Bo!
Oh.
Mom, don't.
Okay?
There's no need.
Okay.
You listen here, young man.
We need to have a serious talk
- About your recent behavior.
- I understand, okay?
But not here, not now.
I'm still very unhappy with you.
I get it.
Mr. Eigenberg, please accept my apology, sir.
What I did-- putting my hands on you like that--
There's just no excuse.
I agree.
I hope I didn't hurt you.
No, but you should really get a handle on that temper of yours.
Yeah, you're right about that, sir.
Your mother's getting an award tonight.
No kidding?
That's great.
You deserve it.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Oh, bo, it would be so great if you could come.
This is a very important night for me
And I want you to be part of it.
Okay, you've got me.
Fantastic.
Kenny!
- Yeah?
- Wendy:
Look who's here.
I appreciate it.
Hey, bo.
I didn't expect to see you around here anytime soon.
Bo's gonna be my guest at the gala tonight.
- Oh, is that a fact?
- Mm-hmm.
I thought you weren't a big fan of byzantium.
Well, I'm a big fan of my mom's and I'd like to support her.
Sure, that makes sense.
Well, congratulations again, wendy.
- Thank you.
Bo, I'll check you later.
Sir.
Well, I guess I should get going too.
Is-- is there a restroom that I can use?
- Oh, back-- - oh, perfect.
Hey, don't leave without saying goodbye.
I won't.
He really is a good boy at heart.
Jimmy killed bobby sabian may 17th?
Why am I just now hearing about it?
I know I should've come forward sooner,
But I was scared.
I mean, he warned me that if I ever told anyone
He killed bobby sabian, he would do--
He would do the same thing to me,
And I believed him.
I mean, jimmy's right in here now
On arson charges.
He's clearly dangerous.
Well, I appreciate you coming in, miss heredia.
We'll certainly look into your claims,
But without any physical evidence,
It's a tough road.
Jimmy gave me this money the night he told me what happened.
Bobby's blood is all over it.
Thinking about jumping?
Huh.
Since when are you a fucking mind-reader?
Since I talked to your girlfriend.
She told you?
- That's nice.
- I could tell something was up.
- Mm-hmm?
- You've got a lousy poker face.
Well, I guess I just moved in too soon...
Too fast,
Pouted like an infant, you know?
- Stop me when you disagree.
- I'll let you know.
Oh, seth, I'm an insensitive prick.
Tess and I, what we've got--
It's different.
You know, it's nice.
I'm an idiot for rushing in.
I should've fucking known better.
But I guess I'm starting to realize I may be a little insecure.
She might be the love of my fucking life, you know?
If she asked me to wait, I should wait, right?
You're right.
Man, I'm embarrassed.
I'm actually embarrassed.
I owe that poor woman an apology.
You're a pal.
Thank you.
Glad I could help.
It's unfortunate is what it is, jimmy.
Bobby's case was ice cold.
Lowlifes like that--
Not a high priority.
And then your girlfriend pays me a visit and--
Well...
She must be a real bitch.
I always said that girl's got what it takes.
She's gonna be in a big movie, you know--
A remake of "the lonely lady."
Never heard of it.
Wait.
The pia zadora titty flick?
That thing was a piece of shit.
Yeah, well...
This one's gonna be better.
- Hey, nolanski,
- You got a second?
- Tess:
Sure.
- Come here. - all right.
Hear me out, will you?
So I've given this a little though
And I think we've got to slow things down a little here, all right?
It's all happening way too fast.
I'm getting a uncomfortable.
So I'm thinking we should take a breath,
You know, get our bearings.
Maybe then we could continue on
At exactly the same pace as before.
- Really?
- Yeah, afraid so.
You know, we should take a little time or--
I don't know-- a medium amount of time,
You know, before we...
Become mature
- And kick this up to the next level.
- Yeah, sure.
Okay.
I'm sorry if that's offensive, but you know what?
That's the way it's gotta be.
- I can live with that.
- You can, huh?
Good.
Good.
I'm glad we see eye to eye.
Just, umm...
Make sure you don't lose that ring.
Not a chance.
I've gotta get back to work.
Me too.
Go get 'em.
Hey.
That's a nice dress.
It's about time you noticed.
- Could you get this for me?
- Yeah.
Well...
Here we are.
I am so proud of you,
And you are a great man.
- I just have a lot of money.
- Don't do that.
Don't downplay this moment.
I can be proud of you if I want to be.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Snazzy.
Oh.
- Very nice.
- You are so beautiful.
Knock-knock.
- Mmm.
- Hi.
- Are you ready to roll, boss?
- I am.
You look fetching as always, mrs.
B.
And you, you handsome devil,
Look almost presentable.
That's what I was going for.
Let's go get 'em.
dr.
Smith, how totally cool to see you.
- You know my wife maggie.
- Yes, how are you?
Hello, andrea.
Good to see you.
Louis!
Wendy!
Oh, I'm so glad that both of you could make it.
Oh, thank you.
Oh.
- - maggie, I want you to meet
Louis eigenberg and wendy olinville,
Two outstanding volunteers
We'll be honoring later tonight.
Thank you so much for all your help.
We really appreciate it.
Oh, it's nothing.
I mean, all this fuss isn't necessary.
I was happy just to help out.
I for one don't mind the fuss at all.
- Oh, stop it.
- Is your son gonna be here tonight?
- I invited him,
- But I haven't seen him anywhere.
- He's still got time.
We're not getting started for another, oh, 15 minutes or so.
Seth, sorry to interrupt.
Joseph watanabe would like to say hello.
Right.
Congratulations again to the both of you.
Thanks for coming, wendy.
It was really nice to meet you.
Thanks again.
He's such a handsome man.
I wonder where that son of mine is.
Here, that's your--
That's your severance pay.
- No no, that's-- - go on.
- Oh, ben.
- No amount of money can cover
What I owe you, all right?
Yeah.
So...
Is that it?
Are we done?
You mean-- well, you don't work for me anymore, anthony.
I mean, you're part of my life.
I hope you want me to be a part of yours.
Of course I do, but are you okay?
You seem to be at peace with everything.
You know, when I was staring at cassie's killer,
I realized something, anthony.
Even if I killed him,
It wouldn't make me feel any better
About cassie and the way I let her down.
I mean, my past is what it is.
I can't change the mistakes that I made
And I was so vain that I thought I could.
That demented fuck malcolm
Was right about that.
Wow, you came close, didn't you?
To blowing him away, man.
Yeah, I got caught up in his madness.
Spewing all that shit, all that hate--
You know, it got to me.
I hated him.
I was in a dark place, man.
I wanted him dead.
Yeah, well, I helped put you there.
I...
Pulled you down
Into my darkness.
So what are you gonna do now?
Me?
Oh, I know exactly what I'm gonna do now, anthony,
Because I know where I belong now...
Finally.
They call los angeles the city of dreams,
The city of tomorrow, a city of hope,
Of possibility, of new beginnings
And ultimate visions.
Now when most people hear the words
"los angeles" and "dreams,"
They think about becoming a movie star,
A celebrity, of acquiring riches and fame.
But I'm not thinking about that individual dream
Of wealth and power, no.
I devoted my whole life to attaining those things
And I can stand right here and tell you right now
That those things
Are not enough.
Those things do not hold.
There has to be something more.
Tonight we've come together
To share a common dream,
One that unites us.
We're here because we dare to imagine
A different los angeles,
A city of decent homes for all its citizens,
Especially those who've made do with far too little
For far too long.
That is our challenge--
To find out if we're still capable
Of making that dream a reality.
Now there are those who insist that byzantium will never be built...
Ooh.
...That it can't be built.
Just turn on your tv.
- It's full of politicians- -
- Is something wrong?
- No.
Just admiring your lack of remorse.
You mean jimmy.
I had no choice.
- It had to be done.
- I completely agree.
Our worst critics say that even if we can build it,
Byzantium is doomed
- To fail.
- Man:
No, it's not!
- Woman:
It's not.
They seem to believe,
Although they won't come out and say it,
That the homeless
Are somehow less than human,
That their suffering and our indifference
Are the natural order of things.
Well, I believe these critics are wrong.
They are wrong and we--
You, me-- we have the opportunity here tonight
To prove it.
Is it going to be easy?
I asked you a question.
- Is it going to be easy?
No.
Hell no.
But are we gonna get it done?
Hell yes!
There you are.
- You missed my big moment.
- I'm sorry, mom.
- That's a nice plaque.
- I think I'll hang it up
In the store right next to your trophies.
Yeah, that's fine.
I'm so glad you could come, son,
- To be with me.
- Me too.
...But a second chance at life.
Imagine living in that kind of city.
Imagine our kids living in that kind of city.
That's the challenge we've accepted.
A wise man once said
"all that you take with you
Is what you leave behind."
Well, I believe together
We can leave behind a new beginning,
A new vision for los angeles.
They call los angeles the city of dreams,
The city of tomorrow.
Well, this is our chance to prove it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you byzantium.
Come on, bo.
Let's get closer.
Come here.
All right, joey, get catering to bring food out.
- I want to break this crowd up.
- That was so good.
- Are you happy?
- Real happy.
Congratulations.
- Are you okay, baby?
- It's a little bit tight.
- Kenny, get her out of this crowd.
- All right.
What about you?
- Are you done yet?
All right.
- Don't spoil my fun.
- I'm gonna take her back here.
- You've got it.
Tell joey I need another shirt.
This is soaked through.
- Kenny:
We're on it.
Good to see you, pal.
Copy that.
- Maggie:
Oh my god!
- Call the paramedics, for christ's sake!
Hey hey hey hey!
Seth.
Seth.
Can you see what happened?
Is seth okay?
Seth.
Seth, stay with me.
Hey, buddy.
Hey. -
No.
- Oh, fuck.
- Maggie:
Oh my god.
- Come here.
- No.
Oh my god.
Oh my god!
This is a horrible tragedy,
A terrible loss for all of us.
I mean, we've both been big supporters
Of seth blanchard ever since he first announced
His plans to build byzantium.
Isn't that right?
Seth blanchard was a great great man.
He was my hero.
I'm sorry.
Can we get your name?
Inez heredia.
I'm anctress.
I've got an idea, unc.
Let's get out of l.A. For a little while,
Close up shop for a week or two.
Just me and you?
Yeah, a trip...
On me.
I've got some money.
I'll spend some on the trip
And you can help me figure out what to do with the rest.
Me and you-- first class.
Well, okay.
If you really want my help with your money,
First thing we're gonna do-- fly coach.
There have been a lot of rumors flying around
As to whether or not byzantium will move forward.
Well, I am here to tell you
That I intend to honor my husband's dream
Of making his city for the homeless a reality.
Byzantium will be built.
I'm back.
I can see that.
Welcome home, ben.
Yeah.
MAN:
One of the last jobs I had in Yellowstone was delivering the mail on snowmobile.
There I was in the world's first national park, and I remember going down into Hayden Valley.
There were bison crossing over the road... 2,000-pound mammals crossing over the road, and it was so cold.
It was about 60 below zero.
And the bison, as they breathed, their exhalation would seem to crystallize in the air around them, and there were these sheets, these ropey stands of crystals kind of flowing down from their breath.
And I saw them, and they just moved their heads and were looking at me, and I remember thinking that if I had not been on that machine, I would have thought I had been thrust fully back into the Pleistocene, back into
the Ice Age.
And I remember just stopping and turning it off because the only way you could hear was to turn that thing off, and I would turn it off, and I would listen, and I felt like this was the first day... and this morning was the first time the sun had ever come up
and the shadows that are being cast right now is the first time those shadows have ever been cast on the earth.
And I was all alone, but I felt I was in the presence of everything around me and I was never alone.
It was one of those moments when you get pulled outside of yourself into the environment around you, and I felt like I was just with the breath of the bison as they were exhaling and I was exhaling and they
were inhaling.
It was all kind of flowing together, and I forgot completely about the mail.
All I was thinking of was that a single moment in a place as wild as Yellowstone, and most of the national parks, can last forever.
PETER COYOTE:
In 1883, a young politician, the second son of a prominent New York City family, became alarmed about reports that the vast herds of buffalo that had once blanketed the Great Plains were quickly disappearing.
So he hurried west on the Northern Pacific Railroad and got off when he reached the heart of the badlands in the Dakota territory.
[Train whistle blows]
His name was Theodore Roosevelt.
He was 24 years old, and he was afraid the buffalo would become extinct before he got the chance to shoot one.
He hired a local guide and endured days of rough travel by horseback until he finally came across a solitary buffalo bull, killed it, and then removed its head for shipment back to New York to be mounted on his wall.
MAN:
Roosevelt loved to kill.
He liked to shoot quadrupeds.
At times he basically said he didn't trust Americans who wouldn't hunt, and he hinted that he didn't believe that
Americans should have citizenship who weren't willing to kill a quadruped.
COYOTE:
That first trip to the west, Roosevelt said later, was an important turning point for him.
Over the next several years, he would return again and again to take more hunting trips into the mountains, to ranch on the open plains, to build up his health and character by pursuing what he called "the strenuous life,"
to become, in his own words, "at heart as much a Westerner as I am an Easterner."
Roosevelt would never lose his love of hunting, but in time he would learn that there were much bigger and more important trophies to pursue.
[Roaring]
WOMAN:
Our national parks are an idea, an idea based on generosity... not just for our own species, but for all species.
I think that is profoundly original in terms of a people that say, we value wild nature in place.
We are of this place.
And I think it's our own declaration of both independence and interdependence.
MAN:
The great wilds of our country, once held to be boundless and inexhaustible, are being rapidly invaded and overrun in every direction, and everything destructible in them is being destroyed.
How far destruction may go is not easy to guess.
Every landscape, low and high, seems doomed to be trampled and harried.
John Muir.
COYOTE:
As the 19th century entered its final decade,
Americans began to take stock of what they had made of the continent they had been so busily subduing.
Only 50 years earlier, the nation's western border had been the spine of the Rocky Mountains.
Buffalo numbering in the tens of millions teemed on the Great Plains.
Vast forests had never heard the ring of an ax.
Indian peoples stilled controlled most of the west.
[Train whistle blowing]
Now the nation stretched all the way to the Pacific.
Railroads had pushed into every corner of the country.
Indians had been systematically dispossessed from their homelands and forced onto reservations.
White settlements had sprung up in so many places that the director of the census of 1890 announced he could no longer find an American frontier.
The bountiful land Thomas Jefferson considered nature's nation had seemingly been conquered.
MAN:
The moment that Americans start setting aside these national parks is also the moment of sort of the most explosive exploitation of so many elements of the national landscape.
It's the cutting down of the north woods at an extraordinary rate.
It's the destruction of the bison herds, the elimination of the passenger pigeons.
There is so much being destroyed in the name of progress in the United States in the late 19th century that the parks are a kind of reaction against that.
They are saying, if we keep going the way we're going, we're going to use it all up, and some of this is so beautiful, so essential to who we are as a people that
we've got to put walls around these parts and protect them from ourselves.
COYOTE:
By 1890, the United States has established 4 national parks:
Yellowstone, the world's first; the high country of Yosemite; and two groves of big trees in California-General Grant and Sequoia.
The army had recently been placed in charge of protecting them all.
[Gunshot]
Nonetheless, park wildlife were still routinely killed.
Cows and sheep still overgrazed park meadows.
Ancient forests were still endangered.
And tourists seemed intent on squandering the treasures a previous generation had bequeathed them.
The park idea, not yet a quarter century old, still seemed an uncertain experiment.
The issues of what was permissible and proper for people who visited the parks were still unresolved.
But as a new century was about to dawn, a handful of Americans began to question the headlong rush that had caused so much devastation and saw in the national parks a seed of hope that at least some pristine places could be
saved before it was too late.
Among them would be the young assemblyman from New York City who had gone west on a boyish impulse but who would mature into a president whose most lasting legacy was rescuing large portions of America from destruction.
MAN:
Surely our people do not understand even yet the rich heritage that is theirs.
There can be nothing in the world more beautiful than the Yosemite, the groves of giant sequoias and redwoods, the canyon of the Yellowstone, the canyon of the Colorado, the Three Tetons.
And our people should see to it that they are preserved for their children and their children's children forever with their majestic beauty all unmarred.
DIFFERENT MAN:
Dear reader, today I'm in the Yellowstone Park, and I wish I were dead.
The park is just a howling wilderness of 3,000 square miles, full of all imaginable freaks of a fiery nature.
I have been through the park in a buggy in the company of an adventurous old lady from Chicago and her husband, who disapproved of the scenery as being ungodly.
I fancy it scared them.
Rudyard Kipling.
COYOTE:
In 1889, Rudyard Kipling, a young Englishman and aspiring writer, was making his first tour of the United States, financing the trip by writing dispatches for newspapers overseas.
Like many foreigners, Kipling could not resist stopping at Yellowstone, a place already known around the world as the wonderland.
Most visitors in those days were well-to-do, able to pay the $120 train fare across the continent to the remote northwestern corner of Wyoming and then $40 more for the 5-day stagecoach trip through the park known as
the grand tour.
The first stop was the hotel at Mammoth Hot Springs, where everyone unpacked quickly and then rushed to buy souvenirs and post cards made by the park's resident photographer, Frank J. Haynes.
Many guests were perfectly content to view the Mammoth
Springs from the comfort of the hotel veranda, but some bought guide books and hiked up to the terraces for a closer look.
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING:
I found a basin which some learned hotel-keeper has christened Cleopatra's Pitcher or Mark Antony's Whiskey Jug or something equally poetical.
I do not know the depth of that wonder.
The eye looked down into an abyss that communicated directly with the central fires of the earth.
The ground rings hollow as a kerosene tin, and someday the
Mammoth Hotel, guests and all, will sink into the caverns below and be turned into a stalactite.
COYOTE:
In the morning, the passengers loaded back into their assigned carriages and one by one set off toward the park's interior, spaced about every 500 yards to lessen the effects of dust that clung in the air, Kipling
wrote, as dense as a fog.
He was bemused by his fellow tourists, especially the older woman from Chicago sitting next to him, who chewed gum and talked constantly, pontificating with her husband on everything they encountered, especially once they reached the first geyser area.
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING:
The old lady, regarding the horrors of the fire holes, could only say "Good Lord!"
at 30-second intervals.
Her husband talked about the dreadful waste of steam power.
"And if," continued the old lady, "if we find a thing"
"so dreadful as all that steam and sulfur allowed on the face"
"on the earth, mustn't we believe there is something"
"10,000 times more terrible below,"
"prepared for our destruction?"
COYOTE:
At noon, they stopped at a tent hotel, a place called Larry's, run by Larry Matthews, a friendly and loquacious Irishman known for lavishing special attention on his gentille guests.
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING:
Larry enveloped us all in the golden glamor of his speech, 'ere we had descended.
And the tent with the rude trestle table became a palace, the rough fare became delicacies of Delmonico's, and we, the abashed recipients of Larry's imperial bounty.
It was only later that I discovered that I had paid 8 shillings for tinned beef, biscuits, and beer.
COYOTE:
Like the other establishments within the park, Larry's encouraged tourists to believe that all the water in Yellowstone was impregnated with sulfur and therefore unfit for drinking.
It was untrue, but it boosted sales of mineral water and beer at the inflated price of 50 cents a bottle and created roadsides littered with empties.
When the parade of stagecoaches reached the lower geyser basin, the tourists encamped for two nights at the Fire Hole Hotel, or later, the more luxurious
Fountain Hotel, built at a cost of $100,000 and capable of handling 350 guests, complete with electric lights, steam heat, and hot baths fed by one of the thermal springs.
The next two days of the grand tour were devoted exclusively to visiting the spectacular array of geysers and thermal pools and fumaroles, the largest concentration of them in the world.
Tourists would peer down the throat of gaping holes in the ground, taking their chances that a geyser was not about to erupt in their face.
They marveled at the beauty of translucent pools of turquoise water, washed pieces of linen in Handkerchief Pool, which turned the cloth white as snow.
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING:
They are guarded by soldiers who patrol with loaded six-shooters in order that the tourists may not bring up fence-rails and sink them in a pool or chip the fretted tracery of the formations with a geological hammer or, walking where the crust is too
thin, foolishly cook himself.
COYOTE:
No visit to Yellowstone was considered complete without seeing Old Faithful go off on schedule.
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING:
All the young ladies remarked that it was elegant and betook themselves to writing their names in the bottoms of shallow pools.
Nature fixes the insult indelibly, and the after-years will learn that Hattie, Sadie, Marnie, Sophie, and so forth have taken out their hairpins and scrawled in the face of Old Faithful.
COYOTE:
The last night in the park was spent at a hotel near the majestic Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.
The view from its edge was considered the inspirational grand finale.
Even the cynical Rudyard Kipling was impressed.
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING:
All I can say is that without warning or preparation, I looked into a gulf 1,700 feet deep with eagles and fish hawks circling far below, and the sides of that gulf were one wild welter of colon-crimson, emerald, cobalt, ocher, amber, honey
splashed with port wine, snow white, vermillion, lemon, and silver-gray in wide washes.
So far below that no sound of its strife could reach us, the Yellowstone River ran, a finger-wide strip of jade green.
Now I know what it is to sit enthroned amid the clouds of sunset.
COYOTE:
The final day consisted of a stagecoach ride back to the start of the tour, lunch once more at Larry's, shouting out the names of their home states and countries to passing wagons filled with fresh loads of tourists heading into the park, dinner at the hotel
at Mammoth Hot Springs, then on to the train waiting at the station to carry them and their memories away.
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING: "And to think," said the old lady from Chicago, "that this showplace has been going"
"on all these days, and none of we ever saw it."
Rudyard Kipling.
MAN:
Those first few years... and maybe this was OK because there were so few visitors... but it was just wide open.
Those early visitors trying to figure out how best to enjoy
Yellowstone were very quickly teaching the managers what wasn't gonna work.
Nobody knew how to act in a national park.
It hadn't been decided yet.
COYOTE:
Having created the national parks, Congress had not seen fit to provide some kind of authority to oversee them, and in 1886, it even refused to appropriate any money whatsoever.
General Phillip Sheridan had been forced to send the U.S.
Cavalry into Yellowstone simply to maintain some semblance of order.
By the 1890s, this temporary arrangement had become permanent.
Up to 4 troops of cavalry were stationed at the newly constructed Fort Yellowstone near the Mammoth Hot Springs.
SCHULLERY:
I think the odds are really good that if the army hadn't been sent in, Yellowstone wouldn't have made it.
Writing your name on things was such a proud tradition that people would put their address, too, and the soldiers could just very simply go out and write them all down, head back to the hotel, and look through the hotel
registers and find these people and drag them by the collar back out so they could spend some time scrubbing their name off.
COYOTE:
The army was expected to patrol 2 million acres on horseback, doing their best to stop poachers and vandals and campers careless with their fires.
But the troopers were hampered by the fact that the federal park existed in a legal no man's land.
Usually their only recourse was a warning, or in the most serious cases, expulsion from the park.
Army engineers built and improved the roads and bridges that guided travel within the park to the places tourists wanted to see, while leaving major portions of Yellowstone a road-less and totally wild expanse.
With the tourists gone, the cavalrymen found themselves holed up in small cabins scattered around the park, patrolling for poachers on skis in frigid temperatures and lethal snowstorms.
Frederick Remington, when he visited and traveled with the soldiers in Yellowstone, said that they were very fond of saying that Yellowstone had 3 seasons:
July, August, and winter, and they hated it.
COYOTE:
Men were lost transporting mail from one isolated outpost to another.
They died in avalanches.
Some may have been killed by poachers, who were often better equipped and more experienced at maneuvering through the back country in deep snow.
MAN:
In my last report, I noted the death of Private
Matthews of Troop B, 6th Cavalry, while on detached service for the mail.
A most thorough search for his remains was continued for almost 6 months after his disappearance.
His body was found early in June.
It was evident that he became lost and while in that condition became crazed and perished from the cold.
Captain George Anderson.
COYOTE:
The cavalry was also in charge of the nation's 3 other national parks...
General Grant, Sequoia, and the high country surrounding Yosemite.
Each spring, troops stationed at the Presidio in San
Francisco would make the 2-week, 250-mile ride to the
Sierras and patrol the 3 parks during the summer season.
Some of them were African Americans, the celebrated buffalo soldiers of the 9th and 10th Cavalry who had made a name for themselves in the Indian wars.
Their commander was Captain Charles Young, born into slavery in Kentucky, whose father had escaped bondage during the Civil War to enlist in the Union Army.
Young followed his father's example of military service, becoming the third black man to graduate from West Point and the first to be put in charge of a national park.
JOHNSON:
If you're an enlisted man and then you see an African American officer-an officer...
That stays in your mind, and it also sparks a fire in your own sense of self-worth, your own sense of what is possible in this world, because you might say to yourself, "If he could do"
"that, maybe I could do that as well."
So he was a walking inspiration to the enlisted men in the 9th and 10th Cavalry.
COYOTE:
As superintendent of Sequoia, Young directed his men to complete the first wagon road into the Giant Forest.
They accomplished more in one summer than had been done in the 3 previous years combined.
They built the first trail to Mt.
Whitney, the highest peak in the west, and erected fences around the big trees to prevent vandalism by visitors.
JOHNSON:
So the early parks...
Yellowstone, Sequoia, and Yosemite... you had to have park protectors because otherwise, people would be going into those areas doing what they've always done... cutting trees down, you know, for firewood, or shooting the game, shooting
the deer to feed their family.
How do you tell someone who's just trying to keep their children fed, not hungry, that it's illegal now to shoot the game in Yosemite or in Sequoia National Park?
And that would be a difficult proposition if you were a white soldier, but when you add that overlay of race, which is no overlay at all, and you have an African
American, a colored man, giving orders to people who are not used to taking orders from anyone who looks like me, then you have the beginning of a very interesting day.
COYOTE:
Like their counterparts at Yellowstone, the troops in California had to operate without clear legal authority and therefore invented techniques to protect their parks.
When they collected travelers' rifles upon entry and only returned them when the visitors left, the wildlife began to come back.
Sheep herders defiantly bringing their flocks into the park's alpine meadows had been openly scornful of the troops, once they realized that the army had no power of criminal arrest and prosecution.
The soldiers then came up with a creative solution.
JOHNSON:
It was a standard rule.
You find the sheep that are grazing illegally in the park, and you move the sheep out to the eastern boundary of the park.
You find the sheepherders, and you move them out the western boundary of the park.
Now, the park in those days was 1,500 square miles, so by the time the sheep and the sheep herders were reunited, well, let's just say the season was done, and if you have a business and your
business is herding sheep and that happens to you more than once or twice, you don't come back, and I think that was a pretty effective way of dealing with illegal grazing in the park.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
For many years, the military have guarded the great Yellowstone Park, and now they are guarding the Yosemite.
They found it a desert as far as underbrush, grass, and flowers were concerned, but in two years, the skin of the mountains is healthy again.
Blessings on Uncle Sam's soldiers.
They have done their job well, and every pine tree is waving its arm for joy.
COYOTE:
No one was more thankful for the army's presence than John Muir, for whom the Sierra Nevada was the range of light... mountains, he wrote, "that were throbbing"
"and pulsing with the heartbeats of God."
WOMAN:
I think John Muir understood, as perhaps no one else has, how essential beauty is... natural beauty is to us.
Without beauty, we have no, kind of, lubrication of the human spirit.
We would just be dead, and that's really what drove him.
That's what fueled him.
COYOTE:
Clambering ecstatically over the mountainsides, Muir had become a self-taught expert in glaciers, a keen observer and lover of everything he encountered, from the tiniest specks of lichen on a rock to the mighty sequoias.
And through his magazine articles, he had emerged as a wilderness prophet, a nationally known voice for preserving the last remaining vestiges of America's virgin forests and unspoiled lands.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
Mere destroyers... tree killers, wool and mutton men, spreading death and confusion in the fairest groves and gardens ever planted.
Let the government hasten to cast them out and make an end of them.
Any fool can destroy trees.
They cannot run away.
And if they could, they would still be destroyed... chased and hunted down as long as fun or a dollar could be got out of their bark hides.
Through all the wonderful, eventful centuries since
Christ's time and long before that, God has cared for these trees, saved them from drought, disease, avalanches, and a thousand straining, leveling tempests and floods, but he cannot save them from fools.
Only Uncle Sam can do that.
COYOTE:
Yosemite's high country had been designated a national park in 1890, but the valley itself remained under the control of a California state commission and their political appointees, a group of "blundering, plundering, moneymaking vote sellers,"
Muir said.
He wanted it all transferred back to the federal government.
Only then, he believed, would it be safe from ruin.
In 1892, to help promote Yosemite's protection,
Muir and a small group of prominent Californians formed a new organization.
They called it the Sierra Club.
Muir enthusiastically agreed to serve as its president, hoping, he said, that "we will be able to do something"
"for wildness and make the mountains glad."
[Scattered applause]
MAN:
In the 19th century, when the census bureau would do its census, it would draw a line that's the frontier line, and proudly say it marches westward, and their definition of it had this wonderful phrase.
It would say, in the last 10 years, this many million of acres have been "redeemed from wilderness by"
"the hand of man."
"Redeemed from wilderness by the hand of man."
In other words, a virgin forest is redeemed when it's cut down.
A beautiful mountain stream is redeemed when the miners are turned loose in it.
That symbolized what our view of nature was as we were rushing across the continent.
That's totally the opposite of what John Muir would say.
Wilderness isn't redeemed by man.
Man is redeemed by wilderness.
MAN:
To know you are the first to set foot in homes that have been deserted for centuries is a strange feeling.
It is as though unseen eyes watched, wondering what aliens were invading their sanctuaries and why.
The dust of centuries filled the rooms and rose in thick clouds at every movement.
Al Wetherill.
COYOTE:
A few months before Rudyard Kipling visited
Yellowstone, cowboys searching for stray cattle in southwestern Colorado, along the edge of a high plateau known as Mesa Verde, came upon the ruins of an ancient city tucked into the side of a cliff.
Using a tree trunk and their lariats, they improvised a ladder and descended for a closer look.
MAN AS AL WETHERILL:
It was like treading holy ground to go into those peaceful-looking homes of a vanished people.
Things were arranged in the rooms as if people might just have been out visiting somewhere.
COYOTE:
In quick succession, they soon came across even more ruins nestled into the remote canyon walls of Mesa
Verde and gave names to them all.
Cliff Palace.
Spruce Tree House.
Balcony House.
It was the largest concentration ever found of the cliff dwellings... built, occupied, and then mysteriously deserted nearly a thousand years earlier by the ancestors of some of the modern Pueblo Indians of the southwest.
MAN AS AL WETHERILL:
We knew that if we did not break into that charmed world, someone else would sometime... someone who might not love and respect those emblems of antiquity as we did.
COYOTE:
The cowboys who discovered the ruins were the
Wetherills... 5 brothers from a family of Quakers who had moved to Colorado from Kansas 8 years earlier.
The oldest was Richard, who encouraged them all to spend every free moment digging among the ruins, hoping to sell their discoveries to museums in big cities.
MAN AS AL WETHERILL:
We had started in as just ordinary pot-hunters, but as work progressed along that sort of questionable business, we developed quite a bit of scientific knowledge by careful work and comparisons.
COYOTE:
One day a stranger showed up, a young Swedish nobleman with an interest in archeology...
Gustaf Nordenskiold.
When the Wetherills showed him the ruins, his enthusiasm, one of the brothers remembered, increased almost beyond his control.
For two months, from sunup to sundown, he kept the Wetherill brothers busy, teaching them more scientific methods.
He showed them how to use a mason's trowel instead of a spade, digging slowly and carefully to reveal a relic without damaging it.
He insisted on labeling and photographing everything and often saved items that no other archaeologist of the time would have kept...
Wood ash from fire pits, dust and trash from the floors, even dried pieces of human excrement that one day might help determine what the ancient Puebloans had been eating so long ago.
In all, he amassed hundreds of items which he intended to ship home to Sweden.
But when his pack animals, loaded down with artifacts, reached the railway station in Durango, Nordenskiold was immediately arrested.
MAN:
The basic problem was, this foreigner is stealing our relics, our bowls, our pots, and we're not gonna allow that.
It's all right for we Americans to steal them, but it's not all right for those foreigners to do it.
Gustaf's lawyer asked the judge, under what law are we arresting him?
And there was no law.
There was no law at all, so they couldn't stop him.
They couldn't stop anybody, and that probably sparked some interest... why isn't there a law?
COYOTE:
Nordenskiold was released and got to take his huge shipment home to Scandinavia, where he published the first scientific study of the cliff dwellers.
But the controversy had brought worldwide attention to
Mesa Verde and to the fact that its treasures were completely unprotected.
MAN:
We have seen the Indian and the game retreat before the white man and the cattle and beheld the tide of immigration move forward which threatens before long to leave no portion of our vast territory unbroken by the farmer's plow or untrodden by his flocks.
There is one spot left-a single rock about which this tide will break and past which it will sweep, leaving it undefiled by the unsightly traces of civilization.
Here in this Yellowstone Park, the large game of the west may be preserved from extermination in this, their last refuge.
George Bird Grinnell.
COYOTE:
By the 1890s, few Americans understood as keenly as George Bird Grinnell, the editor and owner of "Forest and Stream" magazine, how fearful the price had been for the nation's relentless expansion across the continent.
Raised on the estate of the famous painter and naturalist
John James Audubon at the north end of Manhattan,
Grinnell could remember spotting a bald eagle from his bedroom window and watching immense flocks of passenger pigeons darkening the sky from horizon to horizon as they passed overhead.
Traveling across Kansas, he had once encountered a buffalo herd so vast that his train was forced to stop for 3 hours while the beasts crossed the tracks.
He had hunted elk in Nebraska when elk could still be found on the plains, ridden with the Pawnees in a great buffalo chase as the Indians brought down their prey with bows and arrows.
Now all that and so much more suddenly seemed gone or on the verge of disappearing.
Passenger pigeons had been so systematically killed that a bird once numbering in the hundreds of millions had been reduced to a handful, and soon the death of a solitary bird in a Cincinnati zoo would bring an end to
the species' existence.
The hide-hunters had been equally effective with the buffalo.
By the mid-1880s, the last of the great free-roaming herds had been slaughtered.
Now the only wild herd left in the country was in Yellowstone
National Park, estimated at only a few hundred animals.
MAN AS GEORGE BIRD GRINNELL:
For 4 centuries, we have been killing and marketing game, destroying it as rapidly and as thoroughly as we knew how, and making no provision toward replacing the supply.
We are just beginning to ask one another how we may preserve the little that remains for ourselves and our children.
COYOTE:
Grinnell regularly used the pages of "Forest"
"and Stream" to try to point Americans in a new direction.
It wasn't that he was against hunting.
In fact, he loved to hunt.
Grinnell just feared that without wise management, there would be nothing left for hunters to shoot.
He proposed the creation of a new organization aimed at stopping the heedless killing of wild birds,
"in honor," Grinnell wrote, "of the man who did more to"
"teach Americans about birds of their own land than any other"
"who ever lived."
He named the group The Audubon Society.
And when Grinnell published a mildly critical review of Theodore Roosevelt's book chronicling his own western adventures, the young author burst into Grinnell's office to confront him.
The two men turned the awkward moment into the beginning of a lasting friendship and together formed the Boone and Crockett Club to promote what they called "the manly"
"sport of hunting."
DUNCAN:
But Grinnell had other, larger issues in mind that he wanted to steer Teddy Roosevelt toward, and I think over time he became something of a mentor to Roosevelt, of taking this energetic guy, this guy who was a political
star, a rising political star, and gradually pointing him in directions that were clearly in Roosevelt's heart but needed that little tilt from George Bird Grinnell to bring them to fruition.
COYOTE:
As president of the new club, Theodore Roosevelt was increasingly drawn into Grinnell's battles, including the longstanding crusade to keep Yellowstone as pristine as possible.
It was a constant fight.
There were repeated attempts in Congress to reduce the park's size or open it up to greater commercial exploitation.
Roosevelt helped defeat them all.
But despite those successes, there was still no federal law giving Yellowstone's caretakers clear authority to protect its wildlife, including its dwindling herd of wild buffalo.
On March 13, 1894, two troopers out on patrol in Yellowstone heard shots in the distance and hurried in that direction.
[Gunshot]
Soon they came across several buffalo carcasses.
A man was hunched over one of them, so busily skinning it that he didn't realize the troopers were there until one of them was beside him with a drawn gun.
The poacher was Edgar Howell, and he had been methodically killing as many buffaloes as he could, planning to haul out their heads for sale to a Montana taxidermist.
As luck would have it, a reporter named Emerson Hough on assignment for "Forest and Stream," was also in the park with a photographer to do an article about Yellowstone in the winter.
When the poacher bragged that the worst punishment he could receive for his crime was expulsion from the park and the loss of only 26 dollars' worth of equipment,
Hough realized he had stumbled onto a great story and quickly telegraphed it to Grinnell in New York City.
Grinnell knew just what to do with it.
SCHULLERY:
Grinnell just pulled out all the stops.
He ran the story in "Forest and Stream."
He was in contact with everybody he knew who might be able to wake up, you know, the sleeping giant, the American public, and make them care about this, and he succeeded.
COYOTE:
Within a week, legislation was working its way through Congress, authorizing regulations that would finally protect the park, its geysers, and its Wildlife.
On May 7, 1894, less than two months after Howell's capture,
President Grover Cleveland signed the bill into law.
[Birds chirping]
SCHULLERY:
George Bird Grinnell and Theodore Roosevelt and the other defenders of Yellowstone were thinking in ecosystem terms before anybody was using the term.
They saw places like Yellowstone as reservoirs.
They used the term "reservoir."
It was a reservoir for wildlife.
I think if the opportunity presented by the capture of Howell had been missed, we would have lost the bison.
They were so close to gone.
MAN:
Gentlemen, why in heaven's name this haste?
You have time enough.
Why sacrifice the present to the future, fancying that you will be happier when your fields teem with wealth and your cities with people?
In Europe, we have cities wealthier and more populous than yours, and we are not happy.
You dream of your posterity, but your posterity will look back to yours as the golden age and envy those who first burst into this silent, splendid nature, who first lifted up their axes upon these tall trees and lined
these waters with busy wharves.
Why, then, seek to complete, in a few decades, what took the other nations of the world thousands of years?
Why, in your hurry to subdue and utilize nature, squander her splendid gifts?
You have opportunity such as mankind has never had before and may never have again.
Lord James Bryce.
MAN:
The first duty of the human race is to control the earth it lives upon.
The first principle of conservation is development, the use of natural resources now existing on this continent for the benefit of the people who live here now.
Gifford Pinchot.
COYOTE:
Gifford Pinchot was a graduate of Yale who had studied forestry in Germany and France and returned as the first American to declare himself a professional forester.
He and John Muir had met in 1896 and in the beginning enjoyed each other's company, camping together on the rim of the Grand Canyon.
But while the two men agreed that America's forests were being rapaciously destroyed, they ultimately parted company on the solution.
Muir considered forests sacred.
He wanted them treated as parks with logging, grazing, and hunting prohibited.
Pinchot didn't agree.
He wanted forests protected, too, but he believed the best way to do it was to manage their use, not leave them alone.
His favorite saying was "the greatest good"
"for the greatest number."
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
Much is said on questions of this kind about the greatest good for the greatest number, but the greatest number is too often found to be number one.
It is never the greatest number in the common meaning of the term that makes the greatest noise and stir on questions mixed with money.
Complaints are made in the name of poor settlers and miners, while the wealthy corporations are kept carefully hidden in the background.
Let right, commendable industry be fostered, but as to these Goths and Vandals of the wilderness who are spreading black death in the fairest woods God ever made, let the government up and at 'em.
CRONON:
We often tell stories about the origins of the American conservation movement by setting John Muir and Gifford Pinchot in counterpoint with each other.
Often in those stories, John Muir is the hero and Gifford Pinchot is the villain.
In fact, they represent, I think, two sides of one coin.
Muir is the figure who celebrates the sacred in nature... the wildness, the otherness of nature, that which we need to protect if we are not to contaminate things that are nonhuman with our own human agendas.
Pinchot, on the other hand, is about a conservation that celebrates sustainability.
It's about keeping the roots of our material lives in the natural world in such a way that we don't destroy nature as we use nature for our own livelihood.
COYOTE:
Congress and the administration of President
Grover Cleveland sided with Pinchot, who was appointed the nation's chief forester.
National forests would become part of the Department of Agriculture, used and managed like a crop, not preserved like a temple.
But if Muir could not prevail on the future of all national forests, he tried to salvage at least a partial victory by protecting one forest as a national park.
It was in western Washington state within sight of the cities of Seattle and Tacoma, the ancient homeland of nearly a dozen Indian tribes, including the Cowlitz,
Nisqually, Puyallup, and Yakima, who called it
Tahoma, the big mountain where the waters begin.
White settlers called it Mount Rainier.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
Altogether, this is the richest subalpine garden I ever found, a perfect floral elysium.
The icy dome needs not a man's care, but unless the reserve is guarded, the flower bloom will soon be killed, and nothing of the forest will be left but black stump monuments.
COYOTE:
A broad coalition, including the Sierra Club, the National Geographic Society, and the Northern
Pacific Railroad, worked hard with Muir for more than 5 years, and on March 2, 1899, Mount Rainier became the nation's fifth national park.
MAN:
When on the streets I meet young girls and matrons with their kindly faces and see the egrets in their bonnets and hats, I cannot help feeling that these daughters of Eve do not know how these feathers were obtained.
These plumes only grow while the bird is rearing its young, and I believe that if most of the women who wear them knew they were obtained by shooting the mother on her nest, they would be ashamed to keep them, even in secret,
much less to display them on the public streets.
John F. Lacey.
COYOTE:
For centuries, the nation's greatest breeding ground for its most beautiful plumed birds was southern
Florida, where the fresh waters of Lake Okeechobee drained slowly toward the Gulf of Mexico, through cypress swamps and mangrove forests and the biggest saw grass marsh in the world, the Everglades.
But by 1900, the long plumes of the great white and snowy egrets had become more valuable per ounce than gold, and nearly 95% of Florida's shorebirds had been killed by plume hunters.
More than 5 million birds a year were perishing to satisfy the demand of the latest fashion trend... using bird feathers to decorate women's hats.
Strolling the streets of New York for part of an afternoon, one ornithologist counted 542 feathered hats, representing
40 different species.
Some hats included an entire stuffed bird.
MAN AS GEORGE BIRD GRINNELL:
Fashion decrees feathers, and feathers it is.
This condition of affairs must be something of a shock to the leaders of the Audubon Society, who were sanguine enough to believe that the moral idea represented by their movement would be enough to influence society at large.
George Bird Grinnell.
COYOTE:
The Audubon Society had done its best to try to persuade women not to buy such hats, even promoted the sale of featherless hats called Audubonetts decorated with ribbons.
It didn't work, and the millenary industry, based principally in New York City, used its influence in Congress to defeat a series of national laws aimed at stopping the slaughter.
Then an unlikely champion stepped forward.
MAN AS JOHN F. LACEY:
We have a wireless telegraph, a thornless cactus, a seedless orange, and a coreless apple.
Let us now have a birdless hat.
John F. Lacey.
COYOTE:
As the Republican party began fracturing at the start of the 20th century into a progressive wing and a group of die-hard conservatives known as
Stand-Pat Republicans, Representative John F. Lacey of Oskaloosa, Iowa, counted himself with those opposed to change.
But when it came to defending wildlife or saving America's remaining unspoiled lands, Lacey's definition of conservative placed him not only outside his fellow
Stand-Patters but in the vanguard of even the most progressive politicians of the day.
MAN AS JOHN F. LACEY:
The first settlers found this continent a storehouse of energy and national wealth, but we have not been content with using these resources.
We have wasted them as reckless prodigals.
For more than 300 years, destruction was called improvement.
Mankind must conserve the resources of nature, or the world will, at no distant day, become as barren as a sucked orange.
COYOTE:
It had been Lacey, working with George Bird
Grinnell and Theodore Roosevelt, who pushed through the bill that finally gave government officials the tools they needed to protect America's last wild buffalo herd in Yellowstone.
Now, after years of ceaseless effort, he won passage of another landmark, the Lacey Bird and Game Act of 1900.
Soon, government agents were confiscating huge shipments of bird skins and feathers.
But the Lacey Act did not put an end to plume hunting entirely, especially in the lawless Everglades.
5 years after the bill's passage, a game warden was murdered by poachers.
3 years after that, another one was gunned down.
Some people began thinking that the uniquely abundant array of wildlife in southern Florida would never be safe unless the Everglades itself was set aside, like
Yellowstone, as a national park.
MAN AS JOHN F. LACEY:
The attempt to preserve and restore some of the wildlife of America is no longer looked upon as a fad or idle sentiment.
We have given an awful exhibition of slaughter and destruction which may serve as a warning to all mankind.
Let us now give an example of wise conservation of what remains of the gifts of nature.
COYOTE:
As America moved into a new century, a new word...
Conservation-mad crept into the nation's vocabulary.
Now a new president would turn the word into a movement.
MAN:
Like all Americans, I like big things... big prairies, big forests and mountains, big wheat fields, railroads, and herds of cattle, too.
Big factories, steamboats, and everything else.
CRONON:
I think it's hard to exaggerate the significance of Theodore Roosevelt in the history of American conservation.
He creates a presidency when he arrives in the White House that sets in motion most of the conservation agendas that will define the first half of the 20th century.
MAN:
The key to Teddy Roosevelt's leadership was his passion, his audacity, the fact that he was an inspiring public speaker and enjoyed leading the country.
He was a person who turned the country in a different direction where conservation was concerned.
COYOTE:
In the spring of 1903, Theodore Roosevelt once again boarded a train headed west, and on April 8, he stepped off at the Northern Pacific railroad terminal just outside of Yellowstone National Park.
He was no longer the scrawny and inexperienced Easterner cowboys had laughed at and called "four-eyes"
20 years earlier.
He was a national hero, the leader of the Rough Riders in the war with Spain, a former governor of New York state,
President William McKinley's running mate in 1900, and now, following McKinley's assassination in 1901, the youngest president in United States history.
MAN:
The president unites in himself powers and qualities that rarely go together... the qualities of a man of action with those of a scholar and writer... the instincts and accomplishments of the best breeding and culture with the broadest democratic sympathies.
He is doubtless the most vital man on the continent, if not on the planet, today.
John Burroughs.
COYOTE:
Not since Thomas Jefferson a century earlier had there been an American president with greater interest in the natural world.
JENKINSON:
Roosevelt began his life as a naturalist.
He formed Theodore Roosevelt's Natural History Museum as a child, and he was a taxidermist.
He would find snakes and mice and other creatures and sometimes store them in the refrigerator, the icebox of his family.
Several maids quit over this.
The house smelled of taxidermy.
He had formaldehyde everywhere.
This was a young boy who was fascinated by the idea of the museum and nature, but all of this is preliminary.
It wasn't until he went out to Dakota in 1883 that Roosevelt really started to understand what was at stake in the debate about the future of nature in this country.
COYOTE: "When I hear about the destruction of a species,"
he said, "I feel just as if the works"
"of some great writer had perished."
JENKINSON:
I think it can be said that Roosevelt invented the national wildlife refuge system.
This was done by executive order alone.
A national park needs to be voted on by a majority in two houses of Congress.
Roosevelt said to his attorney general Philander Knox,
"Is there anything that would prevent me"
"from naming Pelican Island on the Indian River in Florida"
"a national bird sanctuary?"
and Knox, the Attorney General, said, "No, nothing."
And so Roosevelt said, "I do declare it."
COYOTE:
When Roosevelt arrived in Yellowstone, he was in the middle of a national tour unprecedented in its ambition.
14,000 grueling miles.
25 states.
150 towns and cities.
More than 200 speeches in the space of 8 weeks.
From the day he left Washington, he had been looking forward to some time off in Yellowstone, and immediately upon his arrival, he set off on horseback with the Army's acting park superintendent as his host,
leaving the rest of the presidential entourage behind, including his staff, his Secret Service men, his physician, and all the reporters covering the trip.
"As far as the world at large is concerned,"
his private secretary told the press,
"The president will be lost."
Only John Burroughs, the popular nature writer, was allowed to come along.
The summer tourist season was still two months away, so Roosevelt had Yellowstone essentially to himself.
He loved every minute of it.
He delighted in seeing so many animals... herds of mule deer and Whitetails and pronghorn antelope, flocks of bighorn sheep.
He watched an eagle swoop down to try to capture a yearling elk, saw cougars feasting on the carcasses of their prey, spent 4 hours one afternoon looking through his field glasses, trying to count all the elk within sight,
ultimately estimating them to number 3,000.
On Easter morning, the President of the United States insisted on leaving the campsite entirely on his own.
He tramped 18 miles over rough ground in order to sneak up to within 50 yards of another elk herd, sat down on a rock, and gazed rapturously upon them while he ate his lunch of hardtack and sardines.
One morning, President Roosevelt was shaving, and he had lathered up his face with shaving cream, and he was shaving himself in the wilderness with a little mirror, when somebody came in and said,
"There are bighorn sheep out there"
"and they're coming down this cliff."
So, Roosevelt said, "By Godfrey, I have to see that,"
and he jumps up with half of his face clean-shaven and the other half full of lather and runs out into nature to see the bighorn sheep coming down this nearly sheer cliff.
And Burroughs said, "What kind of president is this?"
He's just an overgrown boy who's so enthusiastic about nature that it infects everyone around him with a new enthusiasm for the natural world.
COYOTE:
Roosevelt was witnessing firsthand the results of the wildlife protection bill he and George Bird Grinnell and Congressman John Lacey had worked so hard to pass.
The game animals were now much more numerous, he assured Burroughs, than when he had last visited the park 12 years earlier.
Still, the president was itching to shoot something.
SCHULLERY:
Roosevelt will always baffle people who don't hunt because he both loved animals and loved hunting them, and in Yellowstone, what he really wanted to do was shoot a mountain lion.
At the time, park managers were killing predators.
It was something that was going on anyway.
And so to Roosevelt's mind, "Well, why not me?"
COYOTE:
The president's advisers thought killing any animal in a national park would be bad politics and quietly dissuaded him.
In all, Roosevelt spent two weeks in Yellowstone, including several days traveling in a horse-drawn sleigh to the park's interior, still covered in some places by up to 6 feet of snow.
He saw the Norris geyser basin and Old Faithful and skied to the rim of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.
But these wonders held only passing interest to him compared to the park's wildlife.
In addition to the larger animals, he recorded sightings of pine squirrels and snowshoe hares and scores of different birds, including a pygmy owl, the first he had ever seen.
"He responded with boyish glee," Burroughs wrote.
"I think the president was as pleased"
"as if we had bagged some big game."
At one point, Roosevelt sees a mouse that he thinks is new to science, so he jumps off the sleigh and grabs it with his hand and kills it and then stuffs it.
MAN AS JOHN BURROUGHS:
While we all went fishing in the afternoon, the president skinned his mouse and prepared the pelt for Washington.
It was done as neatly as a professed taxidermist would have done it.
This was the only game the president killed in the park.
John Burroughs.
COYOTE:
On April 24, at the end of Roosevelt's visit, the entire population of the town of Gardiner, Montana, gathered at the park's north entrance for a special ceremony.
A new arch to welcome visitors to Yellowstone was under construction, and the president had agreed to speak at the laying of the arch's cornerstone.
For the occasion, Roosevelt reluctantly changed out of his camping clothes, put on a business suit, and rode through town to the awaiting crowd.
He watched as the cornerstone was carefully put into place, then climbed to a rough platform on the stonework of the incomplete pillar and began to speak.
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
The Yellowstone Park is something absolutely unique in the world, so far as I know.
This park was created and is now administered for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.
The scheme of its preservation is noteworthy in its essential democracy.
The only way that the people as a whole can secure to themselves and their children the enjoyment in perpetuity of what the Yellowstone park has to give is by assuming ownership in the name of the nation and jealously safeguarding and preserving
the scenery, the forests, and the wild creatures.
JENKINSON:
Roosevelt argued that the parks are a democratic experience.
That was his essential argument about the national parks, that the rich people always have their playgrounds, they know how to amuse themselves, and that America as a classless society or at least a society that would like to be classless
needs to have places where regular human beings can go and stand side by side with the rich and privileged and enjoy the same experience and not be made to feel that they are somehow less.
And so his primary argument was that the national parks are a democratic experiment in nature.
COYOTE:
Before he got back on the train to resume his trip,
Roosevelt also deliberately quoted from the act of Congress that had made Yellowstone the world's first national park...
"for the benefit and enjoyment of the people."
Later, when the arch was finally completed, that phrase would be permanently carved into its mantle so that everyone who entered Yellowstone would be reminded of why the park was there and for whom.
JOHNSON:
I remember the first time I arrived in Yellowstone,
I got off the bus right outside the north entrance, where there's that wonderful stone arch that says
"For the benefit and enjoyment of the people."
It doesn't say, "For the benefit and enjoyment"
"of some of the people, or a few of the people."
It says, "All of the people,"
and for me, that meant democracy, and for me, that meant I was welcome, and I stepped outside, and as I was stepping down onto the ground, there was bison, a 2,000-pound animal walking by,
and there was no one else around.
The bison was just strolling by.
And I looked up at the driver and I said,
"Does this happen all the time?"
and he looked at me and said, "All the time."
And I said to myself, "I've arrived,"
and I can't imagine being in any other place, and to be honest with you, once I stepped off that bus,
I never got back on.
[Whistle blows]
COYOTE:
Two weeks after leaving Yellowstone,
Roosevelt's whirlwind tour brought him to Arizona's Grand Canyon for a brief stop on the way from New Mexico to southern California.
Roosevelt had never before seen the Grand Canyon, and he was overwhelmed by the vista from the south rim.
He longed to spend more time there, but his schedule permitted only this quick visit and a few remarks to the crowd that had gathered to greet him.
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
I want to ask you to do one thing in connection with it in your own interest and in the interest of the country.
Keep this great wonder of nature as it now is.
Leave it as it is.
You cannot improve it.
The ages have been at work on it and man can only mar it.
What you can do is to keep it for your children, your children's children, and for all who come after you as one of the great sights which every American, if he can travel at all, should see.
JENKINSON:
The great statement in this speech is
"Leave it as it is."
"The ages have been at work on it"
"and man can only mar it."
Nothing has ever been said about the national parks as fine as that.
The idea for Roosevelt was that humans have an itch to change things... but the beauty of the Grand Canyon is when you look at it and you see nothing that humans have constructed.
It's a magnificent thing that he said, and if that were the one wilderness statement of American life,
I believe it's greater than Thoreau.
I believe that it's greater than John Muir.
"Leave it as it is.
The ages have been at work on it"
"and man can only mar it"
should be the motto in front of every national park in the country.
And if you think that this was said by a man on a 14,000-mile trip in which he gave 262 speeches more or less off the top of his head on seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time, you realize what presidential greatness can be.
COYOTE:
Then Roosevelt was gone... and by the next day, he was whistle-stopping his way through California, giving 2 to 3 speeches a day, attending banquets and dinners in his honor, presiding at dedications and groundbreakings,
setting the frenetic pace that had become his hallmark.
[Bird cawing]
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
Nothing can be done well at a speed of 40 miles a day.
Far more time should be taken.
Walk away quietly in any direction and taste the freedom of the mountaineer.
Climb the mountains and get their good tidings.
Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees.
The winds will blow their own freshness into you and the storms their energy while cares will drop off like autumn leaves.
COYOTE:
By 1903, John Muir was 65 and more famous than ever.
Mountain peaks and canyons, campsites and glaciers now bore his name.
Magazine editors besieged him with requests for articles.
The Sierra Club he had founded was growing steadily, and the hikes he personally led into the mountains were always the club's most heavily attended.
People loved to hear him preach his deeply held gospel that salvation could be found through immersion in the natural world.
WOMAN:
John Muir was there, mounted on the horse which he rode now and then, when no woman would accept the loan of it.
He was rapt, entranced.
He threw up his arms in a grand gesture.
"This is the morning of creation," he cried.
"The whole thing is beginning now."
"The mountains are singing together."
Harriet Monroe.
COYOTE:
For nearly a decade now, he had been struggling to have the Yosemite Valley given back to the federal government and made part of the larger Yosemite National Park.
But nothing he seemed to say or do had proven successful.
Things remained at a standstill in the spring of 1903, as Muir prepared to leave his home in Martinez, California, and embark on a trip to Europe and Asia with some friends.
Suddenly, his plans changed.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
An influential man from Washington wants to make a trip into the Sierra with me, and I might be able to do some forest good, in freely talking around the campfire.
COYOTE:
It was the president, still working his way up through California, asking Muir to accompany him during a visit to Yosemite.
"I do not want anyone with me but you,"
Roosevelt had written.
"I want to drop politics absolutely"
"and just be out in the open with you."
Muir realized this was the opportunity of a lifetime.
He purchased a brand-new woolen suit for the occasion and hurried to join the presidential entourage.
On May 15, they set off for the Mariposa Grove of big trees in a flurry of activity.
A long caravan of wagons filled with staff and dignitaries, a detachment of 30 buffalo soldiers riding along as escorts.
Muir soon found himself seated in the president's coach along with the governor of California, the Secretary of the Navy, the Surgeon General, two college presidents, and Roosevelt's personal secretary.
It was hardly the trip he had been promised, but Muir tried his best to squeeze in words to the president and governor about the issue of making all of Yosemite a national park.
In the grove of mighty sequoias, the president's group paused, as all tourists did, for a snapshot at the famous Wawona tunnel tree, and later, they posed for an official photograph, lined up along the base of the Grizzly Giant,
the oldest and most famous sequoia in Yosemite, estimated to be 2,700 years old and boasting a single branch that was 6 1/2 feet in diameter.
Then the troops, the phalanx of reporters and photographers, and virtually all of the official party headed back to the Wawona Hotel, where a series of receptions and a grand dinner were scheduled in the president's honor
that evening.
None of them knew that Roosevelt had no intention of attending.
Instead, he remained behind with only John Muir and a few park employees, who started preparing a camp at the base of one of the sequoias, part of a secret plan Roosevelt had hatched to allow him time alone with the trees
and the man who considered them sacred.
They built a fire and sat around it, eating a simple supper, talking as twilight enveloped them, getting to know one another in the glow of the blaze.
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
The night was clear, and in the darkening aisles of the great sequoia grove, the majestic trunks, beautiful in color and symmetry, rose around us like the pillars of a mightier cathedral than ever was conceived even by the fervor of the Middle Ages.
Hermit thrushes sang beautifully in the evening.
JENKINSON:
And Muir said,
"I fell in love with this Theodore Roosevelt."
I mean, he actually used those words.
"You can't resist this man.
I fell in love with him."
Roosevelt, interestingly enough, came back and complained a little bit about Muir and said, "He doesn't know his bird songs."
Roosevelt's an ornithologist.
He knows everything there is to know about birds.
But Muir also got one off on Roosevelt.
He said to him, "Mr. President,"
"when are you going to get over this infantile need you have"
"to kill animals?"
Roosevelt would not have taken that from any other human being.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
I had a perfectly glorious time with the president and the mountains.
I never before had a more interesting, hearty, and manly companion.
I stuffed him pretty well regarding the timber thieves and other spoilers of the forest.
COYOTE:
Long after sundown, with no tent and only a pile of army blankets, the two men finally went to sleep.
[Owl hooting]
[Horse whinnying]
COYOTE:
The next morning at 6:30, they saddled up for the long ride to Yosemite Valley, with the guide under strict orders from the president to avoid at all costs the Wawona Hotel and the delegation of officials he had jilted the night before.
In the high country near Glacier Point, with its spectacular panorama of the valley and its waterfalls arrayed at their feet, they stopped and once more made camp at a spot their guide...
Charlie Leidig... had picked out.
MAN AS CHARLIE LEIDIG:
Around the campfire, Roosevelt and Muir talked far into the night regarding Muir's glacial theory of the formation of Yosemite Valley.
They also talked a great deal about the protection of forests in general and Yosemite in particular.
I heard them discussing the setting aside of other areas in the United States for park purposes.
There was some difficulty in their campfire conversation because both men wanted to do the talking.
COYOTE:
They awoke the next morning, covered by a light snow that had fallen in the high country during the night.
Rather than feeling inconvenienced, the president couldn't have been more delighted.
"We slept in a snowstorm last night,"
he exclaimed to the crowds that had been patiently waiting for him on the valley floor.
"This," he said, "has been the grandest day of my life."
After camping one more night alone with Muir, the president was picked up and escorted back to the train station for the resumption of his cross-country tour.
And when he spoke at the state capital in Sacramento a day later,
Roosevelt's words sounded as if they could have come from the lips of John Muir.
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
Lying out at night under those sequoias was lying in a temple built by no hand of man.
A temple grander than any human architect could by any possibility build, and I hope for the preservation of the groves of giant trees simply because it would be a shame to our civilization to let them disappear.
They are monuments in themselves.
I want them preserved.
We are not building this country of ours for a day.
It is to last through the ages.
COYOTE:
Within 3 years, the California legislature and United States Congress approved the transfer of the Yosemite Valley and Mariposa big trees back to the federal government.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
I am now an experienced lobbyist.
My political education is complete.
Have attended the legislature, made speeches, explained, exhorted, persuaded every mother's son of the legislators, newspaper reporters, and everybody else who would listen to me.
And now that the fight is finished and my education as a politician and lobbyist is finished,
I am almost finished myself.
COYOTE:
Yosemite National Park now encompassed almost everything
Muir had been fighting for.
"Sound the timbrel," he wrote a friend,
"and let every Yosemite tree and stream rejoice."
JOHNSON:
I remember one day I was walking in the Cook's Meadow, which is the meadow in the central part of Yosemite Valley, and there was a woman there, and she was just looking up and around her
and she just kept saying, "Oh.
Oh, my."
"Oh, my."
I looked at her, I said, "Ma'am, are you all right?"
She said, "Yes, I'm just fine.
I just... oh."
I didn't have to talk to her about the transcendent experience.
She was having one, and it wasn't a transcendent experience because it was a national park.
It was transcendent because it was Yosemite Valley.
But because it had become a national park, she could have that transcendent experience.
And that's commonplace in Yosemite.
And where else can you get an experience like that?
[Bird cawing]
WOMAN:
In other parts of the world, there are certain areas that are preserved because some rich nobleman out of the goodness of his heart decided to decree it.
But in the United States, you don't have to be dependent on some rich guy being generous to you.
To me that's what national parks mean.
It's a symbol of democracy, democracy when it works well.
At its best.
COYOTE:
Back in 1870, a 15-year-old boy in Kansas was idly reading the newspaper that had been used to wrap his lunch.
He came across an article about a mysterious sunken lake in Oregon and he vowed to visit it one day.
It would take William Gladstone Steel 15 years to get there.
MAN AS WILLIAM STEEL:
Imagine a vast mountain, 6 by 7 miles through, at an elevation of 8,000 feet with the top removed and the inside hollowed out, then filled with the clearest water in the world, and you have a perfect representation
of Crater Lake.
COYOTE:
When a volcanic eruption witnessed by the ancestors of the Klamath Indians blew the top off a mountain peak in the Cascades 7,700 years ago, the hole that was left began slowly filling with each year's rainfall and snowmelt.
The result was Crater Lake...
At 1,942 feet, the deepest lake in America.
Because it is filled almost entirely by snowfall, the lake is also the world's clearest.
An 8-inch disc lowered into its sky-blue waters is still visible 142 feet below the surface.
William Steel resolved that it should be protected forever, just like Yellowstone and the other parks.
That quest took him another 17 years of tireless promotion and lobbying before he finally succeeded in 1902, when Crater Lake became the nation's sixth national park.
And it had all happened because of this accidental lunchtime reading
32 years earlier.
DUNCAN:
The parks, they're the greatest spots on earth, wonderful natural places, but the story of national parks really isn't a story about the place.
It's... it's the story of people who fell in love with those places, people who became so devoted to them that they wanted to do anything they could to save them.
SMITH:
Richard Wetherill.
He's broadening out from Mesa Verde.
He wants to make people aware that we have such a treasure, such a heritage here, and yet here's this cowboy.
A cowboy, and we all know what cowboys are.
We read in our dime novels.
They can't be doing anything scholarly.
COYOTE:
Despite his lack of formal education,
Richard Wetherill wanted to be taken seriously as an archaeologist.
He had left Mesa Verde and began scouring the Southwest in search of other ruins.
His journey took him from Colorado to Utah and Arizona and finally to New Mexico, to a place called Chaco Canyon.
Another eerily silent set of ruins left behind by the ancient Puebloans.
With walls of remarkable workmanship, some rising 5 stories,
Pueblo Bonito, the biggest ruin, contained remnants of an enclosed plaza,
35 circular kivas, more than 2 acres honeycombed by 650 rooms, connected by small passageways and doors.
The religious and cultural hub of the civilization that had dominated the surrounding region between 850 A.D. and 1200 A.D.
By itself, Pueblo Bonito was several times larger than anything at Mesa Verde and it sat in the midst of an array of nearly a dozen other significant ruins.
Wetherill moved there with his wife Marietta, filed a homestead claim, and hired nearly 100 Navajos to help with the excavations.
Though Wetherill tried to carry on his work as carefully and scientifically as possible, professional archaeologists still dismissed him as a pothunter.
And as the relics he was unearthing reached eastern museums,
50,000 pieces of turquoise, 10,000 pieces of pottery, 5,000 stone implements, and much more, they clamored for the government to do something to stop him.
SMITH:
Richard Wetherill was very careful identifying everything he found.
He was ahead of the professional archaeologists, which is an oxymoron at that time, but he was ahead of them, and I think they were jealous of him.
There's a snobbishness.
Educated Easterners can't believe that a western cowboy could possibly be doing these things.
COYOTE:
For his part, Wetherill said, he would gladly turn over any portions of Chaco Canyon if the federal government would simply do something to protect them.
But the criticism of Wetherill's work would not go away.
[Bird cawing]
COYOTE:
Meanwhile, back at Mesa Verde, the ruins Wetherill had first discovered were in danger.
Thieves, pot hunters, and tourists were flocking to the site, looting the artifacts, damaging the ancient structures, sometimes even setting off sticks of dynamite simply to frighten away the rattlesnakes.
Now a new group had taken up the cause of protecting its treasures.
WOMAN:
Mesa Verde seems to be set apart for a park, and to make and keep it as such is the aim of the Colorado Cliff Dwellings Association of Women.
Virginia McClurg.
COYOTE:
Virginia McClurg was a well-known lecturer with a seemingly boundless determination to leave her mark on the world.
She gathered a group of women into the Colorado Cliff Dwellings Association, organized petitions, wrote personal letters to the president, held rummage sales, and solicited
10-cent contributions from other women's groups across the country.
And it was working.
Support for protecting Mesa Verde had become a national cause.
But just when Congress seemed ready to act, it became clear to those around her that Virginia McClurg had a different vision of how Mesa Verde should be preserved.
WOMAN AS VIRGINIA McCLURG:
I do not see why this small and compact tract in the proposed park should not be under the protective care of a body of 125 women with hereditary membership who know more about the matter and care about the matter
than anyone else.
Virginia became so engrossed in it that it suddenly was not our park as a nation, it was her park.
COYOTE:
Twice McClurg even negotiated leases between her group and the Ute Indians only to have the federal government remind her that private citizens cannot make treaties.
The uproar she created threatened to derail the bill in Congress at the very moment it seemed headed for passage.
Even some of her closest allies now suspected that Virginia McClurg had lost sight of the real goal.
Lucy Peabody, the association's vice regent, had preferred to get results rather than grab headlines.
She believed that only as a national park could Mesa Verde be properly saved for future generations, and now felt compelled to resign from the association.
With her went many other members, including some of the group's most nationally prominent women.
McClurg, once the darling of the press, found herself disparaged in newspaper editorials.
SMITH:
There was a sadness in all this.
At the moment of your greatest achievement, you lose it.
I...
I think it's a normal reaction.
This becomes so possessive with her that to have it within your grasp, right there, and it's gone.
COYOTE:
On June 29, 1906,
President Roosevelt signed the law creating Mesa Verde National Park, the first of its kind, meant to celebrate not majestic natural scenery but a prehistoric culture and its people.
With Mesa Verde protected, anger over Richard Wetherill's excavations at Chaco Canyon in New Mexico boiled over and set in motion events that would change the course of park history.
SMITH:
The bill for Mesa Verde was just for Mesa Verde, but what about the other ruins?
There's sites all over the Southwest, and the same thing's happening there.
COYOTE:
Once more, Representative John F. Lacey came to the rescue of places nowhere near and nothing like his native Iowa.
He sponsored a new bill to make any unauthorized disturbance of any prehistoric ruin a federal crime.
The act for the preservation of American antiquities also granted the president of the United States an extraordinary power:
the exclusive authority without any Congressional approval to set aside places that would be called not national parks but national monuments.
MAN:
John F. Lacey gave the president the greatest power a president could ever have for the preservation of nature, which allowed the president to do something as simple as pick up a pen and declare an area of the public domain
a national monument, and since Teddy Roosevelt happened to be the president at the time, was that a gift or what?
Bully.
Delighted.
Teddy Roosevelt picked up that pen and started creating national monuments and the country would never be the same again.
COYOTE:
Roosevelt quickly put his new powers to use.
He proclaimed the first national monument, a unique mass of grooved rock sacred to several Indian tribes rising nearly 900 feet above the plains of eastern Wyoming.
It was called Devil's Tower.
Then he named El Morro National Monument in New Mexico, a rock abutment bearing prehistoric Indian petroglyphs as well as the inscriptions of early Spanish expeditions that had come north from Mexico 300 years earlier and founded a colony 15 years before the Pilgrims
landed at Plymouth Rock.
And on March 11, 1907, he did exactly what Richard Wetherill had wanted and created Chaco Canyon National Monument.
Roosevelt would also use the antiquities act to protect an endangered grove of coastal redwoods north of San Francisco named in honor of the man who had first introduced Roosevelt to the giant trees...
Muir Woods.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
The man of science, the naturalist, too often loses sight of the essential oneness of all living beings in seeking to classify them in kingdoms, orders, species, etc.
While the eye of the poet, the seer, never closes on the kinship of all God's creatures.
And his heart ever beats in sympathy with great and small alike as Earth-borne companions and fellow mortals equally dependent on Heaven's eternal love.
COYOTE:
In 1905, John Muir's life had been beset by sorrow.
His devoted life Louie died of lung cancer and he buried her next to her parents near an orchard on their farm.
President Roosevelt, who had lost his first wife as a young man, and then found solace in the open spaces of the west, sent his personal condolences.
"Get out among the mountains and trees, friend," he wrote.
"They will do more for you than either man or woman could."
But the aging mountaineer went instead to the deserts of Arizona, where it was hoped his daughter Helen might recover from pneumonia.
In his grief, he began exploring the surrounding area and discovered that in fact he was, once again, in a majestic forest, only this one was 200 million years old and all of the trees had long ago fossilized
into solid rock.
It was the petrified forest.
EHRLICH:
I think parks represent the wildness inside us.
They're the place where we can be lonely, where we can experience solitude.
They're a place we go to as refuge, as sanctuary.
It's a place we go out to to come back in.
It's the only place perhaps left in many people's lives where that's possible.
COYOTE:
Soon, Muir was himself again, sometimes taking total strangers on long walks through the tumbled and broken stone trees.
In what he now called
"these enchanted carboniferous forests,"
he loved nothing more than to sit near the trunk of a petrified tree and inspect it minutely with a magnifying glass.
But even this forest was endangered.
Scavengers used dynamite to blow up large logs in hopes of finding amethyst crystals inside them.
Boxcar loads of petrified wood were being shipped east to be made into tabletops and mantelpieces.
An enormous stone crusher was being constructed to pulverize the logs for use as industrial abrasives.
For years, John F. Lacey had been trying to protect the area by making it a national park.
Congress would not go along.
But John Muir knew somebody who now could save his enchanted forest with a stroke of his pen.
President Roosevelt invoked the antiquities act again, and Petrified Forest National Monument was created.
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
There is nothing more practical than the preservation of beauty, than the preservation of anything that appeals to the higher emotions of mankind.
I believe we are past the stage of national existence when we could look on complacently at the individual who skinned the land and was content for the sake of 3 years' profit for himself to leave a desert for the children of those
who were to inherit the soil.
JENKINSON:
If government doesn't protect the weakest elements of humanity and the weakest elements of nature... the whole game is lost.
That was an incredible breakthrough for a man who grew up in a profoundly Republican household in an age of J.P. Morgan and John Rockefeller.
There's a paradox at the very center of American life.
We are meant to be the most materially happy, wealthiest, most privileged people who ever lived on Earth.
That's one version of the American dream.
We are also Thoreau's Americans and Jefferson's Americans, and Roosevelt's Grand Canyon Americans.
We want that, and somehow we've gotten it into our heads that we can have both, and maybe we can.
But Roosevelt understood that we can only have both if we severely restrain our acquisitive energies for some parts of this continent.
That's the key.
UDALL:
We used to talk about Teddy Roosevelt having distance in his eyes... and that's what's important, is to have this strong, powerful part of our heritage vivid so that people can understand it and appreciate it.
COYOTE:
Before his presidency was over, he would create 5 new national parks, 51 federal bird sanctuaries, 4 national game refuges,
18 national monuments, and more than 100 million acres worth of national forests.
Now Roosevelt wanted one more national park added to his list, the place he had urged the citizens of Arizona to leave as it is...
The grandest canyon on Earth.
Developers were already erecting buildings, miners were filing claims, and ranchers were grazing cattle all along the south rim.
But even Theodore Roosevelt could not persuade Congress to act.
Local sentiment and vested interests were just too powerful.
The president looked for some way, any way to prevent the canyon from becoming another commercialized Niagara Falls.
He found his solution in the antiquities act.
CRONON:
It was written basically to try to prevent the destruction of Indian archeological sites in the American southwest, the idea being that there were people going in and robbing these graves, and that that needed to be stopped.
And so a law is written that says the president can very quickly set aside a tract of land as a national monument, and that's a fairly narrow purpose.
But there were no restrictions in the law, and Teddy Roosevelt quite quickly realized that you could set aside land for reasons other than archeology, and the great beneficiary of that law would be the Grand Canyon.
COYOTE:
The wording of the antiquities act referred to protection of so-called
"objects of historic and scientific interest,"
and though it had contemplated only small-sized parcels, up to then, no more than 5,000 acres, it did not absolutely restrict the number of acres a president could set aside.
On January 11, 1908, declaring the Grand Canyon
"an object of unusual scientific interest,"
"being the greatest eroded canyon"
"within the United States,"
Roosevelt set aside 806,400 acres as a national monument.
It would not enjoy the same protections as a national park, but it was a step in the right direction.
Politicians in Arizona were outraged and threatened to challenge Roosevelt in court.
Members of Congress complained that the president had overstepped his authority.
He ignored them all.
UDALL:
A lot of Westerners, powerful Westerners,
Congressmen, senators, were opposed and critical... and that was part of Teddy Roosevelt's power, that he could overwhelm the wishes of local people and dared to do it.
JENKINSON:
Well, there was furor.
There is always furor when these things happen.
Short-term.
But Roosevelt understood that short-term controversy over nature leads to long-term benefit.
Roosevelt's view was that an intact environment is infinitely more valuable spiritually and economically than an extracted one.
UDALL:
But history always vindicates, always vindicates what they did.
There's not a single person in Arizona today who would say the Grand Canyon was a mistake.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
The very first reservation that ever was made in this world, the garden of Eden, contained only one tree.
The smallest reservation that ever was made.
Yet no sooner was it made than it was attacked by everybody in the world... the devil, one woman, and one man.
This has been the history of every reservation that has been made since that time, that is, as soon as a reservation is once created, then the thieves and the devil and his relations come forward to attack it.
DUNCAN:
He said, "Nothing dollarable is safe"... and it's like this insight into human beings, but particularly Americans.
He understood this relentless grasp of American commerce.
It wants to reach into everything.
And he realized that if a dollar value could be attached to, in his mind, a sacred place, it was vulnerable.
COYOTE:
Since the start of the 20th century, the city of San Francisco had been looking for a better supply of water to fuel its growth, and it had set its sights on the Tuolumne River and the Hetch Hetchy Valley
as the perfect place for a darn and reservoir, a narrow valley remote enough to assure that the waters trapped from the yearly Sierra runoff would stay pure.
The fact that it was within the boundaries of Yosemite National Park only added to its attractiveness to city planners.
No competing claims to water rights existed.
The only land owner to deal with was the federal government.
Damming and flooding Hetch Hetchy would be cheaper and easier than finding alternative sites.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
That anyone would try to destroy such a place seems incredible, but sad experience shows that there are people good enough and bad enough for anything.
COYOTE:
To John Muir, allowing a darn in any national park would betray the very purpose of parks, and even worse in his eyes, set a dangerous precedent for the future.
Hetch Hetchy was among his favorite places in Yosemite.
He called it "one of nature's rarest"
"and most precious mountain temples."
With its own majestic waterfalls and massive granite faces, it had all the beauty of the more famous Yosemite Valley
20 miles to the south, he said, without the clutter of tourist hotels.
When he had helped draw the boundary lines for the national park back in 1890, he had deliberately included Hetch Hetchy.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
These temple destroyers, devotees of ravaging commercialism, seem to have a perfect contempt for nature, and instead of lifting their eyes to the god of the mountains, lift them to the almighty dollar.
Darn Hetch Hetchy.
As well, darn for water-tanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man.
COYOTE:
At first, Muir's view had prevailed.
Theodore Roosevelt's interior secretary turned down San Francisco's application 3 different times.
Then on April 18, 1906, a tremendous earthquake had shaken San Francisco, bringing down hundreds of buildings and igniting fires that consumed most of the city, killing thousands.
With San Francisco reduced to ashes, politicians redoubled their efforts for a reservoir at Hetch Hetchy, claiming falsely that its water supply could have prevented the destruction.
In a referendum, San Franciscans voted 7-1 in favor of the darn.
The city's mayor launched a campaign attacking Muir's character for trying to obstruct the project.
Even Muir's own Sierra Club split over the issue, with some prominent members advocating the dam.
MAN:
They loved Yosemite, but they loved Yosemite in a kind of additive way.
It wasn't at the core of their understanding of America.
And for them in San Francisco, the city came first.
COYOTE:
Meanwhile, an old adversary of Muir's stepped forward on the city's behalf...
Gifford Pinchot.
As the nation's top forester and President Roosevelt's trusted adviser,
Pinchot had become one of the most powerful men in Washington.
At his urging, Roosevelt had reserved millions of acres of western land as national forests in the face of Congressional opposition.
Pinchot steadfastly believed that conservation meant wise use of nature, not preserving it for its own sake, and he had never been a wholehearted supporter of national parks, let alone John Muir's unbending vision of protecting and expanding them.
When a new interior secretary joined the administration,
Pinchot began lobbying him in support of the darn.
In response, Muir once again took his case to the man with whom he had shared
3 magical nights in the park back in 1903...
The outdoorsman he considered a friend and kindred spirit.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
April 21, 1908.
Dear Mr. President, a few promoters of the present scheme all show forth a proud set of confidence that comes from a good, sound, substantial irrefragable ignorance.
Hetch Hetchy is one of the most sublime and beautiful and important features of the park, and to darn and submerge it would be hardly less destructive and deplorable than would be the damming of Yosemite itself.
Faithfully and devotedly yours, John Muir.
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
My dear Mr. Muir,
Pinchot is rather favorable to the Hetch Hetchy plan.
I have sent him your letter with a request for a report on it.
I will do everything in my power to protect not only the Yosemite, which we have already protected, but other similar great natural beauties of this country.
But you must remember that it is out of the question permanently to protect them, unless we have a certain degree of friendliness toward them on the part of the people of the state in which they are situated.
CRONON:
What makes the conflict between Muir and Pinchot so bitter, so personal is that 2 really wonderful visions of the human good, both of which are worth celebrating, are on a collision course, and that collision course meets
in Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park.
For one man, Muir, that valley and that park are a cathedral, and anything that might desecrate that cathedral is blasphemy.
It is a... it is a sacrilege against God.
For the other man, Pinchot, these are resources that serve the common good.
These are resources for a democracy.
COYOTE:
But Pinchot was in Washington and Muir was in California.
Pinchot's view prevailed.
Pending Congressional approval, the interior secretary granted San Francisco's application, calling it "the greatest benefit"
"to the greatest number of people."
President Roosevelt did nothing to stop it.
Muir was devastated.
But the fight was not over.
A year later, with Roosevelt out of the White House, the new president, William Howard Taft, came to California on his own tour of Yosemite, and to the dismay of San Francisco's politicians, chose Muir as his guide.
Before the visit was over, Taft decided to oppose the darn.
By 1913, however, yet another president had taken office...
Woodrow Wilson, who chose as his secretary of the interior
Franklin K. Lane, the former city attorney for San Francisco.
Lane wasted no time getting the project back on track.
Muir was now 75, and the long battle over Hetch Hetchy had taken its toll.
Ten years earlier, he had anticipated completing 20 books in his old age.
Because of what he called "this everlasting"
"Hetch Hetchy business,"
he had managed to finish only 2.
"I wonder," he wrote his daughter,
"if leaves feel lonely when they see their neighbors falling."
Still, he soldiered on, speaking, writing, urging anyone who would listen not to flood the exquisite valley.
"I still think we can win," Muir said in November of 1913, adding,
"anyhow, I'll be relieved when it's settled,"
"for it's killing me."
3 weeks later, the bill approving the dam cleared its final hurdle in Congress.
President Wilson quickly signed it into law.
MAN:
It was sorrowful indeed to see him sitting in his cobwebbed study in his lonely house with the full force of his defeat upon him after the struggle of a lifetime in the service of Hetch Hetchy.
I could not but think that if Congress, the president, and even the San Francisco contingent could have seen him, they would certainly have been willing to have delayed any action until the old man had gone away.
And I fear that is going to be very soon... as he appeared to me to be breaking very fast.
Robert Marshall.
COYOTE:
Exhausted and frail,
Muir forced himself to finish a book on his travels in Alaska.
He built new bookcases in the big, empty house he had once shared with his wife Louie and their 2 children.
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
The battle for conservation will go on endlessly.
It is part of the universal warfare between right and wrong.
Fortunately, wrong cannot last.
Soon or late, it must fall back home to Hades, while some compensating good must surely follow.
They will see what I meant in time.
There must be places for human beings to satisfy their souls... food and drink is not all.
There is the spiritual.
In some, it is only a germ, of course.
But the germ will grow.
COYOTE:
In December of 1914, he came down with pneumonia.
On Christmas Eve, John Muir, the wilderness prophet who had struggled so hard to get his adopted country to experience the blessings of nature, died.
POPE:
I think when John Muir walked into Yosemite, a century-long conversation began... and it was a conversation about the nature of America and about whether we were going to remain what Lincoln called "the last best hope of Earth"
or whether we were simply going to become another Europe.
And John Muir's encounter with Yosemite...
Remember, he was a European.
He came from this narrow Scots background.
He was not an American.
And he encountered Yosemite and he imagined what America could be.
And for a century, we've fought about whether we liked his vision or not.
MAN:
I like what he said on one occasion where he essentially said, "the enemies of wildness"
"are invincible, and they are everywhere,"
"but the fight must go on..."
"and for every acre that you gain,"
"10,000 trees and flowers and all the other forest people"
"and the usual unborn generations"
"will rise up and call you blessed."
COYOTE: 4 years after Muir's death, work on the darn he had opposed with all his strength began, and the Hetch Hetchy valley, whose tranquil meadows he had compared to a landscape garden and a mountain temple
would slowly be entombed under hundreds of feet of water.
But Muir's fight had struck a chord in many Americans, who now wondered if a lovely valley in Yosemite National Park could be turned into a reservoir, were any national parks safe?
CRONON:
John Muir lost the fight over Hetch Hetchy and the darn was built, and people who live in San Francisco today drink the water of Hetch Hetchy.
Muir died feeling that he'd been defeated by that, and that was a great tragedy at the end of his life.
But it's also true that Hetch Hetchy would then go on across the 20th century as a kind of battle cry that would inform all wilderness, wild land, parkland battles from that moment on.
It looks like a defeat, and yet what's interesting about it is that in that defeat, a whole series of people began to wonder whether the parks needed more protection than they currently had.
That there needed to be some greater rampart, some greater wall that could defend the parks against a future such controversy.
COYOTE:
A proposal that Muir had supported now began gaining greater ground across the nation...
To create an agency within the federal government whose sole job would be to promote, administer, and protect the national parks, to make sure they fulfilled their great promise and endured for countless generations.
MAN:
Muir said...
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
As long as I live, I will hear the birds and the winds and the waterfalls sing.
I'll interpret the rocks and learn the language of flood, of storm and avalanche.
I'll make the acquaintance of the wild gardens and the glaciers and get as near to the heart of this world as I could.
And so I did.
I sauntered about from rock to rock, from grove to grove, from stream to stream, and whenever I met a new plant,
I would sit down beside it for a minute or a day to make its acquaintance, hear what it had to tell.
I asked the boulders where they had been and whither they were going and when night found me, there I camped.
I took no more heed to save time or to make haste than did the trees or the stars.
This is true freedom, a good practical sort of immortality.
All right, I want you to have a couple bites, all right?
I think that you need to focus more on your academics.
No, she did all her homework before dinner.
Dressing, honey?
Sure, thank you.
All right.
Sex has been a disaster for me my entire life.
Daddy?
Mm-hmm?
What's a blow job?
I couldn't say "blow job" for ten years after that.
Let alone give one.
But I could still wonder about it.
Especially if it had anything to do with
French-kissing Bobby Daples.
But even then, when it came to sex- total disaster.
By the time the bottle finally landed on Bobby, he must have watched me kiss over 100 boys.
I'm not kissing you.
You're a slut.
I didn't kiss another boy until my last year of college.
Promise it won't hurt?
No, no, honey, it's not gonna hurt at all.
Really?
Trust me.
It's gonna feel great.
You're gonna absolutely love this.
Okay.
Trust me.
I'm a little scared.
He dumped me the next day, and I finally accepted the harsh truth.
I sucked at sex.
Romance?
That was a whole other story.
I gotta go.
Oh, come on.
You're torturing me.
It's gonna be worth the wait.
Honestly, I knew it wasn't worth the wait for either one of us, but as long as I was in the power position,
I was happy.
But there was one place where love was honest, selfless and eternal.
It was the closest I could come to succeeding in love... and sex.
I didn't just fall in love with watching them,
I fell in love with making them.
I could rearrange reality the way I wanted... and it was addictive.
Jody, this has to be, hands down, the best fucking sex I've ever had.
I can't believe you're a virgin.
That's impossible.
Two years later, I was graduating from NYU Film School.
And now for our final award.
Mr. Marshall, if you please.
Professor Emerich, thank you.
This year's special award for Best Student Film goes to...
Jody Balaban.
Whoa, yes!
Jody, where are you?
Jody, wait!
That's Garry Marshall up there, okay?
Show him those lips are good for giving more than an acceptance speech.
"Pretty Woman," baby!
"Pretty Woman"!
Hi, here you go.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Hi, our friendly filmmaker.
Take a picture.
Who are these people?
Oh, those are my parents.
Ah, for the parents.
It was the best day of my life.
The day I knew I was destined to do great things.
Hi, it's Jody Balaban calling again for Mr. Marshall.
Sure, I can call back in six months, but I'd really like to-
After a year in LA,
I realized the closest I'd ever get to directing was directing traffic.
I just wanted to drop my résumé off.
He gave me the Best Student Film award.
This is crazy.
I've sent out hundreds of copies of my script, my film and my résumé.
I've spent more money on postage than I have on my rent.
Mr. Marshall's office.
Hi, it's Jody Balaban for Mr. Marshall.
Wait, didn't you call yesterday?
Yes, I called-
I'd answered ads for every job in this business and I can't get anyone to call me back.
Asshole!
That asshole was the one that hit me!
It was the fifth job I was fired from in a year.
But at least I still had my dignity.
Fuck!
So what'd you think?
It's even better than it was before.
Oh, really?
Yeah, really, really.
Jody, it's hilarious, but you have rewritten this thing 100 times and you are still the only one that's read it.
You gotta get it out there, you know?
You gotta get it read by somebody who matters.
I can't get anyone to return my calls.
You know that.
You have to network.
You have to go out and play the game.
I moved out here a month after you and I'm already working for Joel Metzger.
The hottest- Exec in town.
Yeah.
I know and that's different.
Why?
Because I wanna break into producing?
No, because you're blowing him.
I should just make the movie myself.
We could shoot it super low-budget.
"We"?
You said yourself, it's a great script.
Yeah, Jody, but be realistic.
How are you gonna afford camera, lights, a crew, sets?
I mean, you're broke.
I could sell my grandma's engagement ring.
That is a family heirloom.
Your parents would kill you.
All artists make sacrifices for their dreams.
Put your big dreams aside for a little while.
You're 24 years old.
Go on a date or something.
Good night, I love you.
I love you, too.
Who am I kidding?
I'd love some romance in my life, but I can't afford to lose my focus.
Not now.
I just needed one yes.
Someone who'd give me a chance.
You have one new message.
Hi, honey, it's Mom.
I just finished your screenplay.
Oh, I just- I don't know what to say.
It's outstanding.
You have to call me.
Hey, how you doing?
This is Gary calling from Irene Fox's office.
You answered our ad in the paper for the editor position?
Irene was really impressed with your résumé and would love to meet you ASAP.
Yes!
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.
Ow.
Oh, you too.
You just relax, sit down, hon.
Okay.
What a cute blazer, I love it.
I just wanted to say how excited I am to meet you and as much as I'd love the opportunity to be an in-house editor, what I really wanna do is be a filmmaker.
Oh, no, I know.
I saw your student film, it was very impressive.
You watched it?
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
You have just this incredible female point of view, which is really gonna be a plus on Jeff's movie.
Jeff?
Jeff Drake.
The director you'll be working with.
Oh.
You've never heard of him?
I'm really embarrassed to say that I haven't.
How many films has he directed?
Oh, not that many lately.
I'm gonna say four this year.
This year?
Mmm.
Wow, that's incredible.
What's his best-known movie?
"Charlie's Anals. " "Charlie's Angels"?
No!
Honey, you're cute.
No, "Charlie's Anals. "
Shipped 20,000 copies last month.
Uh... uh...
Oh.
Uh... oh.
Uh... oh!
Oh, oh, oh, uh...
This is- this is- this is- um...
I'm
- I'm
- I'm-
This is a huge mistake, because I answered this ad in the "Daily Variety,"
which said, "Up-and-coming production company seeks self-starters for a challenging editing position. "
Well, we are up-and-coming.
I didn't mean it...
I didn't realize that this was a porn-
No- uh, we do not use the "P" word here, honey.
The "P" word is passé.
It's adult entertainment.
Look, every single applicant I've interviewed for this job thinks it's a nine-to-five jack fest.
I want someone with real filmmaking talent.
You are a smart, young woman with an accessible point of view.
That's invaluable if we're gonna make it into the mainstream.
Don't get me wrong, nobody shoots sex better than Jeff Drake, trust me.
But he's a little out of touch with his romantic side.
And romance, that's what we need if we're gonna pull in the female demographic and make it onto the big screen.
It's gonna be on the big screen?
In the top art-house markets.
Los Angeles, New York, Miami.
Miami- great.
My parents could see it.
Oh, good.
Look, I've...
I've never even seen a porn-
Hey, no "P"-
Adult film.
Fabulous.
You'll have the fresh perspective we're so desperately in need of.
Why don't you keep it overnight, check it out, and I want your answer first thing in the morning.
All right.
Thanks, Jody.
Hi, this is Jody Balaban calling for Garry Marshall.
It's a matter of grave importance.
He's not available.
Can I take a message?
Ahh!
God, I would have loved to have seen your face, though, at a porn company?
Little Miss Virgin lost in a bay of pigs.
I'm not a virgin.
Excuse me, when a girl's genitals become petrified, she's reclassified a virgin.
Beats sleeping with my married boss.
That's getting tired.
At least I'm willing to make a sacrifice for my art.
Sound familiar?
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
So am I, you know?
I should just take that job at the porn company.
Even edit my movie there.
What movie?
Hey, you must be Jody.
I'm Gary.
I'm gonna be your tour guide here at Grind and I figured we'd start at the editing room.
It's this way.
I'm actually head of tech support.
So, you know, if you need some technical help,
I would be...
the technical guru.
Well, I haven't actually accepted the job yet.
Right, yes, I know, so...
Of course.
This is just one of our small editing rooms.
This is not locked.
Well, here it is.
That's our logo.
Pretty cool, right?
Well, I hope you take the job.
Actually be nice to have a pretty face like yours working here.
Thanks.
One that doesn't have a freakishly large penis jammed into it.
Oh, fuck me, that just popped out.
I'm so sorry, that was so terribly inappropriate.
Oh, fucking, just beat me with a baseball bat at this moment.
It's okay, it's okay.
I didn't mean to say that to you.
It's okay.
Thank you so much for the tour, but I really have to get going.
Why don't you just at least see the soundstage?
There's a soundstage?
We have a soundstage, yeah.
It's down this way.
Well, this is it.
Just shot "Gladiator" here.
He shot "Gladiator" here?
Uh...
Yeah, no, it's...
"Glad He Ate Her. "
Vagina.
I know, it's not-
Anyway, this was actually just a warehouse 'til Irene took over, now it's one of the busiest soundstages in town.
They actually shot 200 movies this year alone.
It's like a few movies a week.
If you can imagine...
Action.
Action, action, action.
Cut!
If you imagine it, y'know, they probably shot it here.
There's a fridge filled with film stock in the back and lighting and sound.
The whole nine yards.
This place has everything we need.
I couldn't have planned it any better- it's perfect.
I'll edit their porno movies during the day...
Oh, my God.
...and make my movie at night.
What if we get caught?
We won't get caught.
If we shoot a few hours every night after everybody leaves the building, no one will ever have to know.
We could wrap the movie in under a month.
An editing job?
Oh, honey, I'm so happy for you.
I knew if you would call Garry Marshall-
I knew that would be the answer.
And full benefits, you said?
I got everything.
Even a parking space.
It's about time you have a respectable job, Jody.
Something worthy of your talents.
Honey, what else has the company done?
Because you know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna rent every movie they ever did from Blockbuster.
No, you can't.
They're an up-and-coming company.
They're just getting off the ground.
Even better.
You'll grow with the company.
It's like I've always said.
Just because it's Hollywood doesn't mean you have to sell your soul.
All you need are talent and connections, then you can look any producer square in the eyes and tell him with dignity to-
"Fuck me in the ass!
Harder, harder, oh, baby!"
Who's line is it?
Oh, oh...
"Oh, yeah, take that black dick.
You like that big black fucking dick?"
Yo, idiot, that's my line.
Yeah, you just slap my ass.
Where does it say that?
Stage directions, Dick.
They're called stage directions.
Oh.
Okay, right here.
Okay, Jody, why don't you read those for us.
Me?
Yeah, right here.
Thank you.
Uh... okay.
"He grunts as he spreads her wet...
He inserts his rock-hard cock... "
You know what, I'm just the editor.
Can she read them?
You'll have that by Thursday.
Oh, hi, guys.
Marty's just finished the new draft of the script.
Hopefully you can have it all memorized by Monday.
Monday?
Uh-huh.
I'd rather throw in a DP for free.
DP.
That's director of photography, right?
The double penetration.
What's a double...
Yeah.
Yes!
ATM is still in here.
Please tell me that ATM is automated teller machine.
It is, it is, yeah.
It's also "ass to mouth. "
Okay, there we go.
Hot!
The coffee's just really hot.
I thought it was rather tepid.
Hey, everyone.
Jeff!
Hey, Jeff.
Sindi.
You must be my new editor.
Oh, yes, Jeff, this is Jody, your new right hand, huh?
Oh, fantastic.
Hi.
Hi.
Ha!
Jody, you don't wanna be his right hand.
Maybe she does.
Okay, before it gets gross, I'm gonna go.
Have a good read.
All right, everyone, let's read that new scene.
"Oh, baby you're giving me a hard attack-"
No.
Dress.
No, okay, dress, sorry.
"Oh-
"Ooh, ooh, baby.
That dress is giving me a hard attack. "
Maybe no is my dress.
Maybe it's my body.
I cur-vacuous girl.
Not "vacuous. "
"Vaceous," curvaceous.
What mean "vacuous"?
It means you're vacuuming.
Oh, God, this piece of shit!
I mean, come on, Marty.
Really, is this the best you can do?
"Hard attack"?
I mean, how many times do I have to tell you, we're not making another wall-to-wall piece of crap?
We're making a movie.
A movie to play in a movie theater.
Do you know the difference, Marty?
Yeah, the viewer can't fast-forward to the fucking.
Oh, that's funny.
You just threw my scripts in the trash.
Marty, you're fired.
Who the hell do you think you are, Drake?
Orson fucking Welles?
Y'know, go fuck yourself.
And fuck your little fantasy about making a real movie with this pathetic bunch of clowns.
Get the fuck out of here!
Hey, I heard you went to Dartmouth.
I went to MIT.
How do people like us end up here?
Ah, yes, it would be Karma.
I spent my entire adolescence whacking off to porn and now-
I know I'd rather watch gall bladder surgery on Discover.
Not to whack off to.
No, that would- that would be gross.
I don't do that.
You're over here, so...
I believe you.
Oh, this is my editing room.
It's pretty sweet, right?
Only the best for my new editor.
Gary, you mind giving us a minute?
Yeah, you got it, pal.
Have a seat.
Irene showed me your student film and I loved it.
Especially the writing.
Thank you.
I have a proposition for you.
You help me rewrite Marty's piece-of-shit script, and I will double your salary.
What do you say?
Irene hired me as an editor.
Yeah, now you've been promoted.
You'll be my editor and my writer.
I really don't think I'm gonna have the time.
No, listen, this could be a huge opportunity for you.
I want this film to be released in an art house.
It's a movie about a bride who willingly gets gangbanged before her own wedding.
That's true, that is true.
Good writing will legitimize it, get people to pay attention.
But in the meantime, I need to make sure you can handle cutting hard-core.
What's this?
That's the star of my movie, Bliss.
It's a trial run of her opening.
I think of that as a little test drive for my editor.
Fine.
What's to test?
Fuck me, you little piece of shit!
Yeah, I'm gonna come!
Oh, the hell you are!
You don't make me come first,
I'm gonna yank your little dick off.
Oh, my God.
You want it, Bliss, huh?
Yeah.
I'm gonna give it to you, you dirty, little fucking slut!
I am a dirty fucking slut!
You're a slut.
You're a slut.
Jody is a slut.
Remember junior high, dreaming about Bobby Daples?
Even then your little hoo-ha was on fire.
Oh, no, I'm thinking about Bobby's pee-pee during my own Bat Mitzvah.
It's fucking priceless.
Now look at you.
Hiding behind your work so you don't have to deal with the sweaty complications of real life.
Just remember, wherever you go, there you are.
Oh, Bliss, I'm gonna come!
Of course I have needs, but I'm not about to give my body over to some man who's only interested in me giving him a blow-
Okay!
Thank you so much.
That's- that'll be all.
How old was she, 12?
No.
How many more girls do we have left?
Reading for Katie?
Just one.
That's it?
Brandi Snow, why don't you come in?
Hi.
I love your script.
It's so funny.
Actually, I didn't write it, the director did.
She'll be in in a minute.
Do you wanna come in?
Okay.
Ow, what is your problem?
That's Sindi.
It's one of the porn stars from Grind.
Wait a second.
Brandi Snow is her real name and Sindi's her porn name?
Just read her and get her out of here.
Okay.
I'm gonna come.
On it, not in it!
Fucking slut!
Hey, I got you some coffee.
Thanks.
What'd you think of Bliss?
She is something else.
Yeah, yeah, she's a force of nature.
A woman who's totally in touch with her sexuality, no excuses, no apologies.
And you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
Here.
What's this?
Directions to my house.
I'm having a party tomorrow night before our first day of shooting.
I'd like for you to come up and get to know the talent as people, not just scary sex machines.
Thanks for asking, but I can't.
Oh, I'm not asking.
I'm highly suggesting.
Just ignore how handsome Jeff is when you see him, okay?
We only have to stay for a couple of minutes.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me, don't I know you?
Oh, no, I don't think so, no.
Did we do that strap-on scene in Brad's kitchen last week?
No.
Wait, wait, you- you're that girl I auditioned for.
Oh, right.
What is she doing here?
Kathleen is my best friend.
We went to film school together.
You- you have to read her script.
It is so awesome.
You really think so?
Yeah, I mean, I know I'm not right to play Katie, but what I wouldn't give to be in that movie.
You wanna be a real actress?
It's been my dream since- since I was a kid.
So then why are you doing porn?
'Cause it's tough trying to make it in Hollywood.
It's not like I'm gonna do it forever.
And then I have this hot body, so it's like God telling me to do porn.
You just have to believe in yourself.
That's what my mom always tells me.
I love this song.
I gotta go, bye!
Shake it, girl!
I'm gonna go find the bathroom.
Oh, God, hurry.
So we all came in a martini glass and then the chick swallows it.
She takes the olive and then she bites down on that.
And that's the end of the movie.
I've been dating that girl from the 101 and I just-
I don't even know if I like her.
I don't know- how can I tell?
You know what I do?
If I really like a chick...
I jack off to her.
I think all kind of little nasty shit that I wanna do to her, just the prolonged one, not the quickie one, and then when I nut, if I still have any sense of emotion for her,
I call her.
What happens after you nut if all you wanna do is text her?
It's about time you got here.
Is this yours?
Hell, no, that's- that's Jeff Drakowski's.
You're Jeff Drakowski?
The Jeff Drakowski that directed "Mystic Shadows"?
You might be one of ten people who's actually seen that movie.
I love that movie.
It's full of so much nuanced Romanticism and harsh social insights, it-
It's a pretentious piece of crap that couldn't pay my phone bill.
But thanks for the compliment.
Art isn't about making profit.
It's about making a human connection.
Fuck art.
Porn is about making a human connection.
How can you say that?
Aren't you just romanticizing your cynicism?
You'll understand after a few months of Grind, believe me.
I'm not gonna be there that long.
Then why'd you take the job?
Come on, Balaban, you can tell me.
Why are you really working at Grind?
You're supposed to say to work alongside the great Jeff Drake.
All that nuanced Romanticism crap.
Enjoy the party.
Americans have such fascination with asshole.
I know one girl, she fit two men and one cucumber in her butt.
How do you call this?
When a guy pull out and hole stay open like this?
It's called gaper, yes?
Oh, thank God.
Where were you?
I can't believe I know what a gaper is.
Jeff Drake is Jeff Drakowski.
Who?
Jeff Drakowski.
You remember that amazing film that Emerich showed at orientation, "Mystic Shadows"?
Are you sure it's the same guy?
Yes.
Jody, hey, you made it.
Who's your pretty friend?
That's terribly tacky- I just said that, didn't I?
I'm sorry, I didn't wanna say you were pretty.
Not that you're not pretty, I think you're very-
I'm still doing it right as I speak to you?
Someone, if you have a baseball bat, now is the time.
Gary.
Yes.
This is my best friend Kathleen.
Kathleen, Gary.
Hello, I'm Gary.
She just said that twice.
Now it's three times.
Hi.
Hi, Gary.
Pleasure.
It's very nice to meet you.
You, too.
So, hey, should we get going?
You guys should go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jody, it's totally cool.
I'm very used to rejection, that's why I sleep with hookers.
What?
Yes, it's true.
I lost my virginity to a hooker and it's been about 500 bucks a month ever since.
And I just said that to both of you.
Well, I totally relate.
I lost my virginity to my best friend's stepdad, and it's been a series of married assholes ever since.
Really?
Can I freshen your drink up?
You wanna have another one?
I don't know, I'm just talking out loud again.
Okay.
Great, Jody, you-
Thank you, okay.
And whenever you're ready.
Ted was the one I waited for.
He betrayed me.
But worse than that, he betrayed my idea of romantic love.
Richard, I can't have sex with you.
Katie, just say yes.
No.
Oh, my God, that was amazing.
You guys were awesome.
Making a movie!
Hi, honey.
Okay, tell me, has there been any reaction to the script?
Actually, I'm pretty close to getting it made.
Oh, honey, I'm so excited-
Oh.
APS!
I think I have a delivery.
Okay, I'll hang on.
I'm gonna call you right back.
Where's Jeff?
I can't believe he sent a basket of dildos into my apartment.
Jeff!
Shh, what are you doing?
It's the first day of Jeff's movie.
Come on.
Cut!
That's one hour for lunch, guys.
Let's make sure we clean up the set.
Great first day, everyone.
Sindi, no beans.
No beans at lunch.
See you tomorrow, Jeff.
Oh, I see you got my gift basket.
Is...
little Jody Balaban all set for her first day at school?
That's not funny.
I'll check in with you later.
Hey.
Thanks for introducing me to Kathleen.
I'm so glad that it worked out.
It did.
You know, she's actually the first normal girl
I've dated since high school.
I mean, she's still gonna run me like 500 bucks a month but at least I get dinner and a movie with my load.
That is an awful thing to say.
"I owe you" is really- is all I really wanted to say.
I'll see you in a bit.
Irene.
Gary.
Oh, hey, how's the footage looking?
I am just about to get started.
Excellent.
Y'know, I think you and Jeff are gonna make a great team.
By the way, I want you to come to me and tell me what you think.
I really respect your opinion.
Okay, Irene, I actually have a question.
Sure.
Don't you ever have any issues with working here?
No.
So paying women to have sex doesn't bother you?
Well, I pay men, too.
Actually, I pay the men a lot less than
I pay the women, but shh.
Action.
Oh, that's fabulous, Bliss.
Baby...
Come on, I want it more.
Come on, I want it more.
I love it, baby.
Give it to me.
Oh, come on, baby.
Come on, I want it more.
More, baby.
I love it, baby.
Yes!
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
All right, Bliss, oh, that's great.
Now touch yourself.
Not so hard.
Lick your lips.
That's right, excellent.
Spread your legs.
Go ahead, Balaban, touch yourself.
I know you want to.
Really...
fantastic.
Oh, you're so sexy.
That's right, touch yourself.
Oh!
I'm proud of you, baby.
You're finally letting yourself enjoy this.
I'm not enjoying myself.
I feel so pathetic.
You're hardly pathetic.
Come on.
Starting tonight you're gonna be making your own movie.
Yeah, and look at the price I have to pay.
Shh, shh!
Hey, Jody, where do we go?
Shh, around the back!
Come and get us!
Wait, Kathleen, are we not supposed to be here?
Of course not.
We just don't wanna wake up the neighbors.
"On the Virge," take one.
Roll sound, rolling.
Marker.
Action!
Richard, if you love me, you'll wait.
A relationship isn't just about sex.
It's okay, Katie.
I'll never give up on you.
And cut!
That was awesome, that was so great!
Ready?
Next set up, let's move.
Are we still rolling?
Action!
Roll sound, rolling.
Action!
Oh, I love it!
Action!
"On the Virge. "
All right, come on, people, let's go.
We're behind schedule, keep moving, keep moving.
Roll sound.
Action.
Action.
And cut!
Jesus, Jody, this is our fucking craft services?
We work on your movie for free and you can't even get us a lousy fruit platter?
Who's this fucking guy?
And here I thought I'd surprise you, Jody.
I gotta admit, Jody.
I am impressed by your-
Oh, what is that word I'm looking for?
Gall... audacity.
How about perseverance?
No.
No.
Unfortunately for you, honey,
I run a business, not a film school.
You are so lucky I'm not gonna fire your sneaky ass.
Wanna know why?
Because you know how hard it is to be a woman in this business?
No, that's a good one.
I love- no.
Because you're gonna rewrite Jeff's movie.
Gratis.
That means for free.
Oh, and one more thing.
From now on, you pay for your own film stock.
I can't afford to pay for my own...
You're gonna let me shoot my movie here.
We got "Fat Fanny's Fannies" coming in at the end of the month- you've got three weeks.
Thank you so much!
At least we won't have to be sneaking our actors in and out, right?
What actors?
The ones that ran like the wind the second they realized this was a porn studio?
How did they find out?
I don't know, maybe it was the butt plug Angie sat on.
Hey, hey!
Hi!
Do you have my bag?
Jody?
Jody?
The thing is, we can only shoot at night and on the weekends, so you have to be able to balance your schedule with Jeff's movie during the day.
Oh, my God.
No problem.
Now you're gonna have two scripts to memorize so that means cutting out pretty much all of your extracurricular activities.
You mean like carbs and stuff?
Jody.
What are you doing?
Whatever it takes.
Holy shit, Jody.
These people can't act.
Especially in a film about a virgin holding out for her wedding night.
You said yourself that Sindi was really good.
Okay, well, what about the other two castaways from the SS Suck and Fuck?
Don't be mean.
We don't have a Katie.
Who's gonna play your virginal lead?
We'll place another ad.
You think you're gonna get a real actor to play alongside these freaks?
Look, I'm not blowing Joel anymore, okay?
Which means that I have to be super sharp at work, which means that I can't work all day and stay up all night producing a film starring people who think that "character depth"
is a vaginal reference.
That's a lucky pickle.
If you can't do it, I understand.
But I have one chance... and I'm gonna take it.
All right, we start rehearsing tonight, and then the second we find our Katie, we start shooting.
I'll put a casting session together for tomorrow.
This is gonna take a miracle.
You're sure you wanna do this?
Hey.
Come on in.
Okay, so after the Jacuzzi scene,
Dick should just say to Bliss, really vulnerable,
"I've never loved anyone like this before. "
No.
Why not?
They just had great sex.
No man should ever tell a woman that he loves her after the first time they've had sex, okay?
It's not his truth.
He's in some sort of state of euphoria.
That's not love.
Maybe in your world.
Yes, the real one.
Well, then what world do I live in?
The not-real one.
This is why we can't write together.
Look, he just needs to say something unexpected.
You know, not some sort of saccharine-laced sweet cliché.
Since when has saying "I love you" been a cliché?
Look, get over him, Balaban, okay?
Who?
The guy who treated you so badly you think every penis is a loaded gun aimed straight at your heart.
Is that a line you want in the script?
Because if it is, don't you think it's a little bit obvious?
I'm just hoping a little honesty will inspire you to write from your heart, that's all.
Blackmail gets you my time and my skill.
Not my heart.
I'll polish this turd, that's it.
All right, okay.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna take a Jacuzzi.
Why, what were you expecting?
Sure you won't join me?
Do you have a certificate of disinfection?
What is that supposed to mean?
Like, how many girls have I done in here?
How about you, Balaban?
Why aren't you dating anyone?
I work 9:00 to 5:00 watching people sit on each other's faces.
What am I gonna talk about on a date?
How to get ass-cheek impressions off of your chin?
That would definitely break the ice.
I just wanna say how much I appreciate all of you guys being here and committing to this project, and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask me, okay?
I'm so excited!
I have question.
You say Katie no have sex, but then you say she "sell butt. "
No, I wrote that she's celibate.
It means that she doesn't have sexual intercourse.
Oh, only in the ass.
You don't have to worry about it, Kato, okay?
Mila.
My real name Mila.
Kato is porn name.
Okay, Mila.
If it's better, you call me by my character name.
Janet, okay?
Yeah, Janet.
I'd like to be called by my character's name.
Richard.
Isn't "Dick" short for "Richard"?
Whose dick is short?
No, dummy, the nickname.
No.
Dick Short's not a good nickname in our line of work.
Jody, I think we found our Katie.
Okay, I'll be right back, guys.
Maybe go over your lines together?
Oh, awesome.
Okay.
Um, all right, you start.
Ted was it.
The one I waited 21 years for.
And he betrayed me.
But worse... he betrayed my idea of romantic love.
That was amazing.
Oh, thanks.
We just have one question for you, Laura.
Sure.
How would you feel if we told you that we were shooting this at an adult-film company?
Like a porn company?
No, the "P" word is passé.
It's an adult-entertainment company.
And we're not shooting for one, we're shooting at one, and that's just because we got a great deal on their equipment.
Gosh, I mean, it's not really my first choice, honestly, but...
I really need this shot.
Great!
We start tonight.
So I got the part?
Yes.
"A" mark.
Action.
Richard, if you love me, you'll wait.
A relationship isn't just about sex.
I promise you, once I'm ready to give myself to you, you will have me forever.
It's okay, Katie.
I'll never give up on you.
But one day, you'll have to learn to thrust me.
Cut.
Okay.
It's "trust me," not "thrust me. "
Shit!
It's okay.
We're working on my movie now, not Jeff's.
Sorry.
Take five, everyone.
You know, you did such a great job.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, I'm so glad you said that.
I was so worried that I was playing Katie a little too... indecisive.
Why would you think that?
Well, because she's just so in touch with her feelings and with herself and the way she can control her desires, even with the right guy.
She doesn't know that Richard's the right guy yet.
That's why she's holding out to sleep with him.
You know, it's a trust issue for her.
But hasn't she known Richard for years?
Yeah.
Oh.
So you're saying that Katie's trust issues are with herself.
Huh.
You're brilliant.
So I just saw your cut of the wedding orgy and you stay on the faces about 90% of the time.
That 90% is what's gonna get this film out of the outhouse and into the art house.
No, that 90% is what's gonna send men running out of the theater, demanding a refund.
Now, the first rule in cutting adult film is no reactions to the action, okay?
The only faces I wanna see are either buried in a bush or impaled on a cock.
That's so charming.
Mmm.
You're sending me mixed messages here.
I thought you hired me because you wanted to raise the bar.
I do.
I just don't wanna lose my hard-on reaching for it.
It's not about your hard-on.
It's about giving women what they need.
What they need is an emotional connection and plot and character and story, not some sort of onslaught of gynecological close-ups where you don't know whose tits go with what ass.
Okay.
Look, I agree.
The story is important- it is.
And you're doing a great job, but it's still an adult film, and at the end of the day, the sex... is inevitable.
I agree.
It's just that women need an emotional connection to get turned on.
Mmm.
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?
To see if this is true.
What?
That women need an emotional connection to be turned on.
Oh, I don't wanna go in there!
Yes, you do.
And you are gonna watch me shoot all day long if that's what it's gonna take for me to get through to you, okay?
All right.
Got it?
I want it.
Give it to me, Bliss.
Oh, you're so fucking hot.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, God, I'm coming!
Oh, oh, oh...
Excellent, that's a cut.
That's a cut.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Hey, Jode.
I just wanna tell you how stoked I am that you gave me a chance to be in your flick.
You're welcome.
Sorry about the chubby.
Marker.
Can you feel me?
Do you feel Jake, baby?
Huh, do you feel me, baby?
Tell me how you feel!
Come on, tell Jake how you feel, baby!
Tell me you feel it!
Tell me!
Yo, what the fuck?
Come on, baby!
Come on!
12 inches.
What the fuck is going on?
God damn it.
Starting tonight, you work around my schedule, all right?
I don't want you using any performer that works for me the next day.
Is that funny, is that funny?
No.
You think that's funny?
No.
Well, good, I'm glad you suddenly have the night free, 'cause we have an ending to write.
Cancel your shoot tonight.
So I'll tell you what's not working for me.
We have a move about a bride who screws the entire guest list before her wedding and her husband's, like, totally cool with it.
I think Dick should be really torn up about it.
He really- he really loves Bliss.
What do you think?
Well, I think you type a lot faster without that huge rock on your finger.
Where is it?
Why aren't you wearing it?
It was my grandmother's engagement ring.
And I sold it at a pawn shop to pay for my film stock.
You're kidding.
Well, I admire your passion.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go use your restroom.
What are you reading?
I'm reading your screenplay.
That's really private.
Well, so is my medicine cabinet.
I actually really liked it.
How many pages did you read, five?
I understand Katie's dilemma.
Not trusting men after being dumped by Ted.
Why risk heartbreak when the reward is so small?
The truth is, I think she's really just afraid that she's a lousy lay when that is most likely not the case.
She just... hasn't found the right match.
Where you going?
I have to put an end to this day.
But what about our ending?
I'm all blocked up.
¶ Good night my baby ¶
¶ You'll be sleeping ¶
¶ While I pray ¶
¶ The dark is fading ¶

Yo, Jody!
Jody, wake up!
It's me, wake up!
Ow!
Jody?
Wake up, Jody.
Hi.
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?
You forgot us meet rehearsal.
So you came all the way over here?
Look, Jody, this is really important to us and we need you to focus.
We're here to act.
Are you up for this?
Yeah, come in.
Okay, this part right here, where Katie still won't bone Richard, even though we know she's dying for it?
I don't get it.
That's called delayed gratification.
More like blue balls.
I'm sure, Sindi, there was some guy, right, and you really liked him, but you didn't want him to think that you were easy, so you played hard to get.
Katie really likes Richard.
She just thinks that things that are worthwhile are worth waiting for, that the struggle in life is what's exciting and that if Richard really proves that he really cares about her and waits... that then he's showing her her worth
and how special he thinks she is.
And then, she wants to give him everything.
Don't you wanna give a man everything?
I do.
Every day I do that.
That's because... you're so much more generous than she is.
She just... she's generous later.
You're freaking me out, Jode.
I mean, sex is awesome.
I can't believe I get paid to do it.
Yeah.
Charlie, cue.
Action.
Oh, yeah!
Holy shit.
Just like I suspected.
It was a dream.
A very wet dream, huh?
Shut up.
I can't.
You won't let me.
You won't let Jeff either.
That man has you pinned to a "T."
Of course, that's one of the reasons your falling for him, isn't it?
I wouldn't touch him with a 10-inch pole.
It's 10-foot pole, not inch.
No doubt the man is hung, but let's not go overboard.
Not that you'll ever find out.
Just you wait and see.
Hey.
Hey.
I watched the honeymoon gangbang last night, and I love how you cut to the men waiting for their turn.
I've never really seen it from that perspective before.
You liked it?
Yeah, it was hot.
I thought it was hot, too.
Not that my opinion matters.
Okay, Marilyn, you're done in there.
And I think I'm done, too.
You know how to do this stuff?
Yeah.
Good, okay.
Jode...
bye anyway.
What's with the wet spot?
What?
The wet spot on your pants?
I'm talking about your knee.
I skinned it when I fell out of bed this morning.
Well, let me get you a Band-Aid.
We have a little scraped-knee First-Aid kit here.
Okay.
Let's see what we got here.
Oh, yeah, that's a real doozy.
Thank you, Dr. Drake.
Or is it Drakowski?
It almost was Dr. Drakowski.
Yeah, no kidding.
UCLA, premed.
Let me guess, gynecology?
Wow, you're relentless.
So what happened between the world of MD and the world of DP?
Being a doctor was my dad's idea, so I abandoned that as soon as I could, and then there was a brief period as a hot independent filmmaker, which won me many awards, no jobs and a huge amount of debt,
which led me to my journey into the deep, dark underbelly of Hollywood, the porn industry, which wasn't all that different from Hollywood after all.
But none of that seemed to matter in the eyes of my father, who'd rather have me die in a car accident than become- how'd he put it?
A sleazy pornographer.
That's a pity.
You are so talented.
Jesus Christ, Balaban.
I mean, don't you get it?
No one cares.
No one gives a shit.
And you know what?
They can all go and kiss my fuckin' ass.
Because I've got the money they wanna spend and the girls they wanna f-
Thanks for the Band-Aid.
Where are you going?
If you must know, our alma mater is having a gathering for poor loser film-school alum like myself.
Guess my invitation must have been lost in the mail.
For a second there,
I was gonna invite you to go with me.
And be sneered at by a jury of my peers?
No thank you.
Great, I already see three guys
I went down on in film school.
That's nothing, I see like six girls I would have whacked off to before I met you.
Freak.
Slut.
Hi, could I have a glass of red wine, please?
Jody Balaban.
Professor Emerich!
Hi!
My...
God, you look fantastic.
How is that Best Film Award holding up?
It's good, it's on my coffee table.
You know, I called Mr. Marshall.
I told him to keep an eye out for you.
You know, I tried calling him and it's been really impossible.
Nothing is impossible, my dear.
Let's go to my room.
I'll call him right now.
Oh, Kathleen!
I'll be back!
Jody Balaban.
Hey, Brett.
How are you?
I'm good, how are you?
My agent's just set me up to direct a Nike commercial.
Can you believe it?
Well, it's a start, right?
Anyway, it's better than working the daily Grind.
Who told you?
It's a small town.
You do have to laugh at the irony, though.
The promising Jody Balaban cutting cock for a living.
I cannot fucking believe that you just did that.
You royal bitch.
Your highness.
I believe you've missed a spot.
Now, why don't we cut the part where I break your nose?
Now run along.
Unless you wanna direct your Nike commercial through a wired jaw.
What are you doing here?
Ah, morbid curiosity.
About who'd be here?
No.
About what you'd be wearing.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Jeff.
Hey, man.
What's he doing here?
Getting the hell out of here before-
Drakowski!
Professor Emerich.
I'm surprised to see you here.
How's the nut sack?
See, I kicked the good professor in the balls.
When was that?
Four years ago?
Drakowski wasn't keen on being called out for his great contributions to the cinematic world of porn.
Actually, I wasn't too keen on you hitting on my wife.
Well, apparently, the poor woman had no idea what kind of movies her husband actually made for a living.
Yes, but thankfully, you told her.
Such a waste, Drakowski.
Taking advantage of desperate women looking for work.
Kind of like using your credentials to fuck them in your hotel suite, Professor?
I'll be happy to tell Mr. Marshall you've made quite the career change.
Why don't you tell his secretary I say hello?
Here you go.
So she really didn't know you directed porn?
Yeah, it's true.
How is that possible?
I was too embarrassed to tell her that I couldn't make a living as a filmmaker, so I lied.
I mean, she was content believing I was making a half-million dollars a year doing industrials.
Well, what happened after she found out?
Well, naturally, she assumed I was lying about everything else, including fidelity.
Or so she told the judge.
But she's recovering nicely now in a house overlooking the Pacific.
I'm sorry, Jeff.
Thanks, Jody.
Are you looking for attention?
What kind of attention?
The kind you can relish rebuffing.
The kind where the slimy creature from the black Jacuzzi rises from the depths, starts to lower your strap, drooling over your innocent, pert breasts while he moves in for the fateful kiss... closer and closer... and closer.
I'm just kidding with you, Balaban.
You think I'm gonna prove you right about the big, bad porn director?
You think I'm gonna fall into that trap?
Come on, you gonna stay in there all night or we actually gonna get some work done?
I can't take these games anymore.
If you don't trust me, there's no point to even getting married.
I have to move on.
It's a cut!
So can we move on now?
I think I need another one.
Um... excuse me, can I talk to you a minute?
Of course.
I know Katie is supposed to put up a good fight and all, but when is enough enough?
Well, that's Katie's dilemma.
She really wants to sleep with Richard, but she doesn't want him to think that she's a slut.
Um... but she loves Richard and how is it if she's acting on her true desires, that that makes her a slut?
If she really, really wants to be intimate with him, why doesn't she?
She trusts him, she loves him.
She desires him.
Why can't she just be with him?
Jody, the camera's ready.
I'm gonna do a quick rewrite on the scene.
All right, let's rock and roll.
So I don't wanna have sex?
You do wanna have sex, but you want her to want you even more than you want her, and that's how you know that you're gonna get her, and she's going to give in.
You gotta play hard to get a little bit.
Okay?
That's not natural.
Rolling.
84 kilo, take five.
Action.
Are you looking for attention?
What- what kind of attention?
I don't know.
Maybe... this kind.
Or this kind.
I'm just playing with you, Katie.
Jeez.
You take everything so damn seriously.
Jody...
You may now kiss the bride.
See?
It was fine for you to be a slut.
I'm still marrying you.
Okay, everyone, that's a wrap!
That was hot, guys, that was so great.
No, thank you.
Hey, Jody.
Hi.
I got you a wrap present.
Dick, you shouldn't have.
I-
Please, I want you to.
I made it especially for you.
It's my dick.
In a box.
I'll treasure it forever.
And there's no balls on it, either.
It's just the shaft.
I don't need 'em.
Okay.
I'm so proud of you.
Really?
When I say this, this is the truest thing
I've ever said:
You're the best director I've ever worked with, and I've done over 400 movies.
Hey, Laura.
Thank you so much.
I couldn't have done this without you.
I don't know about that, but how do you think it'll turn out?
A lot different than the script I wrote, thanks to you.
Thank you, thank you so much.
Thank you for taking me seriously.
You're welcome.
No, I mean it.
To be given this chance, this opportunity, really means a lot to me and it's really special.
Thank you.
See you at the premiere.
¶ Don't really care ¶
¶ Who found who ¶
Hi, honey.
It's Mommy and Daddy to wish you a happy birthday.
We wish we could be there to celebrate.
We love you so much.
You call us- Hurry up.
Bye, sweetheart.
Do you think she had any idea?
Please, she doesn't even know we exist.
Surprise!
Sandwich!
Whose idea was this?
Who do you think, Balaban?
Happy birthday.
Aww.
Cheers.
Hey.
Hi.
So let's dance, huh?
Guys, thank you so much.
Blow out your cock!
Oh, my God.
Come on.
Why don't you make a wish?
!
Let's go upstairs.
I got a little surprise for you up on the roof.
¶ Give you a chance ¶
Here, put this on.
Cheers.
Hey, you know what, this-
Thank you.
Hey, how-
Whoa.
What are you thinking?
That I really wanna kiss you right now.
Well, if she's not here, then we'll just go back to the room.
Hello.
Hi.
Are you guys the fluffers?
No, we're the Balabans, Jody's parents.
She's with her new boyfriend.
Jody has a boyfriend.
Boyfriend, what?
Yeah, Jeff.
Jeff Drake.
Director.
Directed by Jeff Drake.
Jupiter, Mars, Uranus.
It's like a sci-fi thing.
Honey, let's go, let's keep walking.
We'll find her desk.
Could you do a scene with-
He's not out of his dressing room yet.
I think I'm going crazy.
I just saw my parents.
How was your flight?
Our- it was lovely.
We saw a terrific movie.
It's the- oh, a Ron Howard movie.
What's the name, what was it called, honey?
It's called "this is your fault. "
It's not anybody's fault.
Why does this have to be somebody's fault, Dad?
You tell me.
After you've paid four years of Ivy League tuition and two years of grad school for your daughter, who ends up-
What?
Getting a good job, working as an editor?
Some things aren't worth the sacrifice.
I'm not sacrificing anything.
I saw you with that-
What's his name?
The pornographer.
Jeff.
Look, I can imagine how this must seem to you, but you should have more faith in your daughter.
Would you?
If she wound up working at a place like this?
Oh, hell no, no.
In fact, I'd use this on her.
Except she kind of likes it.
Okay, okay, let's go.
He's kidding, he's kidding, he's kidding.
It's not funny.
That's not how you talk to my parents.
I'm sorry.
See, I didn't know how to speak to your parents because I didn't come here with any sort of preconceptions as to who they were.
All I know is I'm crazy about their daughter.
She's a little quick to judge, but no one's perfect.
What's your point?
We shouldn't be so quick to judge you?
What, is he kidding me?
A man is what a man does.
Come on.
Why did you have to antagonize them?
Why didn't you say anything?
Is it because a small part of you agrees with them?
Or a big part?
This was a horrible idea and I told you it was.
Okay, okay, I was wrong.
Is that what you wanted me to say, I'm wrong?
Yes!
But did you have to be so hard on her-
Mom, Dad, wait.
Look, he's not what you think.
He's really talented.
He's honest and he believes in me.
How can you be so naive, Jody?
That man could give a damn about you.
You're just a sweet, little detour from his jaded, perverted life.
And that's where it ends.
How can you not see that?
Dad, you're wrong.
Come on, let's go.
Mom.
Debra, get in the car.
Look at how happy she is.
What's wrong with being happy?
¶ And someday ¶
¶ My, my, my ¶
¶ I'll be your life... ¶
I took your advice, Balaban.
The one with the faces.
No.
No, I'm a little drunk.
And I would... good for you to take advantage of me.
If you're here to apologize, you're doing a good job.
¶ Lady ¶
¶ I'll make you change ¶
Jeff!
Fuck you.
Hey, stop, stop.
I thought that was you in there.
You must really think I'm stupid.
But I'm not.
I may be a loser at the dating game, but I had an Ivy League education.
Yeah, so your father boasted.
Not like most of the people here.
I didn't drop out of Fuck Me High at 16 to come to Grind to edit pussy and suck the director's dick.
I came to get what I needed and get out.
Stop.
Before you say something you might regret.
Like what?
Like maybe my dad was right?
Or was it your dad?
Jeff vs. Jody.
I didn't know who to root for.
Yeah?
You pulled it off.
I can't thank you enough, Irene.
No thanks necessary, honey.
I mean, I just watched the final cut of Jeff's movie.
Excellent work.
I really think it's gonna empower the female audience.
God, I'm such a genius for hiring you.
What did he say about it?
Jeff, I'm not sure.
You know, he's made himself kind of scarce this week, so...
Oh, your last check.
Here you go.
I hope you understand that I cannot let you edit your movie here.
Just with what's transpired with Jeff, it would be really bad business.
I understand.
God, it's such a shame you two didn't just fuck each other's lights out and get it over with.
Like that's the answer to all of life's problems.
It's the answer to some of the problems.
Some pretty big ones, honey.
I need to get laid.
Who is it?
I said, who the fuck is it?
I'm sorry, it's Jody Balaban.
I was the editor.
I know who you are.
You can come in.
You've done a nice job with Jeff's movie.
Most people just go for the gore and you actually entice before the payoff.
Maybe that's 'cause...
I think sex is something that's better off when it's earned.
Or maybe you're just a natural-born cock tease.
Hey, that's one of the best parts of being a woman.
That and being a mother.
You're a mother?
And a wife.
Married eight years.
One beautiful son.
That's crazy.
Does your husband know what you do?
Of course he knows what I do.
He financed my first movie.
What could I say?
He gets off watching me have sex with other men.
As long as it's him I make love to.
Hey, if there's one thing you can learn from working here at Grind, Jody, it's to each his own.
Or her own.
You know what's funny?
I had so many conversations with you in my head, but you're nothing like I expected.
You know what else is funny?
How much you respect Laura.
I'm a better actress than you thought, huh?
¶ Take a breath and close your eyes ¶
¶ Drifting in the sunlight ¶
¶ It's golden ¶
¶ And feel the rush of the tide ¶
¶ It feels like you're starting to fly ¶
¶ You float ¶
¶ There she goes ¶
¶ Where did she go?
¶
Oh, my God.
You look so beautiful.
I'm so excited.
¶ Before you crash into the skylight ¶
¶ You're flying ¶
¶ I hold my breath and close my eyes ¶
¶ The sunlight in the summertime ¶

If you love me, you'll wait.
A relationship isn't just about sex.

What- what kind of attention?

¶ Falling out of place ¶
¶ With little hope ¶

Please, call me anytime.
I would love to set up a meeting at our agency.
Thank you.
Great job, Jody!
Thanks.
Ooh!
What's the matter?
Nobody came.
Everybody came.
From Grind.
Well, what'd you expect?
I mean, they're probably out having their ass hairs waxed or something.
I am so glad your father didn't hear that.
Mom!
Oh!
Hey, Kathleen.
Oh, my baby girl.
I'm so glad you made it here.
I would not have missed this for the world.
Did Dad come?
Jody?
Oh, there's-
Hi.
Hey, hey.
Sindi.
Where were you sitting?
I was just-
Next to me.
You did a great job.
Yeah.
You too.
I can never figure this out.
I need to-
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you, Dad.
Well, I'm gonna go get a drink.
My daughter, my daughter.
So what'd you think?
You are so talented and everyone was awesome.
I can't wait to tell them.
Why didn't they come?
They're in Vegas.
Y'know, it's the AVN Awards tomorrow night.
Oh, the Adult Video Awards.
Yeah.
Right.
Well, Jeff's up for Best Director.
So that's exciting, right?
You guys know that I didn't really mean to hurt any of you, right?
And that I appreciate you so much.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm so sorry.
I don't remember anything about that night.
I was really wasted.
It really wasn't Jeff's fault, 'cause- 'cause he- he thought that I was you.
So you and Jeff never-
I wish.
We've all been trying to get in his pants for years.
I'm beginning to wonder if he can still get it up.
What do you mean?
Jeff hasn't been with a woman since his wife left him.
It's funny how it works in our business.
You gotta keep it a secret when you don't screw around.
Oh, God, I almost forgot.
This is for you.
Thanks.
Listen, I've got to catch my plane to Vegas, so...
I'll see you around, okay?
Okay.
I didn't open your present.
Oh, that's not from me.
It's from Jeff.
See you at the Oscars.
Live from Las Vegas, welcome to this year's AVN Awards.

Wicked, Vivid-
Grind.
Well... not anymore.
Can't let you in without an ID, sweet tits.
Hey, Bobby.
Hi, ladies.
Can't do it.
Hi.
About time.
You better get in there.
You're gonna miss Jeff's big speech.
They won't let me in.
Really.
And finally, for the Best Director nominees.
We have Ryan Raven for "Back-End Deal,"
Toby Shaft for "Hung Jury. "
And for the fifth time in a row,
Jeff Drake for "Finding Bliss,"
a film you can actually whack off to at an art-house theater near you.
And the winner is...
Jeff Drake!
Jeff!
Oh, wow, wow.
Thank you, thank you so much.
It's- it's always a thrill to be up here.
Let me start by thanking all the hardworking people at Grind.
I couldn't have done this without you.
Especially Irene Fox, who is my dear friend.
Well, I'd also like to thank the industry for the last time.
The adult world has been good to me, but it's time for me to move on.
Before I do, I'd like to say a special thanks to a very special woman.
I'd like to thank the star of my film, the one, the only...
Bliss.
Everyone, this is Jody.
She was my-
Editor.
And my- Cowriter.
And-
His self-righteous, cock-teasing... dildo-hiding-
You had me at cock-teasing.

All right, I want you to have a couple bites, all right?
I think that you need to focus more on your academics.
No, she did all her homework before dinner.
Dressing, honey?
Sure, thank you.
All right.
Sex has been a disaster for me my entire life.
Daddy?
Mm-hmm?
What's a blow job?
I couldn't say "blow job" for ten years after that.
Let alone give one.
But I could still wonder about it.
Especially if it had anything to do with
French-kissing Bobby Daples.
But even then, when it came to sex- total disaster.
By the time the bottle finally landed on Bobby, he must have watched me kiss over 100 boys.
I'm not kissing you.
You're a slut.
I didn't kiss another boy until my last year of college.
Promise it won't hurt?
No, no, honey, it's not gonna hurt at all.
Really?
Trust me.
It's gonna feel great.
You're gonna absolutely love this.
Okay.
Trust me.
I'm a little scared.
He dumped me the next day, and I finally accepted the harsh truth.
I sucked at sex.
Romance?
That was a whole other story.
I gotta go.
Oh, come on.
You're torturing me.
It's gonna be worth the wait.
Honestly, I knew it wasn't worth the wait for either one of us, but as long as I was in the power position,
I was happy.
But there was one place where love was honest, selfless and eternal.
It was the closest I could come to succeeding in love... and sex.
I didn't just fall in love with watching them,
I fell in love with making them.
I could rearrange reality the way I wanted... and it was addictive.
Jody, this has to be, hands down, the best fucking sex I've ever had.
I can't believe you're a virgin.
That's impossible.
Two years later, I was graduating from NYU Film School.
And now for our final award.
Mr. Marshall, if you please.
Professor Emerich, thank you.
This year's special award for Best Student Film goes to...
Jody Balaban.
Whoa, yes!
Jody, where are you?
Jody, wait!
That's Garry Marshall up there, okay?
Show him those lips are good for giving more than an acceptance speech.
"Pretty Woman," baby!
"Pretty Woman"!
Hi, here you go.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Hi, our friendly filmmaker.
Take a picture.
Who are these people?
Oh, those are my parents.
Ah, for the parents.
It was the best day of my life.
The day I knew I was destined to do great things.
Hi, it's Jody Balaban calling again for Mr. Marshall.
Sure, I can call back in six months, but I'd really like to-
After a year in LA,
I realized the closest I'd ever get to directing was directing traffic.
I just wanted to drop my résumé off.
He gave me the Best Student Film award.
This is crazy.
I've sent out hundreds of copies of my script, my film and my résumé.
I've spent more money on postage than I have on my rent.
Mr. Marshall's office.
Hi, it's Jody Balaban for Mr. Marshall.
Wait, didn't you call yesterday?
Yes, I called-
I'd answered ads for every job in this business and I can't get anyone to call me back.
Asshole!
That asshole was the one that hit me!
It was the fifth job I was fired from in a year.
But at least I still had my dignity.
Fuck!
So what'd you think?
It's even better than it was before.
Oh, really?
Yeah, really, really.
Jody, it's hilarious, but you have rewritten this thing 100 times and you are still the only one that's read it.
You gotta get it out there, you know?
You gotta get it read by somebody who matters.
I can't get anyone to return my calls.
You know that.
You have to network.
You have to go out and play the game.
I moved out here a month after you and I'm already working for Joel Metzger.
The hottest- Exec in town.
Yeah.
I know and that's different.
Why?
Because I wanna break into producing?
No, because you're blowing him.
I should just make the movie myself.
We could shoot it super low-budget.
"We"?
You said yourself, it's a great script.
Yeah, Jody, but be realistic.
How are you gonna afford camera, lights, a crew, sets?
I mean, you're broke.
I could sell my grandma's engagement ring.
That is a family heirloom.
Your parents would kill you.
All artists make sacrifices for their dreams.
Put your big dreams aside for a little while.
You're 24 years old.
Go on a date or something.
Good night, I love you.
I love you, too.
Who am I kidding?
I'd love some romance in my life, but I can't afford to lose my focus.
Not now.
I just needed one yes.
Someone who'd give me a chance.
You have one new message.
Hi, honey, it's Mom.
I just finished your screenplay.
Oh, I just- I don't know what to say.
It's outstanding.
You have to call me.
Hey, how you doing?
This is Gary calling from Irene Fox's office.
You answered our ad in the paper for the editor position?
Irene was really impressed with your résumé and would love to meet you ASAP.
Yes!
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.
Ow.
Oh, you too.
You just relax, sit down, hon.
Okay.
What a cute blazer, I love it.
I just wanted to say how excited I am to meet you and as much as I'd love the opportunity to be an in-house editor, what I really wanna do is be a filmmaker.
Oh, no, I know.
I saw your student film, it was very impressive.
You watched it?
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
You have just this incredible female point of view, which is really gonna be a plus on Jeff's movie.
Jeff?
Jeff Drake.
The director you'll be working with.
Oh.
You've never heard of him?
I'm really embarrassed to say that I haven't.
How many films has he directed?
Oh, not that many lately.
I'm gonna say four this year.
This year?
Mmm.
Wow, that's incredible.
What's his best-known movie?
"Charlie's Anals. " "Charlie's Angels"?
No!
Honey, you're cute.
No, "Charlie's Anals. "
Shipped 20,000 copies last month.
Uh... uh...
Oh.
Uh... oh.
Uh... oh!
Oh, oh, oh, uh...
This is- this is- this is- um...
I'm
- I'm
- I'm-
This is a huge mistake, because I answered this ad in the "Daily Variety,"
which said, "Up-and-coming production company seeks self-starters for a challenging editing position. "
Well, we are up-and-coming.
I didn't mean it...
I didn't realize that this was a porn-
No- uh, we do not use the "P" word here, honey.
The "P" word is passé.
It's adult entertainment.
Look, every single applicant I've interviewed for this job thinks it's a nine-to-five jack fest.
I want someone with real filmmaking talent.
You are a smart, young woman with an accessible point of view.
That's invaluable if we're gonna make it into the mainstream.
Don't get me wrong, nobody shoots sex better than Jeff Drake, trust me.
But he's a little out of touch with his romantic side.
And romance, that's what we need if we're gonna pull in the female demographic and make it onto the big screen.
It's gonna be on the big screen?
In the top art-house markets.
Los Angeles, New York, Miami.
Miami- great.
My parents could see it.
Oh, good.
Look, I've...
I've never even seen a porn-
Hey, no "P"-
Adult film.
Fabulous.
You'll have the fresh perspective we're so desperately in need of.
Why don't you keep it overnight, check it out, and I want your answer first thing in the morning.
All right.
Thanks, Jody.
Hi, this is Jody Balaban calling for Garry Marshall.
It's a matter of grave importance.
He's not available.
Can I take a message?
Ahh!
God, I would have loved to have seen your face, though, at a porn company?
Little Miss Virgin lost in a bay of pigs.
I'm not a virgin.
Excuse me, when a girl's genitals become petrified, she's reclassified a virgin.
Beats sleeping with my married boss.
That's getting tired.
At least I'm willing to make a sacrifice for my art.
Sound familiar?
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
So am I, you know?
I should just take that job at the porn company.
Even edit my movie there.
What movie?
Hey, you must be Jody.
I'm Gary.
I'm gonna be your tour guide here at Grind and I figured we'd start at the editing room.
It's this way.
I'm actually head of tech support.
So, you know, if you need some technical help,
I would be...
the technical guru.
Well, I haven't actually accepted the job yet.
Right, yes, I know, so...
Of course.
This is just one of our small editing rooms.
This is not locked.
Well, here it is.
That's our logo.
Pretty cool, right?
Well, I hope you take the job.
Actually be nice to have a pretty face like yours working here.
Thanks.
One that doesn't have a freakishly large penis jammed into it.
Oh, fuck me, that just popped out.
I'm so sorry, that was so terribly inappropriate.
Oh, fucking, just beat me with a baseball bat at this moment.
It's okay, it's okay.
I didn't mean to say that to you.
It's okay.
Thank you so much for the tour, but I really have to get going.
Why don't you just at least see the soundstage?
There's a soundstage?
We have a soundstage, yeah.
It's down this way.
Well, this is it.
Just shot "Gladiator" here.
He shot "Gladiator" here?
Uh...
Yeah, no, it's...
"Glad He Ate Her. "
Vagina.
I know, it's not-
Anyway, this was actually just a warehouse 'til Irene took over, now it's one of the busiest soundstages in town.
They actually shot 200 movies this year alone.
It's like a few movies a week.
If you can imagine...
Action.
Action, action, action.
Cut!
If you imagine it, y'know, they probably shot it here.
There's a fridge filled with film stock in the back and lighting and sound.
The whole nine yards.
This place has everything we need.
I couldn't have planned it any better- it's perfect.
I'll edit their porno movies during the day...
Oh, my God.
...and make my movie at night.
What if we get caught?
We won't get caught.
If we shoot a few hours every night after everybody leaves the building, no one will ever have to know.
We could wrap the movie in under a month.
An editing job?
Oh, honey, I'm so happy for you.
I knew if you would call Garry Marshall-
I knew that would be the answer.
And full benefits, you said?
I got everything.
Even a parking space.
It's about time you have a respectable job, Jody.
Something worthy of your talents.
Honey, what else has the company done?
Because you know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna rent every movie they ever did from Blockbuster.
No, you can't.
They're an up-and-coming company.
They're just getting off the ground.
Even better.
You'll grow with the company.
It's like I've always said.
Just because it's Hollywood doesn't mean you have to sell your soul.
All you need are talent and connections, then you can look any producer square in the eyes and tell him with dignity to-
"Fuck me in the ass!
Harder, harder, oh, baby!"
Who's line is it?
Oh, oh...
"Oh, yeah, take that black dick.
You like that big black fucking dick?"
Yo, idiot, that's my line.
Yeah, you just slap my ass.
Where does it say that?
Stage directions, Dick.
They're called stage directions.
Oh.
Okay, right here.
Okay, Jody, why don't you read those for us.
Me?
Yeah, right here.
Thank you.
Uh... okay.
"He grunts as he spreads her wet...
He inserts his rock-hard cock... "
You know what, I'm just the editor.
Can she read them?
You'll have that by Thursday.
Oh, hi, guys.
Marty's just finished the new draft of the script.
Hopefully you can have it all memorized by Monday.
Monday?
Uh-huh.
I'd rather throw in a DP for free.
DP.
That's director of photography, right?
The double penetration.
What's a double...
Yeah.
Yes!
ATM is still in here.
Please tell me that ATM is automated teller machine.
It is, it is, yeah.
It's also "ass to mouth. "
Okay, there we go.
Hot!
The coffee's just really hot.
I thought it was rather tepid.
Hey, everyone.
Jeff!
Hey, Jeff.
Sindi.
You must be my new editor.
Oh, yes, Jeff, this is Jody, your new right hand, huh?
Oh, fantastic.
Hi.
Hi.
Ha!
Jody, you don't wanna be his right hand.
Maybe she does.
Okay, before it gets gross, I'm gonna go.
Have a good read.
All right, everyone, let's read that new scene.
"Oh, baby you're giving me a hard attack-"
No.
Dress.
No, okay, dress, sorry.
"Oh-
"Ooh, ooh, baby.
That dress is giving me a hard attack. "
Maybe no is my dress.
Maybe it's my body.
I cur-vacuous girl.
Not "vacuous. "
"Vaceous," curvaceous.
What mean "vacuous"?
It means you're vacuuming.
Oh, God, this piece of shit!
I mean, come on, Marty.
Really, is this the best you can do?
"Hard attack"?
I mean, how many times do I have to tell you, we're not making another wall-to-wall piece of crap?
We're making a movie.
A movie to play in a movie theater.
Do you know the difference, Marty?
Yeah, the viewer can't fast-forward to the fucking.
Oh, that's funny.
You just threw my scripts in the trash.
Marty, you're fired.
Who the hell do you think you are, Drake?
Orson fucking Welles?
Y'know, go fuck yourself.
And fuck your little fantasy about making a real movie with this pathetic bunch of clowns.
Get the fuck out of here!
Hey, I heard you went to Dartmouth.
I went to MIT.
How do people like us end up here?
Ah, yes, it would be Karma.
I spent my entire adolescence whacking off to porn and now-
I know I'd rather watch gall bladder surgery on Discover.
Not to whack off to.
No, that would- that would be gross.
I don't do that.
You're over here, so...
I believe you.
Oh, this is my editing room.
It's pretty sweet, right?
Only the best for my new editor.
Gary, you mind giving us a minute?
Yeah, you got it, pal.
Have a seat.
Irene showed me your student film and I loved it.
Especially the writing.
Thank you.
I have a proposition for you.
You help me rewrite Marty's piece-of-shit script, and I will double your salary.
What do you say?
Irene hired me as an editor.
Yeah, now you've been promoted.
You'll be my editor and my writer.
I really don't think I'm gonna have the time.
No, listen, this could be a huge opportunity for you.
I want this film to be released in an art house.
It's a movie about a bride who willingly gets gangbanged before her own wedding.
That's true, that is true.
Good writing will legitimize it, get people to pay attention.
But in the meantime, I need to make sure you can handle cutting hard-core.
What's this?
That's the star of my movie, Bliss.
It's a trial run of her opening.
I think of that as a little test drive for my editor.
Fine.
What's to test?
Fuck me, you little piece of shit!
Yeah, I'm gonna come!
Oh, the hell you are!
You don't make me come first,
I'm gonna yank your little dick off.
Oh, my God.
You want it, Bliss, huh?
Yeah.
I'm gonna give it to you, you dirty, little fucking slut!
I am a dirty fucking slut!
You're a slut.
You're a slut.
Jody is a slut.
Remember junior high, dreaming about Bobby Daples?
Even then your little hoo-ha was on fire.
Oh, no, I'm thinking about Bobby's pee-pee during my own Bat Mitzvah.
It's fucking priceless.
Now look at you.
Hiding behind your work so you don't have to deal with the sweaty complications of real life.
Just remember, wherever you go, there you are.
Oh, Bliss, I'm gonna come!
Of course I have needs, but I'm not about to give my body over to some man who's only interested in me giving him a blow-
Okay!
Thank you so much.
That's- that'll be all.
How old was she, 12?
No.
How many more girls do we have left?
Reading for Katie?
Just one.
That's it?
Brandi Snow, why don't you come in?
Hi.
I love your script.
It's so funny.
Actually, I didn't write it, the director did.
She'll be in in a minute.
Do you wanna come in?
Okay.
Ow, what is your problem?
That's Sindi.
It's one of the porn stars from Grind.
Wait a second.
Brandi Snow is her real name and Sindi's her porn name?
Just read her and get her out of here.
Okay.
I'm gonna come.
On it, not in it!
Fucking slut!
Hey, I got you some coffee.
Thanks.
What'd you think of Bliss?
She is something else.
Yeah, yeah, she's a force of nature.
A woman who's totally in touch with her sexuality, no excuses, no apologies.
And you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
Here.
What's this?
Directions to my house.
I'm having a party tomorrow night before our first day of shooting.
I'd like for you to come up and get to know the talent as people, not just scary sex machines.
Thanks for asking, but I can't.
Oh, I'm not asking.
I'm highly suggesting.
Just ignore how handsome Jeff is when you see him, okay?
We only have to stay for a couple of minutes.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me, don't I know you?
Oh, no, I don't think so, no.
Did we do that strap-on scene in Brad's kitchen last week?
No.
Wait, wait, you- you're that girl I auditioned for.
Oh, right.
What is she doing here?
Kathleen is my best friend.
We went to film school together.
You- you have to read her script.
It is so awesome.
You really think so?
Yeah, I mean, I know I'm not right to play Katie, but what I wouldn't give to be in that movie.
You wanna be a real actress?
It's been my dream since- since I was a kid.
So then why are you doing porn?
'Cause it's tough trying to make it in Hollywood.
It's not like I'm gonna do it forever.
And then I have this hot body, so it's like God telling me to do porn.
You just have to believe in yourself.
That's what my mom always tells me.
I love this song.
I gotta go, bye!
Shake it, girl!
I'm gonna go find the bathroom.
Oh, God, hurry.
So we all came in a martini glass and then the chick swallows it.
She takes the olive and then she bites down on that.
And that's the end of the movie.
I've been dating that girl from the 101 and I just-
I don't even know if I like her.
I don't know- how can I tell?
You know what I do?
If I really like a chick...
I jack off to her.
I think all kind of little nasty shit that I wanna do to her, just the prolonged one, not the quickie one, and then when I nut, if I still have any sense of emotion for her,
I call her.
What happens after you nut if all you wanna do is text her?
It's about time you got here.
Is this yours?
Hell, no, that's- that's Jeff Drakowski's.
You're Jeff Drakowski?
The Jeff Drakowski that directed "Mystic Shadows"?
You might be one of ten people who's actually seen that movie.
I love that movie.
It's full of so much nuanced Romanticism and harsh social insights, it-
It's a pretentious piece of crap that couldn't pay my phone bill.
But thanks for the compliment.
Art isn't about making profit.
It's about making a human connection.
Fuck art.
Porn is about making a human connection.
How can you say that?
Aren't you just romanticizing your cynicism?
You'll understand after a few months of Grind, believe me.
I'm not gonna be there that long.
Then why'd you take the job?
Come on, Balaban, you can tell me.
Why are you really working at Grind?
You're supposed to say to work alongside the great Jeff Drake.
All that nuanced Romanticism crap.
Enjoy the party.
Americans have such fascination with asshole.
I know one girl, she fit two men and one cucumber in her butt.
How do you call this?
When a guy pull out and hole stay open like this?
It's called gaper, yes?
Oh, thank God.
Where were you?
I can't believe I know what a gaper is.
Jeff Drake is Jeff Drakowski.
Who?
Jeff Drakowski.
You remember that amazing film that Emerich showed at orientation, "Mystic Shadows"?
Are you sure it's the same guy?
Yes.
Jody, hey, you made it.
Who's your pretty friend?
That's terribly tacky- I just said that, didn't I?
I'm sorry, I didn't wanna say you were pretty.
Not that you're not pretty, I think you're very-
I'm still doing it right as I speak to you?
Someone, if you have a baseball bat, now is the time.
Gary.
Yes.
This is my best friend Kathleen.
Kathleen, Gary.
Hello, I'm Gary.
She just said that twice.
Now it's three times.
Hi.
Hi, Gary.
Pleasure.
It's very nice to meet you.
You, too.
So, hey, should we get going?
You guys should go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jody, it's totally cool.
I'm very used to rejection, that's why I sleep with hookers.
What?
Yes, it's true.
I lost my virginity to a hooker and it's been about 500 bucks a month ever since.
And I just said that to both of you.
Well, I totally relate.
I lost my virginity to my best friend's stepdad, and it's been a series of married assholes ever since.
Really?
Can I freshen your drink up?
You wanna have another one?
I don't know, I'm just talking out loud again.
Okay.
Great, Jody, you-
Thank you, okay.
And whenever you're ready.
Ted was the one I waited for.
He betrayed me.
But worse than that, he betrayed my idea of romantic love.
Richard, I can't have sex with you.
Katie, just say yes.
No.
Oh, my God, that was amazing.
You guys were awesome.
Making a movie!
Hi, honey.
Okay, tell me, has there been any reaction to the script?
Actually, I'm pretty close to getting it made.
Oh, honey, I'm so excited-
Oh.
APS!
I think I have a delivery.
Okay, I'll hang on.
I'm gonna call you right back.
Where's Jeff?
I can't believe he sent a basket of dildos into my apartment.
Jeff!
Shh, what are you doing?
It's the first day of Jeff's movie.
Come on.
Cut!
That's one hour for lunch, guys.
Let's make sure we clean up the set.
Great first day, everyone.
Sindi, no beans.
No beans at lunch.
See you tomorrow, Jeff.
Oh, I see you got my gift basket.
Is...
little Jody Balaban all set for her first day at school?
That's not funny.
I'll check in with you later.
Hey.
Thanks for introducing me to Kathleen.
I'm so glad that it worked out.
It did.
You know, she's actually the first normal girl
I've dated since high school.
I mean, she's still gonna run me like 500 bucks a month but at least I get dinner and a movie with my load.
That is an awful thing to say.
"I owe you" is really- is all I really wanted to say.
I'll see you in a bit.
Irene.
Gary.
Oh, hey, how's the footage looking?
I am just about to get started.
Excellent.
Y'know, I think you and Jeff are gonna make a great team.
By the way, I want you to come to me and tell me what you think.
I really respect your opinion.
Okay, Irene, I actually have a question.
Sure.
Don't you ever have any issues with working here?
No.
So paying women to have sex doesn't bother you?
Well, I pay men, too.
Actually, I pay the men a lot less than
I pay the women, but shh.
Action.
Oh, that's fabulous, Bliss.
Baby...
Come on, I want it more.
Come on, I want it more.
I love it, baby.
Give it to me.
Oh, come on, baby.
Come on, I want it more.
More, baby.
I love it, baby.
Yes!
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
All right, Bliss, oh, that's great.
Now touch yourself.
Not so hard.
Lick your lips.
That's right, excellent.
Spread your legs.
Go ahead, Balaban, touch yourself.
I know you want to.
Really...
fantastic.
Oh, you're so sexy.
That's right, touch yourself.
Oh!
I'm proud of you, baby.
You're finally letting yourself enjoy this.
I'm not enjoying myself.
I feel so pathetic.
You're hardly pathetic.
Come on.
Starting tonight you're gonna be making your own movie.
Yeah, and look at the price I have to pay.
Shh, shh!
Hey, Jody, where do we go?
Shh, around the back!
Come and get us!
Wait, Kathleen, are we not supposed to be here?
Of course not.
We just don't wanna wake up the neighbors.
"On the Virge," take one.
Roll sound, rolling.
Marker.
Action!
Richard, if you love me, you'll wait.
A relationship isn't just about sex.
It's okay, Katie.
I'll never give up on you.
And cut!
That was awesome, that was so great!
Ready?
Next set up, let's move.
Are we still rolling?
Action!
Roll sound, rolling.
Action!
Oh, I love it!
Action!
"On the Virge. "
All right, come on, people, let's go.
We're behind schedule, keep moving, keep moving.
Roll sound.
Action.
Action.
And cut!
Jesus, Jody, this is our fucking craft services?
We work on your movie for free and you can't even get us a lousy fruit platter?
Who's this fucking guy?
And here I thought I'd surprise you, Jody.
I gotta admit, Jody.
I am impressed by your-
Oh, what is that word I'm looking for?
Gall... audacity.
How about perseverance?
No.
No.
Unfortunately for you, honey,
I run a business, not a film school.
You are so lucky I'm not gonna fire your sneaky ass.
Wanna know why?
Because you know how hard it is to be a woman in this business?
No, that's a good one.
I love- no.
Because you're gonna rewrite Jeff's movie.
Gratis.
That means for free.
Oh, and one more thing.
From now on, you pay for your own film stock.
I can't afford to pay for my own...
You're gonna let me shoot my movie here.
We got "Fat Fanny's Fannies" coming in at the end of the month- you've got three weeks.
Thank you so much!
At least we won't have to be sneaking our actors in and out, right?
What actors?
The ones that ran like the wind the second they realized this was a porn studio?
How did they find out?
I don't know, maybe it was the butt plug Angie sat on.
Hey, hey!
Hi!
Do you have my bag?
Jody?
Jody?
The thing is, we can only shoot at night and on the weekends, so you have to be able to balance your schedule with Jeff's movie during the day.
Oh, my God.
No problem.
Now you're gonna have two scripts to memorize so that means cutting out pretty much all of your extracurricular activities.
You mean like carbs and stuff?
Jody.
What are you doing?
Whatever it takes.
Holy shit, Jody.
These people can't act.
Especially in a film about a virgin holding out for her wedding night.
You said yourself that Sindi was really good.
Okay, well, what about the other two castaways from the SS Suck and Fuck?
Don't be mean.
We don't have a Katie.
Who's gonna play your virginal lead?
We'll place another ad.
You think you're gonna get a real actor to play alongside these freaks?
Look, I'm not blowing Joel anymore, okay?
Which means that I have to be super sharp at work, which means that I can't work all day and stay up all night producing a film starring people who think that "character depth"
is a vaginal reference.
That's a lucky pickle.
If you can't do it, I understand.
But I have one chance... and I'm gonna take it.
All right, we start rehearsing tonight, and then the second we find our Katie, we start shooting.
I'll put a casting session together for tomorrow.
This is gonna take a miracle.
You're sure you wanna do this?
Hey.
Come on in.
Okay, so after the Jacuzzi scene,
Dick should just say to Bliss, really vulnerable,
"I've never loved anyone like this before. "
No.
Why not?
They just had great sex.
No man should ever tell a woman that he loves her after the first time they've had sex, okay?
It's not his truth.
He's in some sort of state of euphoria.
That's not love.
Maybe in your world.
Yes, the real one.
Well, then what world do I live in?
The not-real one.
This is why we can't write together.
Look, he just needs to say something unexpected.
You know, not some sort of saccharine-laced sweet cliché.
Since when has saying "I love you" been a cliché?
Look, get over him, Balaban, okay?
Who?
The guy who treated you so badly you think every penis is a loaded gun aimed straight at your heart.
Is that a line you want in the script?
Because if it is, don't you think it's a little bit obvious?
I'm just hoping a little honesty will inspire you to write from your heart, that's all.
Blackmail gets you my time and my skill.
Not my heart.
I'll polish this turd, that's it.
All right, okay.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna take a Jacuzzi.
Why, what were you expecting?
Sure you won't join me?
Do you have a certificate of disinfection?
What is that supposed to mean?
Like, how many girls have I done in here?
How about you, Balaban?
Why aren't you dating anyone?
I work 9:00 to 5:00 watching people sit on each other's faces.
What am I gonna talk about on a date?
How to get ass-cheek impressions off of your chin?
That would definitely break the ice.
I just wanna say how much I appreciate all of you guys being here and committing to this project, and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask me, okay?
I'm so excited!
I have question.
You say Katie no have sex, but then you say she "sell butt. "
No, I wrote that she's celibate.
It means that she doesn't have sexual intercourse.
Oh, only in the ass.
You don't have to worry about it, Kato, okay?
Mila.
My real name Mila.
Kato is porn name.
Okay, Mila.
If it's better, you call me by my character name.
Janet, okay?
Yeah, Janet.
I'd like to be called by my character's name.
Richard.
Isn't "Dick" short for "Richard"?
Whose dick is short?
No, dummy, the nickname.
No.
Dick Short's not a good nickname in our line of work.
Jody, I think we found our Katie.
Okay, I'll be right back, guys.
Maybe go over your lines together?
Oh, awesome.
Okay.
Um, all right, you start.
Ted was it.
The one I waited 21 years for.
And he betrayed me.
But worse... he betrayed my idea of romantic love.
That was amazing.
Oh, thanks.
We just have one question for you, Laura.
Sure.
How would you feel if we told you that we were shooting this at an adult-film company?
Like a porn company?
No, the "P" word is passé.
It's an adult-entertainment company.
And we're not shooting for one, we're shooting at one, and that's just because we got a great deal on their equipment.
Gosh, I mean, it's not really my first choice, honestly, but...
I really need this shot.
Great!
We start tonight.
So I got the part?
Yes.
"A" mark.
Action.
Richard, if you love me, you'll wait.
A relationship isn't just about sex.
I promise you, once I'm ready to give myself to you, you will have me forever.
It's okay, Katie.
I'll never give up on you.
But one day, you'll have to learn to thrust me.
Cut.
Okay.
It's "trust me," not "thrust me. "
Shit!
It's okay.
We're working on my movie now, not Jeff's.
Sorry.
Take five, everyone.
You know, you did such a great job.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, I'm so glad you said that.
I was so worried that I was playing Katie a little too... indecisive.
Why would you think that?
Well, because she's just so in touch with her feelings and with herself and the way she can control her desires, even with the right guy.
She doesn't know that Richard's the right guy yet.
That's why she's holding out to sleep with him.
You know, it's a trust issue for her.
But hasn't she known Richard for years?
Yeah.
Oh.
So you're saying that Katie's trust issues are with herself.
Huh.
You're brilliant.
So I just saw your cut of the wedding orgy and you stay on the faces about 90% of the time.
That 90% is what's gonna get this film out of the outhouse and into the art house.
No, that 90% is what's gonna send men running out of the theater, demanding a refund.
Now, the first rule in cutting adult film is no reactions to the action, okay?
The only faces I wanna see are either buried in a bush or impaled on a cock.
That's so charming.
Mmm.
You're sending me mixed messages here.
I thought you hired me because you wanted to raise the bar.
I do.
I just don't wanna lose my hard-on reaching for it.
It's not about your hard-on.
It's about giving women what they need.
What they need is an emotional connection and plot and character and story, not some sort of onslaught of gynecological close-ups where you don't know whose tits go with what ass.
Okay.
Look, I agree.
The story is important- it is.
And you're doing a great job, but it's still an adult film, and at the end of the day, the sex... is inevitable.
I agree.
It's just that women need an emotional connection to get turned on.
Mmm.
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?
To see if this is true.
What?
That women need an emotional connection to be turned on.
Oh, I don't wanna go in there!
Yes, you do.
And you are gonna watch me shoot all day long if that's what it's gonna take for me to get through to you, okay?
All right.
Got it?
I want it.
Give it to me, Bliss.
Oh, you're so fucking hot.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, God, I'm coming!
Oh, oh, oh...
Excellent, that's a cut.
That's a cut.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Hey, Jode.
I just wanna tell you how stoked I am that you gave me a chance to be in your flick.
You're welcome.
Sorry about the chubby.
Marker.
Can you feel me?
Do you feel Jake, baby?
Huh, do you feel me, baby?
Tell me how you feel!
Come on, tell Jake how you feel, baby!
Tell me you feel it!
Tell me!
Yo, what the fuck?
Come on, baby!
Come on!
12 inches.
What the fuck is going on?
God damn it.
Starting tonight, you work around my schedule, all right?
I don't want you using any performer that works for me the next day.
Is that funny, is that funny?
No.
You think that's funny?
No.
Well, good, I'm glad you suddenly have the night free, 'cause we have an ending to write.
Cancel your shoot tonight.
So I'll tell you what's not working for me.
We have a move about a bride who screws the entire guest list before her wedding and her husband's, like, totally cool with it.
I think Dick should be really torn up about it.
He really- he really loves Bliss.
What do you think?
Well, I think you type a lot faster without that huge rock on your finger.
Where is it?
Why aren't you wearing it?
It was my grandmother's engagement ring.
And I sold it at a pawn shop to pay for my film stock.
You're kidding.
Well, I admire your passion.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go use your restroom.
What are you reading?
I'm reading your screenplay.
That's really private.
Well, so is my medicine cabinet.
I actually really liked it.
How many pages did you read, five?
I understand Katie's dilemma.
Not trusting men after being dumped by Ted.
Why risk heartbreak when the reward is so small?
The truth is, I think she's really just afraid that she's a lousy lay when that is most likely not the case.
She just... hasn't found the right match.
Where you going?
I have to put an end to this day.
But what about our ending?
I'm all blocked up.
¶ Good night my baby ¶
¶ You'll be sleeping ¶

Yo, Jody!
Jody, wake up!
It's me, wake up!
Ow!
Jody?
Wake up, Jody.
Hi.
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?
You forgot us meet rehearsal.
So you came all the way over here?
Look, Jody, this is really important to us and we need you to focus.
We're here to act.
Are you up for this?
Yeah, come in.
Okay, this part right here, where Katie still won't bone Richard, even though we know she's dying for it?
I don't get it.
That's called delayed gratification.
More like blue balls.
I'm sure, Sindi, there was some guy, right, and you really liked him, but you didn't want him to think that you were easy, so you played hard to get.
Katie really likes Richard.
She just thinks that things that are worthwhile are worth waiting for, that the struggle in life is what's exciting and that if Richard really proves that he really cares about her and waits... that then he's showing her her worth
and how special he thinks she is.
And then, she wants to give him everything.
Don't you wanna give a man everything?
I do.
Every day I do that.
That's because... you're so much more generous than she is.
She just... she's generous later.
You're freaking me out, Jode.
I mean, sex is awesome.
I can't believe I get paid to do it.
Yeah.
Charlie, cue.
Action.
Oh, yeah!
Holy shit.
Just like I suspected.
It was a dream.
A very wet dream, huh?
Shut up.
I can't.
You won't let me.
You won't let Jeff either.
That man has you pinned to a "T."
Of course, that's one of the reasons your falling for him, isn't it?
I wouldn't touch him with a 10-inch pole.
It's 10-foot pole, not inch.
No doubt the man is hung, but let's not go overboard.
Not that you'll ever find out.
Just you wait and see.
Hey.
Hey.
I watched the honeymoon gangbang last night, and I love how you cut to the men waiting for their turn.
I've never really seen it from that perspective before.
You liked it?
Yeah, it was hot.
I thought it was hot, too.
Not that my opinion matters.
Okay, Marilyn, you're done in there.
And I think I'm done, too.
You know how to do this stuff?
Yeah.
Good, okay.
Jode...
bye anyway.
What's with the wet spot?
What?
The wet spot on your pants?
I'm talking about your knee.
I skinned it when I fell out of bed this morning.
Well, let me get you a Band-Aid.
We have a little scraped-knee First-Aid kit here.
Okay.
Let's see what we got here.
Oh, yeah, that's a real doozy.
Thank you, Dr. Drake.
Or is it Drakowski?
It almost was Dr. Drakowski.
Yeah, no kidding.
UCLA, premed.
Let me guess, gynecology?
Wow, you're relentless.
So what happened between the world of MD and the world of DP?
Being a doctor was my dad's idea, so I abandoned that as soon as I could, and then there was a brief period as a hot independent filmmaker, which won me many awards, no jobs and a huge amount of debt,
which led me to my journey into the deep, dark underbelly of Hollywood, the porn industry, which wasn't all that different from Hollywood after all.
But none of that seemed to matter in the eyes of my father, who'd rather have me die in a car accident than become- how'd he put it?
A sleazy pornographer.
That's a pity.
You are so talented.
Jesus Christ, Balaban.
I mean, don't you get it?
No one cares.
No one gives a shit.
And you know what?
They can all go and kiss my fuckin' ass.
Because I've got the money they wanna spend and the girls they wanna f-
Thanks for the Band-Aid.
Where are you going?
If you must know, our alma mater is having a gathering for poor loser film-school alum like myself.
Guess my invitation must have been lost in the mail.
For a second there,
I was gonna invite you to go with me.
And be sneered at by a jury of my peers?
No thank you.
Great, I already see three guys
I went down on in film school.
That's nothing, I see like six girls I would have whacked off to before I met you.
Freak.
Slut.
Hi, could I have a glass of red wine, please?
Jody Balaban.
Professor Emerich!
Hi!
My...
God, you look fantastic.
How is that Best Film Award holding up?
It's good, it's on my coffee table.
You know, I called Mr. Marshall.
I told him to keep an eye out for you.
You know, I tried calling him and it's been really impossible.
Nothing is impossible, my dear.
Let's go to my room.
I'll call him right now.
Oh, Kathleen!
I'll be back!
Jody Balaban.
Hey, Brett.
How are you?
I'm good, how are you?
My agent's just set me up to direct a Nike commercial.
Can you believe it?
Well, it's a start, right?
Anyway, it's better than working the daily Grind.
Who told you?
It's a small town.
You do have to laugh at the irony, though.
The promising Jody Balaban cutting cock for a living.
I cannot fucking believe that you just did that.
You royal bitch.
Your highness.
I believe you've missed a spot.
Now, why don't we cut the part where I break your nose?
Now run along.
Unless you wanna direct your Nike commercial through a wired jaw.
What are you doing here?
Ah, morbid curiosity.
About who'd be here?
No.
About what you'd be wearing.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Jeff.
Hey, man.
What's he doing here?
Getting the hell out of here before-
Drakowski!
Professor Emerich.
I'm surprised to see you here.
How's the nut sack?
See, I kicked the good professor in the balls.
When was that?
Four years ago?
Drakowski wasn't keen on being called out for his great contributions to the cinematic world of porn.
Actually, I wasn't too keen on you hitting on my wife.
Well, apparently, the poor woman had no idea what kind of movies her husband actually made for a living.
Yes, but thankfully, you told her.
Such a waste, Drakowski.
Taking advantage of desperate women looking for work.
Kind of like using your credentials to fuck them in your hotel suite, Professor?
I'll be happy to tell Mr. Marshall you've made quite the career change.
Why don't you tell his secretary I say hello?
Here you go.
So she really didn't know you directed porn?
Yeah, it's true.
How is that possible?
I was too embarrassed to tell her that I couldn't make a living as a filmmaker, so I lied.
I mean, she was content believing I was making a half-million dollars a year doing industrials.
Well, what happened after she found out?
Well, naturally, she assumed I was lying about everything else, including fidelity.
Or so she told the judge.
But she's recovering nicely now in a house overlooking the Pacific.
I'm sorry, Jeff.
Thanks, Jody.
Are you looking for attention?
What kind of attention?
The kind you can relish rebuffing.
The kind where the slimy creature from the black Jacuzzi rises from the depths, starts to lower your strap, drooling over your innocent, pert breasts while he moves in for the fateful kiss... closer and closer... and closer.
I'm just kidding with you, Balaban.
You think I'm gonna prove you right about the big, bad porn director?
You think I'm gonna fall into that trap?
Come on, you gonna stay in there all night or we actually gonna get some work done?
I can't take these games anymore.
If you don't trust me, there's no point to even getting married.
I have to move on.
It's a cut!
So can we move on now?
I think I need another one.
Um... excuse me, can I talk to you a minute?
Of course.
I know Katie is supposed to put up a good fight and all, but when is enough enough?
Well, that's Katie's dilemma.
She really wants to sleep with Richard, but she doesn't want him to think that she's a slut.
Um... but she loves Richard and how is it if she's acting on her true desires, that that makes her a slut?
If she really, really wants to be intimate with him, why doesn't she?
She trusts him, she loves him.
She desires him.
Why can't she just be with him?
Jody, the camera's ready.
I'm gonna do a quick rewrite on the scene.
All right, let's rock and roll.
So I don't wanna have sex?
You do wanna have sex, but you want her to want you even more than you want her, and that's how you know that you're gonna get her, and she's going to give in.
You gotta play hard to get a little bit.
Okay?
That's not natural.
Rolling.
84 kilo, take five.
Action.
Are you looking for attention?
What- what kind of attention?
I don't know.
Maybe... this kind.
Or this kind.
I'm just playing with you, Katie.
Jeez.
You take everything so damn seriously.
Jody...
You may now kiss the bride.
See?
It was fine for you to be a slut.
I'm still marrying you.
Okay, everyone, that's a wrap!
That was hot, guys, that was so great.
No, thank you.
Hey, Jody.
Hi.
I got you a wrap present.
Dick, you shouldn't have.
I-
Please, I want you to.
I made it especially for you.
It's my dick.
In a box.
I'll treasure it forever.
And there's no balls on it, either.
It's just the shaft.
I don't need 'em.
Okay.
I'm so proud of you.
Really?
When I say this, this is the truest thing
I've ever said:
You're the best director I've ever worked with, and I've done over 400 movies.
Hey, Laura.
Thank you so much.
I couldn't have done this without you.
I don't know about that, but how do you think it'll turn out?
A lot different than the script I wrote, thanks to you.
Thank you, thank you so much.
Thank you for taking me seriously.
You're welcome.
No, I mean it.
To be given this chance, this opportunity, really means a lot to me and it's really special.
Thank you.
See you at the premiere.
¶ Don't really care ¶
¶ Who found who ¶
Hi, honey.
It's Mommy and Daddy to wish you a happy birthday.
We wish we could be there to celebrate.
We love you so much.
You call us- Hurry up.
Bye, sweetheart.
Do you think she had any idea?
Please, she doesn't even know we exist.
Surprise!
Sandwich!
Whose idea was this?
Who do you think, Balaban?
Happy birthday.
Aww.
Cheers.
Hey.
Hi.
So let's dance, huh?
Guys, thank you so much.
Blow out your cock!
Oh, my God.
Come on.
Why don't you make a wish?
!
Let's go upstairs.
I got a little surprise for you up on the roof.
¶ Give you a chance ¶
Here, put this on.
Cheers.
Hey, you know what, this-
Thank you.
Hey, how-
Whoa.
What are you thinking?
That I really wanna kiss you right now.
Well, if she's not here, then we'll just go back to the room.
Hello.
Hi.
Are you guys the fluffers?
No, we're the Balabans, Jody's parents.
She's with her new boyfriend.
Jody has a boyfriend.
Boyfriend, what?
Yeah, Jeff.
Jeff Drake.
Director.
Directed by Jeff Drake.
Jupiter, Mars, Uranus.
It's like a sci-fi thing.
Honey, let's go, let's keep walking.
We'll find her desk.
Could you do a scene with-
He's not out of his dressing room yet.
I think I'm going crazy.
I just saw my parents.
How was your flight?
Our- it was lovely.
We saw a terrific movie.
It's the- oh, a Ron Howard movie.
What's the name, what was it called, honey?
It's called "this is your fault. "
It's not anybody's fault.
Why does this have to be somebody's fault, Dad?
You tell me.
After you've paid four years of Ivy League tuition and two years of grad school for your daughter, who ends up-
What?
Getting a good job, working as an editor?
Some things aren't worth the sacrifice.
I'm not sacrificing anything.
I saw you with that-
What's his name?
The pornographer.
Jeff.
Look, I can imagine how this must seem to you, but you should have more faith in your daughter.
Would you?
If she wound up working at a place like this?
Oh, hell no, no.
In fact, I'd use this on her.
Except she kind of likes it.
Okay, okay, let's go.
He's kidding, he's kidding, he's kidding.
It's not funny.
That's not how you talk to my parents.
I'm sorry.
See, I didn't know how to speak to your parents because I didn't come here with any sort of preconceptions as to who they were.
All I know is I'm crazy about their daughter.
She's a little quick to judge, but no one's perfect.
What's your point?
We shouldn't be so quick to judge you?
What, is he kidding me?
A man is what a man does.
Come on.
Why did you have to antagonize them?
Why didn't you say anything?
Is it because a small part of you agrees with them?
Or a big part?
This was a horrible idea and I told you it was.
Okay, okay, I was wrong.
Is that what you wanted me to say, I'm wrong?
Yes!
But did you have to be so hard on her-
Mom, Dad, wait.
Look, he's not what you think.
He's really talented.
He's honest and he believes in me.
How can you be so naive, Jody?
That man could give a damn about you.
You're just a sweet, little detour from his jaded, perverted life.
And that's where it ends.
How can you not see that?
Dad, you're wrong.
Come on, let's go.
Mom.
Debra, get in the car.
Look at how happy she is.
What's wrong with being happy?
¶ And someday ¶
¶ My, my, my ¶
¶ I'll be your life... ¶
I took your advice, Balaban.
The one with the faces.
No.
No, I'm a little drunk.
And I would... good for you to take advantage of me.
If you're here to apologize, you're doing a good job.
¶ Lady ¶
¶ I'll make you change ¶
Jeff!
Fuck you.
Hey, stop, stop.
I thought that was you in there.
You must really think I'm stupid.
But I'm not.
I may be a loser at the dating game, but I had an Ivy League education.
Yeah, so your father boasted.
Not like most of the people here.
I didn't drop out of Fuck Me High at 16 to come to Grind to edit pussy and suck the director's dick.
I came to get what I needed and get out.
Stop.
Before you say something you might regret.
Like what?
Like maybe my dad was right?
Or was it your dad?
Jeff vs. Jody.
I didn't know who to root for.
Yeah?
You pulled it off.
I can't thank you enough, Irene.
No thanks necessary, honey.
I mean, I just watched the final cut of Jeff's movie.
Excellent work.
I really think it's gonna empower the female audience.
God, I'm such a genius for hiring you.
What did he say about it?
Jeff, I'm not sure.
You know, he's made himself kind of scarce this week, so...
Oh, your last check.
Here you go.
I hope you understand that I cannot let you edit your movie here.
Just with what's transpired with Jeff, it would be really bad business.
I understand.
God, it's such a shame you two didn't just fuck each other's lights out and get it over with.
Like that's the answer to all of life's problems.
It's the answer to some of the problems.
Some pretty big ones, honey.
I need to get laid.
Who is it?
I said, who the fuck is it?
I'm sorry, it's Jody Balaban.
I was the editor.
I know who you are.
You can come in.
You've done a nice job with Jeff's movie.
Most people just go for the gore and you actually entice before the payoff.
Maybe that's 'cause...
I think sex is something that's better off when it's earned.
Or maybe you're just a natural-born cock tease.
Hey, that's one of the best parts of being a woman.
That and being a mother.
You're a mother?
And a wife.
Married eight years.
One beautiful son.
That's crazy.
Does your husband know what you do?
Of course he knows what I do.
He financed my first movie.
What could I say?
He gets off watching me have sex with other men.
As long as it's him I make love to.
Hey, if there's one thing you can learn from working here at Grind, Jody, it's to each his own.
Or her own.
You know what's funny?
I had so many conversations with you in my head, but you're nothing like I expected.
You know what else is funny?
How much you respect Laura.
I'm a better actress than you thought, huh?

I would love to set up a meeting at our agency.
Thank you.
Great job, Jody!
Thanks.
Ooh!
What's the matter?
Nobody came.
Everybody came.
From Grind.
Well, what'd you expect?
I mean, they're probably out having their ass hairs waxed or something.
I am so glad your father didn't hear that.
Mom!
Oh!
Hey, Kathleen.
Oh, my baby girl.
I'm so glad you made it here.
I would not have missed this for the world.
Did Dad come?
Jody?
Oh, there's-
Hi.
Hey, hey.
Sindi.
Where were you sitting?
I was just-
Next to me.
You did a great job.
Yeah.
You too.
I can never figure this out.
I need to-
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you, Dad.
Well, I'm gonna go get a drink.
My daughter, my daughter.
So what'd you think?
You are so talented and everyone was awesome.
I can't wait to tell them.
Why didn't they come?
They're in Vegas.
Y'know, it's the AVN Awards tomorrow night.
Oh, the Adult Video Awards.
Yeah.
Right.
Well, Jeff's up for Best Director.
So that's exciting, right?
You guys know that I didn't really mean to hurt any of you, right?
And that I appreciate you so much.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm so sorry.
I don't remember anything about that night.
I was really wasted.
It really wasn't Jeff's fault, 'cause- 'cause he- he thought that I was you.
So you and Jeff never-
I wish.
We've all been trying to get in his pants for years.
I'm beginning to wonder if he can still get it up.
What do you mean?
Jeff hasn't been with a woman since his wife left him.
It's funny how it works in our business.
You gotta keep it a secret when you don't screw around.
Oh, God, I almost forgot.
This is for you.
Thanks.
Listen, I've got to catch my plane to Vegas, so...
I'll see you around, okay?
Okay.
I didn't open your present.
Oh, that's not from me.
It's from Jeff.
See you at the Oscars.
Live from Las Vegas, welcome to this year's AVN Awards.
It's the biggest night for the adult industry's brightest stars.

There's Wicked's Dave O.
And welcome to this year's AVN Awards.
This next category reminds me of that Victor Mature quote,
"I'm no actor and I have 64 movies to prove it. "
You're so immature.
Ooh...
Anyway, this year's nominees for
Best Actor in a video are...
Got ID?
Yeah.
Company ID.
Wicked, Vivid-
Grind.
Well... not anymore.
Can't let you in without an ID, sweet tits.
Hey, Bobby.
Hi, ladies.
Can't do it.
Hi.
About time.
You better get in there.
You're gonna miss Jeff's big speech.
They won't let me in.
Really.
And finally, for the Best Director nominees.
We have Ryan Raven for "Back-End Deal,"

a film you can actually whack off to at an art-house theater near you.
And the winner is...
Jeff Drake!
Jeff!
Oh, wow, wow.
Thank you, thank you so much.
It's- it's always a thrill to be up here.
Let me start by thanking all the hardworking people at Grind.
I couldn't have done this without you.
Especially Irene Fox, who is my dear friend.
Well, I'd also like to thank the industry for the last time.
The adult world has been good to me, but it's time for me to move on.
Before I do, I'd like to say a special thanks to a very special woman.
I'd like to thank the star of my film, the one, the only...
Bliss.
Everyone, this is Jody.
She was my-
Editor.
And my- Cowriter.
And-
His self-righteous, cock-teasing... dildo-hiding-
You had me at cock-teasing.
¶ Ooh... ¶
¶ Found your secret ¶
¶ The secret of life ¶
¶ I want to share it with you ¶
¶ Trust ¶
¶ And you say ¶
¶ The secret that's deep inside ¶
¶ That magic door ¶
¶ Inside of you ¶
¶ Love ¶
¶ Love ¶
¶ And when you find it ¶
¶ You will know ¶
¶ Love ¶
¶ Love unconditional ¶
¶ Oh love ¶
¶ Love unconditional ¶
¶ Trust and you'll find ¶
¶ The secret that's deep inside ¶
¶ That magic door ¶
¶ Inside of you ¶
¶ Oh, oh, oh love ¶
¶ Love unconditional ¶
¶ And when you find it ¶
¶ You will know ¶
¶ Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa ¶
¶ Love ¶
¶ Love unconditional ¶
¶ Oh love ¶
¶ Love unconditional ¶
¶ Yes ¶
¶ It's a secret ¶
¶ But it's not really a secret ¶
¶ Because it's really inside of us ¶
¶ It's inside everybody ¶
¶ You've just got to find it ¶
¶ You've just got to find it ¶
¶ Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa ¶
¶ Love ¶
¶ Oh love ¶

I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
I am so fine with it, Ann, seriously.
It's so fine.
As long as you and I are cool.
You know my code.
Hos before bros.
- Uteruses before duderuses.
- Got it.
Ovaries before brovaries.
- You make such good coffee.
- Look,
I know you're saying you're okay but I've been in this position before.
And I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't actually.
- It was kind of weird.
- The thing is, Mark isn't my ex.
We slept together six years ago.
Anyway, I'm over it.
Or am I?
I'm just kidding.
This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
A community garden.
Right in the middle of the pit.
We're encouraging people to come out and plant whatever they want.
And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
It's so hot.
I had to get some more iced tea.
People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
And Tom is our master horticulturist.
He knows all the scientific names.
Right, Tom?
- Like this.
What's this?
- Those are, of course, tomatoes.
Or souljaboy tellems.
Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of our plants,
I just give her the names of rappers.
- And those over there?
- Those are some diddies.
There's some bonethugs and harmoniums right here.
- Growing beautifully.
- Those ludacrises are coming in great.
Look.
Someone planted something new.
What's this?
What do you think?
Carrots?
If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.
Some kind of spice?
You know, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, is roll it up into a joint and smoke it.
Ron, did you get my text?
Did you get my emails?
Did you see that I paged you?
I did not.
Did you check your voicemail?
I didn't.
We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
- Call the cops.
- That'll leak to the press.
Then there'll be an investigation.
And they'll find my fingerprints on the manure.
- And then we'll lose our funding.
- You don't have.
And we never will if this gets out.
Look, I will call the cops, but give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
And listen, if this thing blows up,
I was never here.
I have a hernia.
I've had it for a while.
And I've been ignoring it... successfully, but this morning,
I made the mistake of sneezing.
But as long as I sit still and don't move my head
or torso,
I'm good, I got this.
We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Who is this kingpin?
It's a 13-year-old kid named Stevie who likes to get high and make his transformers look like they're having sex.
I would like to be president some day, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.
I ate a brownie once.
At a party in college.
It was intense.
It was kind of indescribable, actually.
I felt like I was floating.
Turns out there wasn't any pot in it.
It was just an insanely good brownie.
You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal, 'cause we flip the headline.
And it's not "community garden infested with pot", it's "brave public servants
"rid neighborhood of drugs,
"earn praise from mayor, comma, everyone."
We gotta catch this guy.
Get the van, meet me at 7:00.
It's stakeout time.
Get my lunch for me, please.
Okay, like order you something?
No, get it... from there.
Is this some kind of weird power trip?
Please.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
You're welcome.
I have stakeout supplies.
This is stuff that we're probably gonna need.
We have notepads, pencils, and pencil case.
Shakable whipped cream.
Cameras.
Gorp.
And... candy necklaces.
It's like we're real police.
And I made us a mix CD.
It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
It's mostly Sting.
- I put our faces on there.
- It's really cool.
Are you gonna wear that shirt?
Yeah.
You like it?
Tommy Hilfiger?
No, Tom Haverford.
I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
Everyone thinks it's Hilfiger.
You should be wearing something like this.
Take this.
Wear black.
Black is what you wear in a stakeout.
I have to figure out how this works.
- Just let me focus up on this.
- Pretty bummed this fits.
Okay, now we just need to take a test shot
- and see how this goes.
- Take a test shot.
Ready?
- Focus up on the pit.
All right.
- Stop.
- Focus up right where the...
- Stop.
Focus up right where the weed...
Stop.
Stop.
Leslie swears it's okay.
So I'm going out with Mark.
I got to get back out there.
When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie.
And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Look, it's Mark.
What are you doing?
What?
I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Good.
Are you ready?
Oh, no, I need another hour to get ready.
Seriously?
'Cause I think the movie starts in like...
You're joking around right now.
This is gonna be fun.
You know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains too.
That was silly.
Are they dating now?
Brendanawicz is the man.
This is Brendanawicz's life:
hot chick from the newspaper, hot chick from the post office, hot chick from the hospital.
Her name's Ann.
You know her name.
Her name's Ann.
I'm just saying, nobody turns him down.
I did.
Yeah, I did.
We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said, "nuh-uh, no, sir, Mark Brendanawicz.
'I don't need your business here."
Get down!
Working late?
Shovel guitar
Shovel guitar
Somebody wants to play shovel guitar
Leslie's been playing shovel guitar for about an hour now.
Bucket drum
Bucket drum
- You're not from here, right?
- No, I'm from South Carolina.
But you moved to South Carolina from where?
- My mother's uterus.
- But you were conceived in Libya?
I was conceived in America.
My parents are Indian.
Where did the name Haverford come from?
My birth name is...
Darwish Zubair Ismail Gani.
Then I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny-sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics.
- What about Barack Obama?
- Yeah, fine, Barack Obama.
If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was gonna be elected president,
- Maybe I wouldn't have changed it.
- Did you hear that?
It's the kingpin.
Write this down.
White male, light brown hair.
Just take pictures.
Oh, my God.
It looks like Andy.
That is Andy.
That is Andy.
Andy is the kingpin.
Andy, come here.
Oh, hey, you guys.
What are you doing here?
It's so good to see you.
- Quietly.
- What happened?
- You're living in the pit now?
- For now, yeah.
It's awesome.
Somebody planted a garden down there with fruits and vegetables,
- so I'm getting a lot of vitamins.
- That's our community garden.
Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed next to the tomatoes.
Don't look at me.
There's weed down there?
I thought that was the tops of carrots.
Right, I know.
Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?
Why don't you come helping us?
To catch the guy.
You could tell us what you've seen.
I'm supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.
He's like 20 minutes late.
All right.
Let's do it.
Do you live here?
Yeah, do you live here?
Catch.
Yeah, I thought so.
I went home, but I had this strange feeling that there was something wrong with you, so I came back.
It's just a minor medical issue.
AIDS?
No, I'm safe.
Blindness?
Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee?
I have a hernia.
- Do you have syphilis?
- I said it's a hernia.
I know.
It's possible to have two things.
Do you need a ride to the hospital?
Yes, please.
But I rode my bike, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon.
Thank you.
- You still here?
- I wanted to see if you could tell.
Are you still here?
It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Man, oh, man.
So how's Ann?
She's doing good?
I miss her so much, it's ridiculous.
- How's she doing?
- Doing good tonight.
She's out on a...
Ann is great.
And I bet she really misses you.
I'm gonna need more if I'm gonna stay up.
- Is that candy?
- It's a necklace made out of candy.
- Want one?
- Oh, all right.
Great.
All I've had is fruits and vegetables... for weeks now.
Oh, my God.
You know there's a string in there.
Not in this one.
Instant sugar high.
Sugar high.
Sugar hit high.
Sugar high.
High.
Are you okay?
Sugar slam.
Maybe we should get you something more substantial to eat.
I'm in.
Bring me back two cheeseburgers and a green tea.
Come on.
You got to be kidding me.
So that was fun.
Yeah, it really was.
- Surprisingly fun.
- You know what,
I have been a perfect gentleman this evening.
In fact, watch this.
I would like you to now please invite me in for a nightcap.
- Not a chance.
- No.
Just watch... watch what I'm gonna do.
Ask me in for a nightcap.
- Will you come in for a nightcap?
- Yes, I will.
No, no, damn.
Drats, I was gonna plan to not.
Wait.
Look.
That guy's trying to break into that van.
It does look like he's breaking into that van.
- 911.
- Hi, there.
So, do you like spy on Ann?
From the pit?
I just like being nearby.
That way if she wants me back,
I could be at her house in two seconds, before she changes her mind.
I don't really know how healthy that is.
You aren't even dating anymore.
She might be dating somebody else.
- Is she?
- What?
- Is she dating somebody else?
- What?
- She's dating somebody else?
- I didn't say that.
- Who is she dating?
- Nobody.
Mark.
It's cool.
My God!
641 to base style.
I'm at the vehicle now.
How are you doing tonight?
I'm all right, officer.
How are you?
I'm responding to a 911 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
I need you to step out and show me some ID.
It's okay, my name's Tom Haverford.
I work for the Parks Department.
I got locked out of the van.
I had to jimmy my way back in.
Why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some ID?
I just told you my ID, so what's the crime here?
Parking while Indian?
There's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles.
All right, fine.
Here's my ID.
Nice job, Paul Blart.
Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into lady-foot locker?
I'm very close to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
- Step out of the van.
- I'll step out of your mama's van.
I didn't do anything!
I'm a city employee.
- Come on!
- Calm down.
Motion sensors.
My God.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Cops took him.
What?
- My God.
- Ann and Mark!
It's Ann and Mark.
We caught a criminal.
Do you know about this?
He was breaking into this van, and they dragged him away.
It was crazy.
Right here.
What are you doing here?
If you could just stop writing for a second and focus here, 'cause...
Ma'am.
As I've already told you, this is a police matter.
It doesn't seem to matter to the police.
- Nice job with that, but listen...
- Let me ask you a question.
Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van?
That's not what happened.
Could you please go home, get some sleep and let this matter be resolved?
Let's just go home.
Let's go home.
- No!
- Let's just go home.
Easy.
- Come with me.
- I'd like to come with you.
Your friend, he acted like an ass.
And he didn't give me a choice.
Your name's Dave?
Can I call you Dave?
My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on...
I hate to break it to you.
You really stepped in it.
What?
I'm a government employee, and so is your prisoner.
If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here.
Kicking down your doors.
That's right, you heard me.
What branch of government are you in?
Parks and Recreation.
Do I stutter?
It wasn't just his behavior.
I think your friend might be a pervert.
That's what people think when they first meet him
- but he's all talk.
- I'm being serious.
We searched the van, and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date.
We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy.
Tom and I were in that van together.
We were staking out the community garden because somebody planted marijuana in it.
I brought the candy, a lot of it because I love it.
I took the pictures.
My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
It's been a very long night.
But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail.
Well, they're gonna release him.
In a little while.
Thank God.
Should I get you home right now?
You two go ahead.
I'm gonna stay here and wait for Tom.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Prison changes a man.
I think he'll wanna see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Well, OK, then.
See you, Leslie.
Yo.
I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
You ready?
I was born ready.
I'm Ron [beep] Swanson.
Easy.
Care...
Careful!
Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in.
Terrible things happened last time.
So I guess I'll just... see you tomorrow.
Bye.
You kind of kissed me.
Yes, I did, and now we both have herpes.
I'll see you later.
- Thanks for waiting.
Appreciate it.
- Mother Teresa.
It's not your chocolate.
Don't... get your hands off that.
- Wake up.
- What?
Is this your house?
Where are we?
You're awake?
- Thanks for the coat.
- It's no problem, you can keep it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I need that for my uniform.
But I can give you a ride.
We'll talk about the coat.
- I can't give it to you.
Understand?
- OK.
So where's that marijuana at?
It's down in the garden.
Good meeting you, man.
Should grab a drink some time.
I hope Ann and Mark got home okay.
That's all that matters.
That Ann is home, and she's okay.
And that Mark is also okay, and he is in his home.
Just important that they're both in their homes.
Mark's an idiot.
You could do a lot better than him.
Forget about him.
Thanks, Tom.
I didn't mean me.
Keep it in your pants, Knope.
I swear to God, it actually... it was there.
These are... carrots.
You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Is that the house there where your best friend lives?
Where she saw the van from?
I get it.
What?
You wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date.
I did not.
- There actually was weed here.
- It's okay.
I think it's kind of cute.
I like Miss Knope.
I gotta say when I first met her, I didn't care much for her, because, like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable.
Miss Knope was attractive to me as a man.
I was attracted to her in her demeanor.
I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
What a crazy night.
Partner?
Want to go get some breakfast?
What?
No.
Take me home.
What is wrong with you?
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on!
I wonder if mini golf is open.
Home!
Ann-danawicz, what are you guys doing?
Eating?
Love it.
Just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night.
That was cool.
Peace.
We didn't think you were a pervert.
We thought you were a criminal.
For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert.
I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
I am so fine with it, Ann, seriously.
It's so fine.
As long as you and I are cool.
You know my code.
Hos before bros.
- Uteruses before duderuses.
- Got it.
Ovaries before brovaries.
- You make such good coffee.
- Look,
I know you're saying you're okay but I've been in this position before.
And I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't actually.
- It was kind of weird.
- The thing is, Mark isn't my ex.
We slept together six years ago.
Anyway, I'm over it.
Or am I?
I'm just kidding.
This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
A community garden.

We're encouraging people to come out and plant whatever they want.
And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
It's so hot.
I had to get some more iced tea.
People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
And Tom is our master horticulturist.
He knows all the scientific names.
Right, Tom?
- Like this.
What's this?
- Those are, of course, tomatoes.
Or souljaboy tellems.
Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of our plants,
I just give her the names of rappers.
- And those over there?
- Those are some diddies.
There's some bonethugs and harmoniums right here.
- Growing beautifully.
- Those ludacrises are coming in great.
Look.
Someone planted something new.
What's this?
What do you think?
Carrots?
If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.
Some kind of spice?
You know, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, is roll it up into a joint and smoke it.
Ron, did you get my text?
Did you get my emails?
Did you see that I paged you?
I did not.
Did you check your voicemail?
I didn't.
We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
- Call the cops.
- That'll leak to the press.
Then there'll be an investigation.
And they'll find my fingerprints on the manure.
- And then we'll lose our funding.
- You don't have.
And we never will if this gets out.

- Sure.
- Thank you.
And listen, if this thing blows up,
I was never here.
I have a hernia.
I've had it for a while.
And I've been ignoring it... successfully, but this morning,
I made the mistake of sneezing.
But as long as I sit still and don't move my head
or torso,
I'm good, I got this.
We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Who is this kingpin?
It's a 13-year-old kid named Stevie who likes to get high and make his transformers look like they're having sex.
I would like to be president some day, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.
I ate a brownie once.
At a party in college.
It was intense.
It was kind of indescribable, actually.
I felt like I was floating.
Turns out there wasn't any pot in it.
It was just an insanely good brownie.
You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal, 'cause we flip the headline.
And it's not "community garden infested with pot", it's "brave public servants
"rid neighborhood of drugs,
"earn praise from mayor, comma, everyone."
We gotta catch this guy.
Get the van, meet me at 7:00.
It's stakeout time.
Get my lunch for me, please.
Okay, like order you something?
No, get it... from there.
Is this some kind of weird power trip?
Please.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
You're welcome.
I have stakeout supplies.
This is stuff that we're probably gonna need.
We have notepads, pencils, and pencil case.
Shakable whipped cream.
Cameras.
Gorp.
And... candy necklaces.
It's like we're real police.
And I made us a mix CD.
It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
It's mostly Sting.
- I put our faces on there.
- It's really cool.
Are you gonna wear that shirt?
Yeah.
You like it?
Tommy Hilfiger?
No, Tom Haverford.
I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
Everyone thinks it's Hilfiger.
You should be wearing something like this.
Take this.
Wear black.
Black is what you wear in a stakeout.
I have to figure out how this works.
- Just let me focus up on this.
- Pretty bummed this fits.
Okay, now we just need to take a test shot
- and see how this goes.
- Take a test shot.
Ready?
- Focus up on the pit.
All right.
- Stop.
- Focus up right where the...
- Stop.
Focus up right where the weed...
Stop.
Stop.
Leslie swears it's okay.
So I'm going out with Mark.
I got to get back out there.
When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie.
And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Look, it's Mark.
What are you doing?
What?
I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Good.
Are you ready?
Oh, no, I need another hour to get ready.
Seriously?
'Cause I think the movie starts in like...
You're joking around right now.
This is gonna be fun.
You know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains too.
That was silly.
Are they dating now?
Brendanawicz is the man.
This is Brendanawicz's life:
hot chick from the newspaper, hot chick from the post office, hot chick from the hospital.
Her name's Ann.
You know her name.
Her name's Ann.
I'm just saying, nobody turns him down.
I did.
Yeah, I did.
We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said, "nuh-uh, no, sir, Mark Brendanawicz.
'I don't need your business here."
Get down!
Working late?
Shovel guitar
Shovel guitar
Somebody wants to play shovel guitar
Leslie's been playing shovel guitar for about an hour now.
Bucket drum
Bucket drum
- You're not from here, right?
- No, I'm from South Carolina.
But you moved to South Carolina from where?
- My mother's uterus.
- But you were conceived in Libya?
I was conceived in America.
My parents are Indian.
Where did the name Haverford come from?
My birth name is...
Darwish Zubair Ismail Gani.
Then I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny-sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics.
- What about Barack Obama?
- Yeah, fine, Barack Obama.
If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was gonna be elected president,
- Maybe I wouldn't have changed it.
- Did you hear that?
It's the kingpin.
Write this down.
White male, light brown hair.
Just take pictures.
Oh, my God.
It looks like Andy.
That is Andy.
That is Andy.
Andy is the kingpin.
Andy, come here.
Oh, hey, you guys.
What are you doing here?
It's so good to see you.
- Quietly.
- What happened?
- You're living in the pit now?
- For now, yeah.
It's awesome.
Somebody planted a garden down there with fruits and vegetables,
- so I'm getting a lot of vitamins.
- That's our community garden.
Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed next to the tomatoes.
Don't look at me.
There's weed down there?
I thought that was the tops of carrots.
Right, I know.
Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?
Why don't you come helping us?
To catch the guy.
You could tell us what you've seen.
I'm supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.
He's like 20 minutes late.
All right.
Let's do it.
Do you live here?
Yeah, do you live here?
Catch.
Yeah, I thought so.
I went home, but I had this strange feeling that there was something wrong with you, so I came back.
It's just a minor medical issue.
AIDS?
No, I'm safe.
Blindness?
Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee?
I have a hernia.
- Do you have syphilis?
- I said it's a hernia.
I know.
It's possible to have two things.
Do you need a ride to the hospital?
Yes, please.
But I rode my bike, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon.
Thank you.
- You still here?
- I wanted to see if you could tell.
Are you still here?
It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Man, oh, man.
So how's Ann?
She's doing good?
I miss her so much, it's ridiculous.
- How's she doing?
- Doing good tonight.
She's out on a...
Ann is great.
And I bet she really misses you.
I'm gonna need more if I'm gonna stay up.
- Is that candy?
- It's a necklace made out of candy.
- Want one?
- Oh, all right.
Great.
All I've had is fruits and vegetables... for weeks now.
Oh, my God.
You know there's a string in there.
Not in this one.
Instant sugar high.
Sugar high.
Sugar hit high.
Sugar high.
High.
Are you okay?
Sugar slam.
Maybe we should get you something more substantial to eat.
I'm in.
Bring me back two cheeseburgers and a green tea.
Come on.
You got to be kidding me.
So that was fun.
Yeah, it really was.
- Surprisingly fun.
- You know what,
I have been a perfect gentleman this evening.
In fact, watch this.
I would like you to now please invite me in for a nightcap.
- Not a chance.
- No.
Just watch... watch what I'm gonna do.
Ask me in for a nightcap.
- Will you come in for a nightcap?
- Yes, I will.
No, no, damn.
Drats, I was gonna plan to not.
Wait.
Look.
That guy's trying to break into that van.
It does look like he's breaking into that van.
- 911.
- Hi, there.
So, do you like spy on Ann?
From the pit?
I just like being nearby.
That way if she wants me back,
I could be at her house in two seconds, before she changes her mind.
I don't really know how healthy that is.
You aren't even dating anymore.
She might be dating somebody else.
- Is she?
- What?
- Is she dating somebody else?
- What?
- She's dating somebody else?
- I didn't say that.
- Who is she dating?
- Nobody.
Mark.
It's cool.
My God!
641 to base style.
I'm at the vehicle now.
How are you doing tonight?
I'm all right, officer.
How are you?
I'm responding to a 911 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
I need you to step out and show me some ID.
It's okay, my name's Tom Haverford.
I work for the Parks Department.
I got locked out of the van.
I had to jimmy my way back in.
Why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some ID?
I just told you my ID, so what's the crime here?
Parking while Indian?
There's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles.
All right, fine.
Here's my ID.
Nice job, Paul Blart.
Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into lady-foot locker?
I'm very close to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
- Step out of the van.
- I'll step out of your mama's van.
I didn't do anything!
I'm a city employee.
- Come on!
- Calm down.
Motion sensors.
My God.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Cops took him.
What?
- My God.
- Ann and Mark!
It's Ann and Mark.
We caught a criminal.
Do you know about this?
He was breaking into this van, and they dragged him away.
It was crazy.
Right here.
What are you doing here?
If you could just stop writing for a second and focus here, 'cause...
Ma'am.
As I've already told you, this is a police matter.
It doesn't seem to matter to the police.
- Nice job with that, but listen...
- Let me ask you a question.
Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van?
That's not what happened.
Could you please go home, get some sleep and let this matter be resolved?
Let's just go home.
Let's go home.
- No!
- Let's just go home.
Easy.
- Come with me.
- I'd like to come with you.
Your friend, he acted like an ass.
And he didn't give me a choice.
Your name's Dave?
Can I call you Dave?
My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on...
I hate to break it to you.
You really stepped in it.
What?
I'm a government employee, and so is your prisoner.
If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here.
Kicking down your doors.
That's right, you heard me.
What branch of government are you in?
Parks and Recreation.
Do I stutter?
It wasn't just his behavior.
I think your friend might be a pervert.
That's what people think when they first meet him
- but he's all talk.
- I'm being serious.
We searched the van, and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date.
We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy.
Tom and I were in that van together.
We were staking out the community garden because somebody planted marijuana in it.
I brought the candy, a lot of it because I love it.
I took the pictures.
My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
It's been a very long night.
But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail.
Well, they're gonna release him.
In a little while.
Thank God.
Should I get you home right now?
You two go ahead.
I'm gonna stay here and wait for Tom.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Prison changes a man.
I think he'll wanna see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Well, OK, then.
See you, Leslie.
Yo.
I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
You ready?
I was born ready.
I'm Ron [beep] Swanson.
Easy.
Care...
Careful!
Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in.
Terrible things happened last time.
So I guess I'll just... see you tomorrow.
Bye.
You kind of kissed me.
Yes, I did, and now we both have herpes.
I'll see you later.
- Thanks for waiting.
Appreciate it.
- Mother Teresa.
It's not your chocolate.
Don't... get your hands off that.
- Wake up.
- What?
Is this your house?
Where are we?
You're awake?
- Thanks for the coat.
- It's no problem, you can keep it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I need that for my uniform.
But I can give you a ride.
We'll talk about the coat.
- I can't give it to you.
Understand?
- OK.
So where's that marijuana at?
It's down in the garden.
Good meeting you, man.
Should grab a drink some time.
I hope Ann and Mark got home okay.
That's all that matters.
That Ann is home, and she's okay.
And that Mark is also okay, and he is in his home.
Just important that they're both in their homes.
Mark's an idiot.
You could do a lot better than him.
Forget about him.
Thanks, Tom.
I didn't mean me.
Keep it in your pants, Knope.
I swear to God, it actually... it was there.
These are... carrots.
You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Is that the house there where your best friend lives?
Where she saw the van from?
I get it.
What?
You wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date.
I did not.
- There actually was weed here.
- It's okay.
I think it's kind of cute.
I like Miss Knope.
I gotta say when I first met her, I didn't care much for her, because, like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable.
Miss Knope was attractive to me as a man.
I was attracted to her in her demeanor.
I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
What a crazy night.
Partner?
Want to go get some breakfast?
What?
No.
Take me home.
What is wrong with you?
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on!
I wonder if mini golf is open.
Home!
Ann-danawicz, what are you guys doing?
Eating?
Love it.
Just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night.
That was cool.
Peace.
We didn't think you were a pervert.
We thought you were a criminal.
For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert.
I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
Oh, my God.
I'm so fine with it, Ann.
Seriously.
It's so fine.
As long as you and I are cool.
You know my code.
Hoes before bros.
Uteruses before duderuses.
Got it.
Ovaries before brovaries.
You make such good coffee.
Look, I know you're saying you're okay with it, but I've been in this position before, and I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't, actually.
It was kind of weird.
But the thing is, Mark isn't my ex.
You know, we slept together six years ago.
Anyway, I'm over it.
Or am I?
I'm just kidding.
This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
A community garden, right in the middle of the pit.
We're encouraging people to just come out and plant whatever they want.
And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
It's so hot.
I had to get some more iced tea.
People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
And Tom is our master horticulturist.
He knows all the scientific names for everything.
Right, Tom?
Yeah.
Like this.
What's this, Tom?
Those are, of course, tomatoes, or Soulja Boy Tell 'Ems.
Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of any of our plants,
I just give her the names of rappers.
And those over there?
Those are some Diddys.
Those are some Bone Thugs-n-Harmony-ums right here.
Growing beautifully.
Those Ludacrises are coming in great.
Look, someone planted something new.
What's this?
What do you think, carrots?
If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.
Maybe some kind of spice?
Yeah.
You know, Leslie, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, just roll it up into a joint and smoke it.
Ron, did you get my texts?
No.
Did you get my e-mails?
Mmm-mmm.
Did you see that I paged you?
I did not.
Did you check your voicemail?
I didn't.
We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
Okay.
Call the cops.
That'll leak to the press.
Then there'll be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding.
You don't have funding.
And we never will if this gets out.
Look, I will call the cops, but just give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?
Sure.
Thank you.
And listen, if this thing blows up,
I was never here.
I have a hernia.
I've had it for a while.
And I've been ignoring it, successfully.
But this morning,
I made the mistake of sneezing.
But as long as I sit still and don't move my head, or torso,
I'm good, I got this.
We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Who is this person?
Who is this kingpin?
It's a 13-year-old kid named Stevie, who likes to get high, and make his Transformers look like they're having sex together.
I would like to be President someday, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.
I ate a brownie once.
At a party in college.
It was intense.
It was kind of indescribable, actually.
I felt like I was floating.
Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie.
It was just an insanely good brownie.
You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal.
'Cause we flip the headline, and it's not
"Community Garden Infested With Pot."
It's "Brave Public Servants Rid Neighborhood of Drugs,
"Earn Praise from Mayor, comma, Everyone."
We got to catch this guy.
Get the van, meet me at 7:00.
It's stakeout time.
April?
Yeah?
Get my lunch for me, please.
Okay.
Like, order you something?
No, get it.
From there.
Is this some kind of weird power trip?
Please.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
You're welcome.
I have stakeout supplies.
This is stuff that we're probably going to need.
We have notepads, pencils and pencil case.
Shakable whipped cream.
Cameras.
Pork.
And candy necklaces.
It's like we're real police.
And I made us a mix CD.
It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
It's mostly Sting.
And look, I put our faces on there.
It's really cool.
Are you going to wear that shirt?
Yeah.
You like it?
Tommy Hilfiger?
No.
Tom Haverford.
I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
Here you go.
Everyone thinks it's Tommy Hilfiger.
Well, here.
You should be wearing something like this.
Take this.
Wear black.
Black is what you wear on a stakeout.
Okay, I have to figure out how this works.
Just let me focus up on this.
Pretty bummed this fits.
Okay, now I need to just take a test shot and see how this goes.
Test shot.
You ready?
Just focus up on the pit.
All right.
Stop.
Focus up right where the...
Stop.
Focus up right where the weed is...
Stop.
Stop.
Leslie swears it's okay.
So I'm going out with Mark.
I got to get back out there.
When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie.
And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Oh, look.
It's Mark.
What are you doing?
What?
I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Good.
Yeah.
Hey, Ann.
Hey.
So, you ready to go?
Oh, no.
I need another hour to get ready.
Seriously?
'Cause I think the movie starts in like...
Oh, you're joking around right now.
Wow.
This is going to be fun.
Yeah, well, you know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains, too.
Ew!
Silly.
Whoa!
Are they dating now?
Brendanawicz is the man.
This is Brendanawicz's life.
Hot chick from the newspaper, hot chick from the post office, hot chick from the hospital.
Her name's Ann.
You know her name.
Her name's Ann.
I'm just saying.
Nobody turns him down.
I did.
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said,
"No, sir, Mark Brendanawicz.
I don't need your business here."
Get down.
Working late?
Yeah.
Shovel guitar, shovel guitar
Somebody wants to play shovel guitar
Leslie's been playing shovel guitar for about an hour now.
Longer.
Bucket drum, bucket drum
You're not from here, right?
No.
I'm from South Carolina.
But you moved to South Carolina from where?
My mother's uterus.
But you were conceived in Libya, right?
Wow.
No.
I was conceived in America.
My parents are Indian.
Where did the name 'Haverford' come from?
My birth name is Darwish Sabir Ismael Gani, and I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny-sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics.
What about Barack Obama?
Okay, yeah, fine, Barack Obama.
If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was going to be elected President, yeah, maybe I wouldn't have changed it.
Oh, did you hear that noise?
Oh, my God.
It's the kingpin!
Write this down.
Okay, white male, light brown hair.
Just take pictures.
Oh, my God, it looks like Andy.
That is Andy.
That is Andy.
Andy is the kingpin.
Andy.
Come here.
Oh, hey, you guys.
What are you doing here?
It's so good to see you.
Quietly.
What happened?
You're living in the pit now?
For now, yeah.
It's awesome.
Somebody just planted a garden down there.
Fruits and vegetables, so I'm getting a lot of vitamins...

Thank you.
Bye.
Are you still here?
Yeah.
I just wanted to see if you could tell.
Are you still here?
It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Man, oh, man.
So how's Ann?
She's doing good?
Oh, I miss her so much, it's ridiculous.
How's she doing?
Doing good tonight.
She's out on a...
Ann is great.
And I bet she really misses you.
I'm going to need more of these if I'm going to stay up tonight.
Is that candy?
Yeah, it's a necklace, made out of candy.
You want one?
Oh, all right.
Great.
All I've had is fruits and vegetables, for weeks now.
Hmm.
Oh, my God!
You know, there's a string in there.

Will you come in for a nightcap?
Yes, I will.
No, no!
Damn!
Drat!
I was going to plan to not...
Wait, wait, wait.
To say no.
Look, that guy's trying to break into that van.
You know what, it does look like he's breaking into that van.
I just... 9- 1-1.
Hi, there.
So, Andy, do you, like, spy on Ann from the pit?
No.
No.
I just like being nearby.
That way, if she wants me back,
I can be at her house, like, in two seconds, before she changes her mind.

She might be dating somebody else.
Is she?

Huh?

You just said Ann might be dating somebody else.
Is she?
I didn't say that.
Who is she dating?
Nobody.
Mark.
That's cool.
Oh, my God!
641 to base, I'm at the vehicle now.
How you doing tonight, sir?
I'm all right, Officer.
How are you?
I'm responding to a 9-1-1 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.

Here's my ID.
Nice job, Paul Blart.
Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into Lady Foot Locker?
Hey.
I'm very close right now to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
Step out of the van.
I'll step out of your mama's van.
I didn't do anything!
I'm a city employee, man!
Come on!
Leslie!
Motion sensors.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me!
What are you doing?
What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Cops took him.
What?
Oh, my God!
Ann and Mark!
Andy!
It's Ann and Mark!
Andy?
Leslie?
Oh!
Leslie Knope.
Hey!
Hey!
Wow.
We caught a criminal.
Do you know about this?
Yeah, he was breaking into this van and they dragged him away.
It was crazy.
Right here.
What are you doing here?
If you could just stop writing for a second, and just focus here, because...
Ma'am, ma'am, as I've told you several times already, this is a police matter.
Well, it doesn't seem to matter to the police!
Okay.
Nice job with that.
But let's...
Let me ask you a question.
Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van?
No.
And thankfully, that's not what happened.
Now, could you please go home, and get some sleep, and let this matter be resolved.
Thank you, Officer.
Let's just go home, Leslie.
Yeah, let's go home.
Let's just go home.
No!
No!
Let's just go home.
No!
Easy!
No.
No, no, no, no, no!
Leslie...
Okay, come with me, please.
Fine.
I'd like to come with you.
Your friend, he acted like an ass.
And you got to believe me, he didn't give me a choice.
Your name's Dave, right?
Can I call you Dave?
My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on it 50-50.
Hate to break it to you, Dave.
You really stepped in it.
What?
I'm a government employee, David, and so is your prisoner.
If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here, kicking down your doors.
Yeah, that's right.
You heard me.
Ron Swanson.
What branch of government are you in?
Parks and Recreation.
Parks and Recreation?
Yes.
Do I stutter?
Look, Ms. Knope, it wasn't just his behavior, okay?
I think your friend might be some kind of a pervert.
No.
Look, that's what people think when they first meet him, but he's all talk.
It's just...
No, I'm being serious.
We searched the van and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date.
We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy.
Okay, look.
Tom and I were in that van together.
We were staking out the community garden, because somebody planted marijuana in it.
I brought the candy and I brought a lot of it, because I love candy.
I took the pictures.
My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
It's been a very long night.
But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail.
Well, they're going to release him in a little while.
Thank God.
Should I get you guys home right now?
You know, you two go ahead.
I'm going to stay here and wait for Tom.
Are you sure?
Yeah, prison changes a man.
I think he'll probably want to see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Well, okay, then.
See you, Leslie.
Yo.
I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
You ready?
I was born ready.
I'm Ron Swanson.
Easy.
Care...
Careful.
Take...
Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in.
Terrible things happened last time.
So, I guess I'll just see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Hey.
You kind of kissed me.
Yes, I did!
And now we both have herpes.
I'll see you later.
Leslie.
Thanks for waiting.
I appreciate it.
Mother Teresa, it's not your chocolate.
Don't...
Get your hands off that.
Wake up.
What?
Is this your house?
Where are we?
Hey.
You're awake.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for the coat.
It's no problem.
You can keep it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I need that for my uniform.
But I can give you a ride back to your car.
Okay.
And we'll talk about the coat.
I can't give it to you.
Do you understand?
Okay.
So, where's that marijuana at?
It's down in the garden.
Good meeting you, man!
We should grab a drink or something sometime.
I just hope that Ann and Mark got home okay.
That's all that matters, you know?
That Ann is home and she's okay.
And that Mark is also okay and he is in his home.
Just important that they're both in their homes...
Leslie.
Mark's an idiot.
You can do a lot better than him.
Forget about him.
Thanks, Tom.
I didn't mean me.
Keep it in your pants, Knope.
I swear to God, it actually...
It was there...
These are carrots.
Duh!
You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Is that the house there, where your best friend lives?
Where she saw the van from?
Yeah.
Okay.
I get it.
What?
Well, you wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date.
No, I did not.
There actually was weed here...
It's okay.
I think it's kind of cute.
I like Miss Knope.
I liked her.
I got to say, I...
When I first met her I didn't care much for her, because like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable.
Miss Knope was attractive to me.
As a man, I was attracted to her in her demeanor.
I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
Can we not...
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
What a crazy night.
Huh, partner?
Want to go get some breakfast?
What?
No!
Take me home.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on.
I wonder if mini golf is open.
Home!
Especially if you're going to...
I know.
Anndanawicz!
What're you guys doing?
Eating?
Love it.
Oh, hey, just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night.
That was cool.
Peace!
We didn't think you were a pervert, we thought you were a criminal.
For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert.
I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
I am so fine with it, Ann, seriously.
It's so fine.
As long as you and I are cool.
You know my code.
Hos before bros.
- Uteruses before duderuses.
- Got it.
Ovaries before brovaries.
- You make such good coffee.
- Look,
I know you're saying you're okay but I've been in this position before.
And I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't actually.
- It was kind of weird.
- The thing is, Mark isn't my ex.
We slept together six years ago.
Anyway, I'm over it.
Or am I?
I'm just kidding.
This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
A community garden.
Right in the middle of the pit.
We're encouraging people to come out and plant whatever they want.
And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
It's so hot.
I had to get some more iced tea.
People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
And Tom is our master horticulturist.
He knows all the scientific names.
Right, Tom?
- Like this.
What's this?
- Those are, of course, tomatoes.
Or souljaboy tellems.
Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of our plants,
I just give her the names of rappers.
- And those over there?
- Those are some diddies.
There's some bonethugs and harmoniums right here.
- Growing beautifully.
- Those ludacrises are coming in great.
Look.
Someone planted something new.
What's this?
What do you think?
Carrots?
If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.
Some kind of spice?
You know, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, is roll it up into a joint and smoke it.

Episode 202 The Stakeout
- Ron, did you get my text?
Did you get my emails?
Did you see that I paged you?
I did not.
Did you check your voicemail?
I didn't.
We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
- Call the cops.
- That'll leak to the press.
Then there'll be an investigation.
And they'll find my fingerprints.
- And then we'll lose our funding.
- You don't have.
And we never will if this gets out.
Look, I will call the cops, but give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
And listen, if this thing blows up,
I was never here.
I have a hernia.
I've had it for a while.
And I've been ignoring it... successfully, but this morning,
I made the mistake of sneezing.
But as long as I sit still and don't move my head
or torso,
I'm good, I got this.
We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Who is this kingpin?
It's a 13-year-old kid named Stevie who likes to get high and make his transformers look like they're having sex.
I would like to be president some day, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.
I ate a brownie once.
At a party in college.
It was intense.
It was kind of indescribable, actually.
I felt like I was floating.
Turns out there wasn't any pot in it.
It was just an insanely good brownie.
You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal.
'cause we flip the headline.
And it's not "community garden infested with pot", it's "brave public servants
"rid neighborhood of drugs,
"earn praise from mayor, comma, everyone."
We gotta catch this guy.
Get the van, meet me at 7:00.
It's stakeout time.
Get my lunch for me, please.
Okay, like order you something?
No, get it... from there.
Is this some kind of weird power trip?
Please.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
You're welcome.
I have stakeout supplies.
This is stuff that we're probably gonna need.
We have notepads, pencils, and pencil case.
Shakable whipped cream.
Cameras.
Gorp.
And... candy necklaces.
It's like we're real police.
And I made us a mix cd.
It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
It's mostly Sting.
- I put our faces on there.
- It's really cool.
- Are you gonna wear that shirt?
Yeah.
You like it?
Tommy Hilfiger?
No, Tom Haverford.
I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
Everyone thinks it's Hilfiger.
You should be wearing something like this.
Take this.
Wear black.
Black is what you wear in a stakeout.
I have to figure out how this works.
- Just let me focus up on this.
- Pretty bummed this fits.
Okay, now we just need to take a test shot
- and see how this goes.
- Take a test shot.
Ready?
- Focus up on the pit.
All right.
- Stop.
- Focus up right where the...
- Stop.
Focus up right where the weed...
Stop.
Stop.
Leslie swears it's okay.
So I'm going out with Mark.
I got to get back out there.
When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie.
And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Look, it's Mark.
What are you doing?
What?
I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Good.
Are you ready?
Oh, no, I need another hour to get ready.
Seriously?
'Cause I think the movie starts in like...
You're joking around right now.
This is gonna be fun.
You know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains too.
That was silly.
Are they dating now?
Brendanawicz is the man.
This is Brendanawicz's life:
hot chick from the newspaper, hot chick from the post office, hot chick from the hospital.
Her name's Ann.
You know her name.
Her name's Ann.
I'm just saying, nobody turns him down.
I did.
Yeah, I did.
We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said, "nuh-uh, no, sir, Mark Brendanawicz.
'I don't need your business here."
Get down!
Working late?
Shovel guitar
Shovel guitar
Somebody wants to play shovel guitar
Leslie's been playing shovel guitar for about an hour now.
Bucket drum
Bucket drum
- You're not from here, right?
- No, I'm from South Carolina.
But you moved to South Carolina from where?
- My mother's uterus.
- But you were conceived in Libya?
I was conceived in America.
My parents are Indian.
Where did the name Haverford come from?
My birth name is...
Darwish Zubair Ismail Gani.
Then I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny-sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics.
- What about Barack Obama?
- Yeah, fine, Barack Obama.
If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was gonna be elected president,
- Maybe I wouldn't have changed it.
- Did you hear?
It's the kingpin.
Write this down.
White male, light brown hair.
Just take pictures.
Oh, my God.
It looks like Andy.
That is Andy.
That is Andy.
Andy is the kingpin.
Andy, come here.
Oh, hey, you guys.
What are you doing here?
It's so good to see you.
- Quietly.
- What happened?
- You're living in the pit now?
- For now, yeah.
It's awesome.
Somebody planted a garden down there with fruits and vegetables,
- so I'm getting a lot of vitamins.
- That's our community garden.
Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed next to the tomatoes.
Don't look at me.
There's weed down there?
I thought that was of carrots.
Right, I know.
Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?
Why don't you come helping us?
To catch the guy.
You could tell us what you've seen.
I'm supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.
He's like 20 minutes late.
All right.
Let's do it.
Do you live here?
Yeah, do you live here?
Catch.
Yeah, I thought so.
I went home, but I had this strange feeling that there was something wrong, so I came back.
It's just a minor medical issue.
Aids?
No, I'm safe.
Blindness?
Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee?
I have a hernia.
- Do you have syphilis?
- I said it's a hernia.
I know.
It's possible to have two things.
Do you need a ride to the hospital?
Yes, please.
But I rode my bike, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon.
Thank you.
- You still here?
- I wanted to see if you could tell.
Are you still here?
It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Man, oh, man.
So how's Ann?
She's doing good?
I miss her so much, it's ridiculous.
- How's she doing?
- Doing good tonight.
She's out on a...
Ann is great.
And I bet she really misses you.
I'm gonna need more if I'm gonna stay up.
- Is that candy?
- It's a necklace made out of candy.
- Want one?
- Oh, all right.
Great.
All I've had is fruits and vegetables... for weeks now.
Oh, my God.
You know there's a string in there.
Not in this one.
Instant sugar high.
Sugar high.
Sugar hit high.
Sugar high.
High.
Are you okay?
Sugar slam.
Maybe we should get you something more substantial.
I'm in.
Bring me back two cheeseburgers and a green tea.
Come on.
You got to be kidding me.
So that was fun.
Yeah, it really was.
- Surprisingly fun.
- You know what,
I have been a perfect gentleman this evening.
In fact, watch this.
I would like you to now please invite me in for a nightcap.
- Not a chance.
- No.
Just watch... watch what I'm gonna do.
Ask me in for a nightcap.
- Will you come in for a nightcap?
- Yes, I will.
No, no, damn.
Drats, I was gonna plan to not.
Wait.
Look.
That guy's trying to break into that van.
It does look like he's breaking into that van.
- 911.
- Hi, there.
So, do you like spy on Ann?
From the pit?
I just like being nearby.
That way if she wants me back,
I could be at her house in two seconds, before she changes her mind.
I don't really know how healthy that is.
You aren't even dating anymore.
She might be dating somebody else.
- Is she?
- What?
- Is she dating somebody else?
- What?
- She's dating somebody else?
- I didn't say that.
- Who is she dating?
- Nobody.
Mark.
It's cool.
My God!
641 to base *style.
I'm at the vehicle now.
How are you doing tonight?
I'm all right, officer.
How are you?
I'm responding to a 911 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
I need you to step out and show me some i.d.
It's okay, my name's Tom Haverford.
I work for the Parks Department.
I got locked out of the van.
I had to jimmy my way back in.
Why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some I.d.?
I just told you my i.d., so what's the crime here?
Parking while Indian?
There's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles.
All right, fine.
Here's my I.d.
Nice job, Paul Blart.
Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into locker?
I'm very close to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
- Step out of the van.
- I'll step out of your mama's van.
I didn't do anything!
I'm a city employee.
- Come on!
- Calm down.
Motion sensors.
My God.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Cops took him.
What?
- My God.
- Ann and Mark!
It's Ann and Mark.
We caught a criminal.
Do you know about this?
He was breaking into this van, and they dragged him away.
It was crazy.
Right here.
What are you doing here?
If you could stop writing for a second and focus here, 'cause...
Ma'am.
As I've already told you , this is a police matter.
It doesn't seem to matter to the police.
- Nice job with that, but listen...
- Let me ask you a question.
Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they get into their own van?
That's not what happened.
Could you please go home, get some sleep and let this matter be resolved?
Let's just go home.
Let's go home.
- No!
- Let's just go home.
Easy.
- Come with me.
- I'd like to come with you.
Your friend, he acted like an ass.
And he didn't give me a choice.
Your name's Dave?
Can I call you Dave?
My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on...
I hate to break it to you.
You really stepped in it.
What?
I'm a government employee, and so is your prisoner.
If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here.
Kicking down your doors.
That's right, you heard me.

Do I stutter?
It wasn't just his behavior.
I think your friend might be a pervert.
That's what people think when they first meet him
- but he's all talk.
- I'm being serious.
We searched the van, and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date.
We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy.
Tom and I were in that van together.
We were staking out the community garden because somebody planted marijuana in it.
I brought the candy, a lot of it because I love it.
I took the pictures.
My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
It's been a very long night.
But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail.
Well, they're gonna release him.
In a little while.
Thank God.
Should I get you home right now?
You two go ahead.
I'm gonna stay here and wait for Tom.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Prison changes a man.
I think he'll wanna see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Well, OK, then.
See you, Leslie.
Yo.
I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
You ready?
I was born ready.
I'm Ron ***** Swanson.
Easy.
Care...
Careful!
Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in.
Terrible things happened last time.
So I guess I'll just... see you tomorrow.
Bye.
You kind of kissed me.
Yes, I did, and now we both have herpes.
I'll see you later.
- Thanks for waiting.
Appreciate it.
- Mother Teresa.
It's not your chocolate.
Don't... get your hands off that.
- Wake up.
- What?
Is this your house?
Where are we?
You're awake?
- Thanks for the coat.
- It's no problem, you can keep it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I need that for my uniform.
But I can give you a ride.
We'll talk about the coat.
- I can't give it to you.
Understand?
- OK.
So where's that marijuana at?
It's down in the garden.
Good meeting you, man.
Should grab a drink some time.
I hope Ann and Mark got home okay.
That's all that matters.
That Ann is home, and she's okay.
And that Mark is also okay, and he is in his home.
Just important that they're both in their homes.
Mark's an idiot.
You could do a lot better than him.
Forget about him.
Thanks, Tom.
I didn't mean me.
Keep it in your pants, Knope.
I swear to God, it actually... it was there.
These are... carrots.
You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Is that the house there where your best friend lives?
Where she saw the van from?
I get it.
What?
You wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date.
I did not.
- There actually was weed here.
- It's okay.
I think it's kind of cute.
I like Miss Knope.
I gotta say when I first met her, I didn't care much for her, because, like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable.
Miss Knope was attractive to me as a man.
I was attracted to her in her demeanor.
I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
What a crazy night.
Partner?
Want to go get some breakfast?
What?
No.
Take me home.
What is wrong with you?
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on!
I wonder if mini golf is open.
Home!
Ann-danawicz, what are you guys doing?
Eating?
Love it.
Just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night.
That was cool.
Peace.
We didn't think you were a pervert.
We thought you were a criminal.
For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert.
I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
Oh, my God.
I'm so fine with it, Ann.
Seriously.
It's so fine.
As long as you and I are cool.
You know my code.
Hoes before bros.
Uteruses before duderuses.
Got it.
Ovaries before brovaries.
You make such good coffee.
Look, I know you're saying you're okay with it, but I've been in this position before, and I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't, actually.
It was kind of weird.
But the thing is, Mark isn't my ex.
You know, we slept together six years ago.
Anyway, I'm over it.
Or am I?
I'm just kidding.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
(EXCLAIMS)
LESLIE:
This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
A community garden, right in the middle of the pit.
We're encouraging people to just come out and plant whatever they want.
And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
It's so hot.

People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
And Tom is our master horticulturist.
He knows all the scientific names for everything.
Right, Tom?
Yeah.
Like this.
What's this, Tom?
Those are, of course, tomatoes, or Soulja Boy Tell 'Ems.
Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of any of our plants,
I just give her the names of rappers.
And those over there?
Those are some Diddys.
Those are some Bone Thugs-n-Harmony-ums right here.
Growing beautifully.
Those Ludacrises are coming in great.
Look, someone planted something new.
What's this?
What do you think, carrots?
If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.
Maybe some kind of spice?
Yeah.
You know, Leslie, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, just roll it up into a joint and smoke it.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Ron, did you get my texts?
No.
Did you get my e-mails?
Mmm-mmm.
Did you see that I paged you?
I did not.
Did you check your voicemail?
I didn't.
We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
Okay.
Call the cops.
That'll leak to the press.
Then there'll be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding.
You don't have funding.
And we never will if this gets out.
Look, I will call the cops, but just give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?
Sure.
Thank you.
(SOFTLY) And listen, if this thing blows up,
I was never here.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
I have a hernia.
I've had it for a while.
And I've been ignoring it, successfully.
But this morning,
I made the mistake of sneezing.
(SNEEZES)
(GROANS)
But as long as I sit still and don't move my head, or torso,
I'm good, I got this.
We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Who is this person?
Who is this kingpin?
It's a 13-year-old kid named Stevie, who likes to get high, and make his Transformers look like they're having sex together.
I would like to be President someday, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.
I ate a brownie once.
At a party in college.
It was intense.
It was kind of indescribable, actually.
I felt like I was floating.
Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie.
It was just an insanely good brownie.
You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal.
'Cause we flip the headline, and it's not
"Community Garden Infested With Pot."
It's "Brave Public Servants Rid Neighborhood of Drugs,
"Earn Praise from Mayor, comma, Everyone."
We got to catch this guy.
Get the van, meet me at 7:00.
It's stakeout time.
April?
Yeah?
Get my lunch for me, please.
Okay.
Like, order you something?
No, get it.
From there.
Is this some kind of weird power trip?
Please.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
You're welcome.
LESLIE:
I have stakeout supplies.
This is stuff that we're probably going to need.
We have notepads, pencils and pencil case.
Shakable whipped cream.
Cameras.
Pork.
And candy necklaces.
It's like we're real police.
And I made us a mix CD.
It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
It's mostly Sting.
And look, I put our faces on there.
It's really cool.
Are you going to wear that shirt?
Yeah.
You like it?
Tommy Hilfiger?
No.
Tom Haverford.
I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
Here you go.
Everyone thinks it's Tommy Hilfiger.
Well, here.
You should be wearing something like this.
Take this.
Wear black.
Black is what you wear on a stakeout.
Okay, I have to figure out how this works.
Just let me focus up on this.
Pretty bummed this fits.
Okay, now I need to just take a test shot and see how this goes.
Test shot.
You ready?
Just focus up on the pit.
All right.
Stop.
Focus up right where the...
Stop.
Focus up right where the weed is...
Stop.
Stop.
ANN:
Leslie swears it's okay.
So I'm going out with Mark.
I got to get back out there.
When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie.
And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Oh, look.
It's Mark.
(CAMERA CLICKING)
What are you doing?
What?
I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Good.
Yeah.
Hey, Ann.
Hey.
So, you ready to go?
Oh, no.
I need another hour to get ready.
Seriously?
'Cause I think the movie starts in like...
Oh, you're joking around right now.
Wow.
This is going to be fun.
Yeah, well, you know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains, too.
Ew!
Silly.
(CAMERA CLICKING)
TOM:
Whoa!
Are they dating now?
Brendanawicz is the man.
This is Brendanawicz's life.
Hot chick from the newspaper, hot chick from the post office, hot chick from the hospital.
Her name's Ann.
You know her name.
Her name's Ann.
I'm just saying.
Nobody turns him down.
I did.
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said,
"No, sir, Mark Brendanawicz.
I don't need your business here."
LESLIE: (WHISPERING) Get down.
(CAMERA CLICKING)
(VACUUM CLEANER WHIRRING)
Working late?
Yeah.
(LESLIE IMITATING GUITAR)
(SINGING) Shovel guitar, shovel guitar
Somebody wants to play shovel guitar
Leslie's been playing shovel guitar for about an hour now.
Longer.
Bucket drum, bucket drum
You're not from here, right?
No.
I'm from South Carolina.
But you moved to South Carolina from where?
My mother's uterus.
But you were conceived in Libya, right?
Wow.
No.
I was conceived in America.
My parents are Indian.
Where did the name 'Haverford' come from?
My birth name is Darwish Sabir Ismael Gani, and I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny-sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics.
What about Barack Obama?
Okay, yeah, fine, Barack Obama.
If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was going to be elected President, yeah, maybe I wouldn't have changed it.
(RUSTLING)
Oh, did you hear that noise?
Oh, my God.
It's the kingpin!
Write this down.
Okay, white male, light brown hair.
TOM:
Just take pictures.
LESLIE:
Oh, my God, it looks like Andy.
That is Andy.
That is Andy.
Andy is the kingpin.
Andy.
Come here.
Oh, hey, you guys.
What are you doing here?
It's so good to see you.
(SHUSHING) Quietly.
(WHISPERS) What happened?
You're living in the pit now?
For now, yeah.
It's awesome.
Somebody just planted a garden down there.
Fruits and vegetables, so I'm getting a lot of vitamins...
But that's our community garden.
Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed next to the tomatoes.
Oh, don't look at me.
There's weed down there?
I thought that was the tops of carrots.
Right, I know.
Me, too.
Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?
So why don't you come to the van and help us?
We're trying to catch the guy.
And maybe you could tell us what you've seen.
I was supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.
He's like 20 minutes late.
All right.
Let's do it.
Okay.
APRIL:
Do you live here?
April?
Yeah.
Do you live here?
No.
Catch.
Yeah, I thought so.
(SIGHS) I went home, but I had this strange feeling that there was something wrong with you, so I came back.
It's just a minor medical issue.
AIDS?
No.
I'm safe.
Blindness?
No.
Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee?
I have a hernia.
Do you have syphilis?
I said it's a hernia.
I know.
It's possible to have two things.
Do you need a ride to the hospital?
Yes, please.
Okay.
But I rode my bike here, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon.
Thank you.
Bye.
Are you still here?
Yeah.
I just wanted to see if you could tell.
Are you still here?
ANDY:
It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Man, oh, man.
So how's Ann?
She's doing good?
Oh, I miss her so much, it's ridiculous.
How's she doing?
Doing good tonight.
She's out on a...
Ann is great.
And I bet she really misses you.
(YAWNING) I'm going to need more of these if I'm going to stay up tonight.
Is that candy?
Yeah, it's a necklace, made out of candy.
You want one?
Oh, all right.
Great.
All I've had is fruits and vegetables, for weeks now.
Hmm.
Oh, my God!
You know, there's a string in there.
Not in this one.
Instant sugar high!
Sugar high!
Sugar hit high!
Sugar high!
High!
Oh!
Are you okay?
(EXCLAIMING)
Sugar slam!
Maybe we should get you something more substantial to eat.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm in.
TOM:
Hey, bring me back two cheeseburgers and a green tea.
Oh, come on.
You got to be kidding me.
ANN:
So, that was fun.
MARK:
Yeah.
It really was.
Surprisingly fun.
You know what?
I have been a perfect gentleman this evening.
In fact, watch this.
I would like you to now please invite me in for a nightcap.
Not a chance.
No, no, no.
Just...
Watch what I'm going to do.
Oh, okay.
Just ask me in for a nightcap.
Will you come in for a nightcap?
Yes, I will.
No, no!
Damn!
Drat!
I was going to plan to not...
Wait, wait, wait.
To say no.
Look, that guy's trying to break into that van.
You know what, it does look like he's breaking into that van.
I just...
(TOM WHOOPS)
FEMALE OPERATOR: 9- 1-1.
Hi, there.
So, Andy, do you, like, spy on Ann from the pit?
No.
No.
I just like being nearby.
That way, if she wants me back,
I can be at her house, like, in two seconds, before she changes her mind.
I don't really know how healthy that is.
I mean, you guys aren't even dating anymore.
She might be dating somebody else.
Is she?
What?
Is she dating somebody else?
Huh?
What?
You just said Ann might be dating somebody else.
Is she?
I didn't say that.
Who is she dating?
Nobody.
Mark.
That's cool.
Oh, my God!
641 to base, I'm at the vehicle now.
How you doing tonight, sir?
I'm all right, Officer.
How are you?
I'm responding to a 9-1-1 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
I need you to step out and show me some ID.
No, it's okay.
My name is Tom Haverford.
I work for the Parks Department.
I just got locked out of the van.
I had to jimmy my way back in.
Well, why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some ID.
Well, I just told you my ID.
So, what's the crime here?
Parking while Indian?
No, there's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles.
All right, fine.
Here's my ID.
Nice job, Paul Blart.
Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into Lady Foot Locker?
Hey.
I'm very close right now to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
Step out of the van.
I'll step out of your mama's van.
(SCREAMING)
I didn't do anything!
I'm a city employee, man!
Come on!
Leslie!
Motion sensors.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me!
What are you doing?
What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Cops took him.
What?
Oh, my God!
ANDY:
Ann and Mark!
Andy!
(WHISPERS) It's Ann and Mark!
LESLIE:
Andy?
ANN:
Leslie?
Oh!
MARK:
Leslie Knope.
LESLIE:
Hey!
Hey!
LESLIE:
Wow.
We caught a criminal.
Do you know about this?
Yeah, he was breaking into this van and they dragged him away.
It was crazy.
MARK:
Right here.
What are you doing here?
If you could just stop writing for a second, and just focus here, because...
Ma'am, ma'am, as I've told you several times already, this is a police matter.
Well, it doesn't seem to matter to the police!
Okay.
Nice job with that.
But let's...
Let me ask you a question.
Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van?
No.
And thankfully, that's not what happened.
Now, could you please go home, and get some sleep, and let this matter be resolved.
MARK:
Thank you, Officer.
Let's just go home, Leslie.
Yeah, let's go home.
MARK:
Let's just go home.
No!
No!
MARK:
Let's just go home.
No!
Easy!
No.
No, no, no, no, no!
Leslie...
Okay, come with me, please.
Fine.
I'd like to come with you.
Your friend, he acted like an ass.
And you got to believe me, he didn't give me a choice.
Your name's Dave, right?
Can I call you Dave?
My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on it 50-50.
Hate to break it to you, Dave.
You really stepped in it.
What?
I'm a government employee, David, and so is your prisoner.
If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here, kicking down your doors.
Yeah, that's right.
You heard me.
Ron Swanson.
What branch of government are you in?
Parks and Recreation.
Parks and Recreation?
Yes.
Do I stutter?
Look, Ms. Knope, it wasn't just his behavior, okay?
I think your friend might be some kind of a pervert.
No. (SIGHS) Look, that's what people think when they first meet him, but he's all talk.
It's just...
No, I'm being serious.
We searched the van and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date.
We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy.
Okay, look.
Tom and I were in that van together.
We were staking out the community garden, because somebody planted marijuana in it.
I brought the candy and I brought a lot of it, because I love candy.
I took the pictures.
My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
It's been a very long night.
But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail.
(SIGHS) Well, they're going to release him in a little while.
Thank God.
Should I get you guys home right now?
You know, you two go ahead.
I'm going to stay here and wait for Tom.
Are you sure?
Yeah, prison changes a man.
I think he'll probably want to see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Well, okay, then.
See you, Leslie.
(GROANS)
Yo.
I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
You ready?
I was born ready.
I'm Ron (BLEEP) Swanson.
Easy.
Care...
(GROANS)
Careful.
(EXHALES)
(EXCLAIMS) Take...
(CRASHING)
Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in.
Terrible things happened last time.
(LAUGHS)
So, I guess I'll just see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Hey.
You kind of kissed me.
Yes, I did!
And now we both have herpes.
I'll see you later.
(LAUGHS)
Leslie.
Thanks for waiting.
I appreciate it.
Mother Teresa, it's not your chocolate.
Don't...
Get your hands off that.
Wake up.
What?
Is this your house?
Where are we?
DAVE:
Hey.
You're awake.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for the coat.
It's no problem.
You can keep it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I need that for my uniform.
But I can give you a ride back to your car.
Okay.
And we'll talk about the coat.
I can't give it to you.
Do you understand?
Okay.
So, where's that marijuana at?
It's down in the garden.
Good meeting you, man!
We should grab a drink or something sometime.
(SIGHS) I just hope that Ann and Mark got home okay.
That's all that matters, you know?
That Ann is home and she's okay.
And that Mark is also okay and he is in his home.
Just important that they're both in their homes...
Leslie.
Mark's an idiot.
You can do a lot better than him.
Forget about him.
Thanks, Tom.
I didn't mean me.
Keep it in your pants, Knope.
I swear to God, it actually...
It was there...
These are carrots.
Duh!
You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Is that the house there, where your best friend lives?
Where she saw the van from?
Yeah.
Okay.
I get it.
What?
Well, you wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date.
No, I did not.
There actually was weed here...
It's okay.
I think it's kind of cute.
I like Miss Knope.
I liked her.
I got to say, I...
When I first met her I didn't care much for her, because like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable.
Miss Knope was attractive to me.
As a man, I was attracted to her in her demeanor.
I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
Can we not...
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
(SIGHS) What a crazy night.
Huh, partner?
Want to go get some breakfast?
What?
No!
Take me home.
What's wrong with you?
(SOFA ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on.
I wonder if mini golf is open.
TOM:
Home!
Especially if you're going to...
I know.
Anndanawicz!
What're you guys doing?
Eating?
Love it.
Oh, hey, just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night.
That was cool.
Peace!
We didn't think you were a pervert, we thought you were a criminal.
For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert.
I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
My God, I am so fine with it, Ann, seriously.
It's so fine.
As long as you and I are cool.
You know my code.
Hos before bros.
Uteruses before duderuses.
- Got it.
Ovaries before brovaries.
- You make such good coffee.
- Look,
{\pos(192,240)}I know you're saying you're okay{\ with it,} but I've been in this position before.
{\pos(192,240)}And I had a friend who dated an ex,
{\pos(192,240)}and I said I was okay, but I wasn't actually.
{\pos(192,240)}
- It was kind of weird.
- The thing is, Mark isn't my ex.
{\pos(192,240)}{\You know,}We slept together six years ago.
{\pos(192,240)}Anyway, I'm over it.
Or am I?
I'm just kidding.
This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
A community garden.
Right in the middle of the pit.
We're encouraging people to{\ just} come out and plant whatever they want.
And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
It's so hot.
I had to get some more iced tea.
People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
And Tom is our master horticulturist.
He knows all the scientific names{\ for everything}.
Right, Tom?
- Like this.
What's this{\, Tom}?
- Those are, of course, tomatoes.
Or souljaboy tellems.
Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names {\of any }of our plants,
I just give her the names of rappers.
- And those over there?
- Those are some diddies.
There's some bonethugs and harmoniums right here.
- Growing beautifully.
- Those ludacrises are coming in great.
Look.
Someone planted something new.
What's this?
What do you think?
Carrots?
If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.
{\Maybe }Some kind of spice?
You know{\, Leslie}, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, is roll it up into a joint and smoke it.

{\pos(120,260)}Did you get my emails?
{\pos(120,260)}Did you see that I paged you?
{\pos(120,260)}I did not.
{\pos(120,260)}Did you check your voicemail?
{\pos(120,260)}I didn't.
{\pos(120,260)}We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
{\pos(120,260)}
- Call the cops.
- That'll leak to the press.
Then there'll be an investigation.
And they'll find my fingerprints{\ on the manure}.
{\pos(120,260)}
- And then we'll lose our funding.
- You don't have{\ funding}.
{\pos(110,260)}And we never will if this gets out.
{\pos(120,260)}Look, I will call the cops, but {\just }give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?

But as long as I sit still and don't move my head
or torso,
I'm good, I got this.
We need to find out who we're dealing with.{\Who is this person?
}
Who is this kingpin?
It's a 13-year-old kid named Stevie who likes to get high and make his transformers look like they're having sex{\ together}.
I would like to be president some day, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.
I ate a brownie once.
At a party in college.
It was intense.
It was kind of indescribable, actually.
I felt like I was floating.
Turns out there wasn't any pot in it{\the brownie}.
It was just an insanely good brownie.
You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal.
'cause we flip the headline.
And it's not "community garden infested with pot", it's "brave public servants
"rid neighborhood of drugs,
"earn praise from mayor, comma, everyone."
We gotta catch this guy.
Get the van, meet me at 7:00.
It's stakeout time.
Get my lunch for me, please.
Okay, like order you something?
No, get it... from there.
Is this some kind of weird power trip?
Please.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
You're welcome.
I have stakeout supplies.
This is stuff that we're probably gonna need.
We have notepads, pencils, and pencil case.
Shakable whipped cream.
Cameras.
Gorp.
And... candy necklaces.
It's like we're real police.
And I made us a mix cd.
It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
It's mostly Sting.

- It's really cool.
- Are you gonna wear that shirt?
Yeah.

- {\You just said Ann might be}She's dating somebody else{\.
Is she}?
- I didn't say that.
- Who is she dating?
- Nobody.
Mark.
It's cool.
My God!
{\pos(210,265)}641 to base *style.
I'm at the vehicle now.
How are you doing tonight{\, sir}?
I'm all right, officer.
How are you?
I'm responding to a 911 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
I need you to step out and show me some i.d.
It's okay, my name's Tom Haverford.
I work for the Parks Department.
I got locked out of the van.
I had to jimmy my way back in.
Why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some I.d.?
I just told you my i.d., so what's the crime here?
Parking while Indian?
There's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles.
All right, fine.
Here's my I.d.
Nice job, Paul Blart.
Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into{\ lady foot} locker?
I'm very close{\ right now} to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
{\pos(220,265)}
- Step out of the van.
- I'll step out of your mama's van.
{\pos(220,265)}{\
- What's wrong?
- }I didn't do anything!
I'm a city employee{\, man}.
- Come on!
- Calm down.
Motion sensors.
My God.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Cops took him.
What?
- My God.
- Ann and Mark!
It's Ann and Mark.
We caught a criminal.
Do you know about this?
He was breaking into this van, and they dragged him away.
It was crazy.
Right here.
What are you doing here?
If you could {\just } stop writing for a second and {\just }focus here, 'cause...
Ma'am.
As I've already told you {\several times }, this is a police matter.
It doesn't seem to matter to the police.
{\pos(192,240)}
- Nice job with that, but listen...
- Let me ask you a question.
{\pos(192,240)}Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department
{\pos(192,240)}to arrest people when they{\ try to} get into their own van?
{\pos(192,240)}{\And, thankfully,}That's not what happened.
{\pos(192,240)}{\So now }Could you please go home,
{\pos(192,250)}get some sleep and let this matter be resolved?
{\Thank you, officer.}Let's just go home.
Let's go home.
- No!
- Let's just go home.
Easy.
- Come with me{\, please}.
- {\Fine, }I'd like to come with you.
Your friend, he acted like an ass.
And{\ you got to believe me,} he didn't give me a choice.
Your name's Dave{\, right}?
Can I call you Dave?
My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on...
I hate to break it to you.
You really stepped in it.
What?
I'm a government employee, and so is your prisoner.
If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here.
Kicking down your doors.
That's right, you heard me.
What branch of government are you in?
Parks and Recreation.
Do I stutter?
It wasn't just his behavior.
I think your friend might be {\some kind of }a pervert.
{ o, look, }That's what people think when they first meet him
- but he's all talk.
- I'm being serious.
We searched the van, and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date.
We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy.
Tom and I were in that van together.
We were staking out the community garden because somebody planted marijuana in it.
I brought the candy, {\and I brought }a lot of it because I love it.
I took the pictures.
My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
It's been a very long night.
But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail.
Well, they're gonna release him.
In a little while.
Thank God.
Should I get you home right now?
{\You knowwhat, }You two go ahead.
I'm gonna stay here and wait for Tom.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Prison changes a man.
I think he'll wanna see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Well, OK, then.
See you, Leslie.
Yo.
I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
You ready?
I was born ready.
I'm Ron ***** Swanson.
Easy.
Care...
Careful!
Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in.
Terrible things happened last time.
So I guess I'll just... see you tomorrow.
Bye.
You kind of kissed me.
Yes, I did, and now we both have herpes.
I'll see you later.
- Thanks for waiting.
Appreciate it.
- Mother Teresa.
It's not your chocolate.
Don't... get your hands off that.
- Wake up.
- What?
Is this your house?
Where are we?
You're awake?
- Thanks for the coat.
- It's no problem, you can keep it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I need that for my uniform.
But I can give you a ride{\back to your car}.
We'll talk about the coat.
- I can't give it to you. {\You }Understand?
- OK.
So where's that marijuana at?
It's down in the garden.
Good meeting you, man.
Should grab a drink {\or something}some time.
I hope Ann and Mark got home okay.
That's all that matters{\, you know}.
That Ann is home, and she's okay.
And that Mark is also okay, and he is in his home.
Just important that they're both in their homes.
Mark's an idiot.
You could do a lot better than him.
Forget about him.
Thanks, Tom.
I didn't mean me.
Keep it in your pants, Knope.
I swear to God, it actually... it was there.
These are... carrots.
You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Is that the house there where your best friend lives?
Where she saw the van from?
I get it.
What?
You wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date.
I did not.
- There actually was weed here.
- It's okay.
I think it's kind of cute.
I like Miss Knope.{\I liked her.}
I gotta say when I first met her, I didn't care much for her, because, like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable.
Miss Knope was attractive to me as a man.
I was attracted to her in her demeanor.
I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
{\Can we... }I don't want to talk about this anymore.
What a crazy night.
Partner?
Want to go get some breakfast?
What?
No.
Take me home.
What is wrong with you?
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on!
I wonder if mini golf is open.
Home!
Ann-danawicz, what are you guys doing?
Eating?
Love it.
Just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night.
That was cool.
Peace.
We didn't think you were a pervert.
We thought you were a criminal.
For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert.
I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
Oh, my God.
I'm so fine with it, Ann.
Seriously.
It's so fine.
As long as you and I are cool.
You know my code.
Hoes before bros.
- Uteruses before duderuses.
- Got it.
Ovaries before brovaries.
You make such good coffee.
Look, I know you're saying you're okay with it, but I've been in this position before, and I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't, actually.
It was kind of weird.
But the thing is, Mark isn't my ex.
You know, we slept together six years ago.
Anyway, I'm over it.
Or am I?
I'm just kidding.
This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
A community garden, right in the middle of the pit.
We're encouraging people to just come out and plant whatever they want.
And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
It's so hot.
I had to get some more iced tea.
People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
And Tom is our master horticulturist.
He knows all the scientific names for everything.
Right, Tom?
- Yeah.
- Like this.
What's this, Tom?
Those are, of course, tomatoes, or Soulja Boy Tell 'Ems.
Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of any of our plants,
I just give her the names of rappers.
And those over there?
Those are some Diddys.
Those are some Bone Thugs-n-Harmony-ums right here.
Growing beautifully.
Those Ludacrises are coming in great.
Look, someone planted something new.
What's this?
What do you think, carrots?
If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.
Maybe some kind of spice?
Yeah.
You know, Leslie, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, just roll it up into a joint and smoke it.
Ron, did you get my texts?
No.
- Did you get my emails?
- Mnm-mn
Did you see that I paged you?
- I did not.
- Did you check your voicemail?
I didn't.
We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
Okay.
Call the cops.
That'll leak to the press.
Then there'll be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding.
You don't have funding.
And we never will if this gets out.
Look, I will call the cops, but just give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
And listen, if this thing blows up,
I was never here.
I have a hernia.
I've had it for a while.
And I've been ignoring it, successfully.
But this morning,
I made the mistake of sneezing.
But as long as I sit still and don't move my head, or torso,
I'm good, I got this.
We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Who is this person?
Who is this kingpin?
It's a 13-year-old kid named Stevie, who likes to get high, and make his Transformers look like they're having sex together.
I would like to be President someday, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.
I ate a brownie once.
At a party in college.
It was intense.
It was kind of indescribable, actually.
I felt like I was floating.
Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie.
It was just an insanely good brownie.
You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal.
'Cause we flip the headline, and it's not
"Community Garden Infested With Pot."
It's "Brave Public Servants Rid Neighborhood of Drugs,
"Earn Praise from Mayor, comma, Everyone."
We got to catch this guy.
Get the van, meet me at 7:00.
It's stakeout time.
April?
- Yeah?
- Get my lunch for me, please.
Okay.
Like, order you something?
No, get it.
From there.
Is this some kind of weird power trip?
Please.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
You're welcome.
I have stakeout supplies.
This is stuff that we're probably going to need.
We have notepads, pencils and pencil case.
Shakable whipped cream.
Cameras.
Pork.
And candy necklaces.
It's like we're real police.
And I made us a mix CD.
It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
It's mostly Sting.
And look, I put our faces on there.
It's really cool.
Are you going to wear that shirt?
Yeah.
You like it?
Tommy Hilfiger?
No.
Tom Haverford.
I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
Here you go.
Everyone thinks it's Tommy Hilfiger.
Well, here.
You should be wearing something like this.
Take this.
Wear black.
Black is what you wear on a stakeout.
Okay, I have to figure out how this works.
Just let me focus up on this.
Pretty bummed this fits.
Okay, now I need to just take a test shot and see how this goes.
Test shot.
You ready?
Just focus up on the pit.
All right.
- Stop.
- Focus up right where the...
- Stop.
- Focus up right where the weed is...
Stop.
Stop.
Leslie swears it's okay.
So I'm going out with Mark.
I got to get back out there.
When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie.
And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Oh, look.
It's Mark.
- What are you doing?
- What?
I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Good.
Yeah.
- Hey, Ann.
- Hey.
So, you ready to go?
Oh, no.
I need another hour to get ready.
Seriously?
'Cause I think the movie starts in like...
Oh, you're joking around right now.
Wow.
This is going to be fun.
Yeah, well, you know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains, too.
- Ew!
- Silly.
Whoa!
Are they dating now?
Brendanawicz is the man.
This is Brendanawicz's life.
Hot chick from the newspaper, hot chick from the post office, hot chick from the hospital.
Her name's Ann.
You know her name.
Her name's Ann.
I'm just saying.
Nobody turns him down.
I did.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I did.
We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said,
"No, sir, Mark Brendanawicz.
I don't need your business here."
Get down.
Working late?
Yeah.
Shovel guitar, shovel guitar
Somebody wants to play shovel guitar
Leslie's been playing shovel guitar for about an hour now.
Longer.
Bucket drum, bucket drum
You're not from here, right?
No.
I'm from South Carolina.
But you moved to South Carolina from where?
My mother's uterus.
But you were conceived in Libya, right?
Wow.
No.
I was conceived in America.
My parents are Indian.
Where did the name 'Haverford' come from?
My birth name is Darwish Sabir Ismael Gani, and I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny-sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics.
What about Barack Obama?
Okay, yeah, fine, Barack Obama.
If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was going to be elected President, yeah, maybe I wouldn't have changed it.
Oh, did you hear that noise?
Oh, my God.
It's the kingpin!
Write this down.
Okay, white male, light brown hair.
Just take pictures.
Oh, my God, it looks like Andy.
That is Andy.
That is Andy.
Andy is the kingpin.
Andy.
Come here.
Oh, hey, you guys.
What are you doing here?
It's so good to see you.
Quietly.
What happened?
You're living in the pit now?
For now, yeah.
It's awesome.
Somebody just planted a garden down there.
Fruits and vegetables, so I'm getting a lot of vitamins...
But that's our community garden.
Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed next to the tomatoes.
Oh, don't look at me.
There's weed down there?
I thought that was the tops of carrots.
Right, I know.
Me, too.
Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?
So why don't you come to the van and help us?
We're trying to catch the guy.
And maybe you could tell us what you've seen.
I was supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.
He's like 20 minutes late.
- All right.
Let's do it.
- Okay.
Do you live here?
April?
Yeah.
Do you live here?
No.
Catch.
Yeah, I thought so.
I went home, but I had this strange feeling that there was something wrong with you, so I came back.
It's just a minor medical issue.
AIDS?
No.
I'm safe.
Blindness?
No.
Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee?
I have a hernia.
Do you have syphilis?
I said it's a hernia.
I know.
It's possible to have two things.
Do you need a ride to the hospital?
Yes, please.
Okay.
But I rode my bike here, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon.
Thank you.
Bye.
Are you still here?
Yeah.
I just wanted to see if you could tell.
Are you still here?
It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Man, oh, man.
So how's Ann?
She's doing good?
Oh, I miss her so much, it's ridiculous.
How's she doing?
Doing good tonight.
She's out on a...
Ann is great.
And I bet she really misses you.
I'm going to need more of these if I'm going to stay up tonight.
Is that candy?
Yeah, it's a necklace, made out of candy.
You want one?
Oh, all right.
Great.
All I've had is fruits and vegetables, for weeks now.
Hmm.
Oh, my God!
You know, there's a string in there.
Not in this one.
Instant sugar high!
Sugar high!
Sugar hit high!
Sugar high!
High!
Oh!
Are you okay?
Sugar slam!
Maybe we should get you something more substantial to eat.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm in.
Hey, bring me back two cheeseburgers and a green tea.
Oh, come on.
You got to be kidding me.
So, that was fun.
Yeah.
It really was.
Surprisingly fun.
You know what?
I have been a perfect gentleman this evening.
In fact, watch this.
I would like you to now please invite me in for a nightcap.
- Not a chance.
- No, no, no.
Just...
Watch what I'm going to do.
- Oh, okay.
- Just ask me in for a nightcap.
Will you come in for a nightcap?
Yes, I will.
No, no!
Damn!
Drat!
I was going to plan to not...
- Wait, wait, wait.
- To say no.
Look, that guy's trying to break into that van.
You know what, it does look like he's breaking into that van.
I just...
- 9- 1-1.
- Hi, there.
So, Andy, do you, like, spy on Ann from the pit?
No.
No.
I just like being nearby.
That way, if she wants me back,
I can be at her house, like, in two seconds, before she changes her mind.
I don't really know how healthy that is.
I mean, you guys aren't even dating anymore.
She might be dating somebody else.
- Is she?
- What?
- Is she dating somebody else?
- Huh?
What?
You just said Ann might be dating somebody else.
- Is she?
- I didn't say that.
- Who is she dating?
- Nobody.
Mark.
That's cool.
Oh, my God!
641 to base, I'm at the vehicle now.
How you doing tonight, sir?
I'm all right, Officer.
How are you?
I'm responding to a 9-1-1 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
I need you to step out and show me some ID.
No, it's okay.
My name is Tom Haverford.
I work for the Parks Department.
I just got locked out of the van.
I had to jimmy my way back in.
Well, why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some ID.
Well, I just told you my ID.
So, what's the crime here?
Parking while Indian?
No, there's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles.
All right, fine.
Here's my ID.
Nice job, Paul Blart.
Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into Lady Foot Locker?
Hey.
I'm very close right now to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
Step out of the van.
I'll step out of your mama's van.
I didn't do anything!
I'm a city employee, man!
Come on!
Leslie!
Motion sensors.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me!
What are you doing?
What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Cops took him.
What?
Oh, my God!
- Ann and Mark!
- Andy!
- It's Ann and Mark!
- Andy?
- Leslie?
- Oh!
- Leslie Knope.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Wow.
We caught a criminal.
Do you know about this?
Yeah, he was breaking into this van and they dragged him away.
It was crazy.
Right here.
What are you doing here?
If you could just stop writing for a second, and just focus here, because...
Ma'am, ma'am, as I've told you several times already, this is a police matter.
Well, it doesn't seem to matter to the police!
Okay.
Nice job with that.
But let's...
Let me ask you a question.
Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van?
No.
And thankfully, that's not what happened.
Now, could you please go home, and get some sleep, and let this matter be resolved.
Thank you, Officer.
Let's just go home, Leslie.
- Yeah, let's go home.
- Let's just go home.
- No!
No!
- Let's just go home.
- No!
- Easy!
- No.
No, no, no, no, no!
- Leslie...
Okay, come with me, please.
Fine.
I'd like to come with you.
Your friend, he acted like an ass.
And you got to believe me, he didn't give me a choice.
Your name's Dave, right?
Can I call you Dave?
My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on it 50-50.
Hate to break it to you, Dave.
You really stepped in it.
- What?
- I'm a government employee, David, and so is your prisoner.
If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here, kicking down your doors.
Yeah, that's right.
You heard me.
Ron Swanson.
What branch of government are you in?
Parks and Recreation.
Parks and Recreation?
Yes.
Do I stutter?
Look, Ms. Knope, it wasn't just his behavior, okay?
I think your friend might be some kind of a pervert.
No.
Look, that's what people think when they first meet him, but he's all talk.
It's just...
No, I'm being serious.
We searched the van and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date.
We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy.
Okay, look.
Tom and I were in that van together.
We were staking out the community garden, because somebody planted marijuana in it.
I brought the candy and I brought a lot of it, because I love candy.
I took the pictures.
My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
It's been a very long night.
But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail.
Well, they're going to release him in a little while.
Thank God.
Should I get you guys home right now?
You know, you two go ahead.
I'm going to stay here and wait for Tom.
Are you sure?
Yeah, prison changes a man.
I think he'll probably want to see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Well, okay, then.
See you, Leslie.
Yo.
I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
You ready?
I was born ready.
I'm Ron (fucking) Swanson.
Easy.
Care...
Careful.
Take...
Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in.
Terrible things happened last time.
So, I guess I'll just see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Bye.
Hey.
You kind of kissed me.
Yes, I did!
And now we both have herpes.
I'll see you later.
Leslie.
Thanks for waiting.
I appreciate it.
Mother Teresa, it's not your chocolate.
Don't...
Get your hands off that.
- Wake up.
- What?
Is this your house?
Where are we?
Hey.
You're awake.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for the coat.
It's no problem.
You can keep it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I need that for my uniform.
But I can give you a ride back to your car.
Okay.
And we'll talk about the coat.
I can't give it to you.
Do you understand?
Okay.
So, where's that marijuana at?
It's down in the garden.
Good meeting you, man!
We should grab a drink or something sometime.
I just hope that Ann and Mark got home okay.
That's all that matters, you know?
That Ann is home and she's okay.
And that Mark is also okay and he is in his home.
Just important that they're both in their homes...
Leslie.
Mark's an idiot.
You can do a lot better than him.
Forget about him.
Thanks, Tom.
I didn't mean me.
Keep it in your pants, Knope.
I swear to God, it actually...
It was there...
These are carrots.
Duh!
You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Is that the house there, where your best friend lives?
Where she saw the van from?
Yeah.
Okay.
I get it.
What?
Well, you wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date.
No, I did not.
There actually was weed here...
It's okay.

I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
Can we not...
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
What a crazy night.
Huh, partner?
Want to go get some breakfast?
What?
No!
Take me home.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on.
I wonder if mini golf is open.
Home!
Especially if you're going to...
I know.
Anndanawicz!
What're you guys doing?
Eating?
Love it.
Oh, hey, just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night.
That was cool.
Peace!
We didn't think you were a pervert, we thought you were a criminal.
For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert.
I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
{\My God, }I am so fine with it, Ann, seriously.
It's so fine.
As long as you and I are cool.

Right in the middle of the pit.
We're encouraging people to{\ just} come out and plant whatever they want.
And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
It's so hot.
I had to get some more iced tea.
People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
And Tom is our master horticulturist.
He knows all the scientific names{\ for everything}.
Right, Tom?
- Like this.
What's this{\, Tom}?
- Those are, of course, tomatoes.
Or souljaboy tellems.
Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names {\of any }of our plants,
I just give her the names of rappers.
- And those over there?
- Those are some diddies.
There's some bonethugs and harmoniums right here.
- Growing beautifully.
- Those ludacrises are coming in great.
Look.
Someone planted something new.
What's this?
What do you think?
Carrots?
If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.
{\Maybe }Some kind of spice?
You know{\, Leslie}, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, is roll it up into a joint and smoke it.

- Ron, did you get my text?
{\pos(120,260)}Did you get my emails?
{\pos(120,260)}Did you see that I paged you?
{\pos(120,260)}I did not.
{\pos(120,260)}Did you check your voicemail?
{\pos(120,260)}I didn't.
{\pos(120,260)}We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
{\pos(120,260)}
- Call the cops.
- That'll leak to the press.
Then there'll be an investigation.
And they'll find my fingerprints{\ on the manure}.
{\pos(120,260)}
- And then we'll lose our funding.
- You don't have{\ funding}.
{\pos(110,260)}And we never will if this gets out.
{\pos(120,260)}Look, I will call the cops, but {\just }give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
And listen, if this thing blows up,
{\pos(120,260)}I was never here.
I have a hernia.
{\pos(120,260)}I've had it for a while.
{\pos(120,260)}And I've been ignoring it... {\pos(120,260)}successfully, but this morning,
{\pos(120,260)}I made the mistake of sneezing.
But as long as I sit still and don't move my head
or torso,
I'm good, I got this.
We need to find out who we're dealing with.{\Who is this person?
}
Who is this kingpin?
It's a 13-year-old kid named Stevie who likes to get high and make his transformers look like they're having sex{\ together}.
I would like to be president some day, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.
I ate a brownie once.
At a party in college.
It was intense.
It was kind of indescribable, actually.
I felt like I was floating.
Turns out there wasn't any pot in it{\the brownie}.
It was just an insanely good brownie.
You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal.
'cause we flip the headline.
And it's not "community garden infested with pot", it's "brave public servants
"rid neighborhood of drugs,
"earn praise from mayor, comma, everyone."
We gotta catch this guy.
Get the van, meet me at 7:00.
It's stakeout time.
Get my lunch for me, please.
Okay, like order you something?
No, get it... from there.
Is this some kind of weird power trip?
Please.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
You're welcome.
I have stakeout supplies.
This is stuff that we're probably gonna need.
We have notepads, pencils, and pencil case.
Shakable whipped cream.
Cameras.
Gorp.
And... candy necklaces.
It's like we're real police.
And I made us a mix cd.
It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
It's mostly Sting.
- {\And look, }I put our faces on there.
- It's really cool.
- Are you gonna wear that shirt?
Yeah.
You like it?
Tommy Hilfiger?
No, Tom Haverford.
I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
{\
- Okay, here you go.- }Everyone thinks it's{\ tommy} Hilfiger.
You should be wearing something like this.
Take this.
Wear black.
Black is what you wear in a stakeout.
I have to figure out how this works.
- Just let me focus up on this.
- Pretty bummed this fits.
Okay, now we just need to take a test shot
- and see how this goes.
- Take a test shot.
Ready?
- Focus up on the pit.
All right.
- Stop.
- Focus up right where the...
- Stop.
Focus up right where the weed...
Stop.
Stop.
Leslie swears it's okay.
So I'm going out with Mark.
I got to get back out there.
When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie.
And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Look, it's Mark.
What are you doing?
What?
I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Good.
Are you ready{\ to go}?
Oh, no, I need another hour to get ready.
Seriously?
'Cause I think the movie starts in like...
You're joking around right now.
This is gonna be fun.
{\Yeah, well, }You know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains too.
That was silly.
Are they dating now?
Brendanawicz is the man.
This is Brendanawicz's life:
hot chick from the newspaper, hot chick from the post office, hot chick from the hospital.
Her name's Ann.
You know her name.
Her name's Ann.
I'm just saying, nobody turns him down.
I did.
Yeah, I did.
We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said, "nuh-uh, no, sir, Mark Brendanawicz.
'I don't need your business here."
Get down!
Working late?

Somebody wants to play shovel guitar
Leslie's been playing shovel guitar for about an hour now.

- You're not from here, right?
- No, I'm from South Carolina.
But you moved to South Carolina from where?
- My mother's uterus.
- But you were conceived in Libya{\, right}?
I was conceived in America.
My parents are Indian.
Where did the name Haverford come from?
My birth name is...
Darwish Zubair Ismail Gani.
Then I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny-sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics.
- What about Barack Obama?
- Yeah, fine, Barack Obama.
If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was gonna be elected president,
- Maybe I wouldn't have changed it.
- Did you hear{\ that noise}?
{\Oh, my God, }It's the kingpin.
Write this down.
White male, light brown hair.
Just take pictures.
Oh, my God.
It looks like Andy.
That is Andy.
That is Andy.
Andy is the kingpin.
Andy, come here.
Oh, hey, you guys.
What are you doing here?
It's so good to see you.
- Quietly.
- What happened?
- You're living in the pit now?
- For now, yeah.
It's awesome.
{\pos(192,240)}Somebody planted a garden down there with fruits and vegetables,
{\pos(192,240)}- so I'm getting a lot of vitamins.
- That's our community garden.
{\pos(192,240)}Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed
{\pos(192,240)}next to the tomatoes.
{\pos(192,240)}Don't look at me.
There's weed down there?
{\pos(192,240)}I thought that was{\ the tops} of carrots.
Right, I know.
Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?
Why don't you come{\ to the van and} helping us?
{\We're trying }To catch the guy.
{\Maybe you can}You could tell us what you've seen.
I'm supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.
He's like 20 minutes late.
All right.
Let's do it.
Do you live here?
Yeah, do you live here?
Catch.
Yeah, I thought so.
I went home, but I had this strange feeling that there was something wrong{\with you}, so I came back.
It's just a minor medical issue.
Aids?
No, I'm safe.
Blindness?
Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee?
I have a hernia.
- Do you have syphilis?
- I said it's a hernia.
I know.
It's possible to have two things.
Do you need a ride to the hospital?
Yes, please.
But I rode my bike{\ here}, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon.
Thank you.
- You still here?
- I wanted to see if you could tell.
Are you still here?
It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Man, oh, man.
So how's Ann?
She's doing good?
I miss her so much, it's ridiculous.
- How's she doing?
- Doing good tonight.
She's out on a...
Ann is great.
And I bet she really misses you.
I'm gonna need more{\ of these} if I'm gonna stay up{\ tonight}.
- Is that candy?
- It's a necklace made out of candy.
- Want one?
- Oh, all right.
Great.
All I've had is fruits and vegetables... for weeks now.
Oh, my God.
You know there's a string in there.
Not in this one.
Instant sugar high.
Sugar high.
Sugar hit high.
Sugar high.
High.
Are you okay?
Sugar slam.
Maybe we should get you something more substantial{\ to eat}.
I'm in.
Bring me back two cheeseburgers and a green tea.
Come on.
You got to be kidding me.
So that was fun.
Yeah, it really was.
- Surprisingly fun.
- You know what,
I have been a perfect gentleman this evening.
In fact, watch this.
I would like you to now please invite me in for a nightcap.
- Not a chance.
- No.
Just watch... watch what I'm gonna do.
Ask me in for a nightcap.
- Will you come in for a nightcap?
- Yes, I will.
No, no, damn.
Drats, I was gonna plan to not.
Wait.
Look.
That guy's trying to break into that van.
{\You know what, }It does look like he's breaking into that van.
- 911.
- Hi, there.
So, do you like spy on Ann?
From the pit?
I just like being nearby.
That way if she wants me back,
I could be at her house{\, like,} in two seconds, before she changes her mind.
I don't really know how healthy that is.
{\I mean, }You {\guys }aren't even dating anymore.
She might be dating somebody else.
- Is she?
- What?
- Is she dating somebody else?
- What?
- {\You just said Ann might be}She's dating somebody else{\.
Is she}?
- I didn't say that.
- Who is she dating?
- Nobody.
Mark.
It's cool.
My God!
{\pos(210,265)}641 to base *style.
I'm at the vehicle now.
How are you doing tonight{\, sir}?
I'm all right, officer.
How are you?
I'm responding to a 911 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
I need you to step out and show me some i.d.
It's okay, my name's Tom Haverford.
I work for the Parks Department.
I got locked out of the van.
I had to jimmy my way back in.
Why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some I.d.?
I just told you my i.d., so what's the crime here?
Parking while Indian?
There's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles.
All right, fine.
Here's my I.d.
Nice job, Paul Blart.
Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into{\ lady foot} locker?
I'm very close{\ right now} to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
{\pos(220,265)}
- Step out of the van.
- I'll step out of your mama's van.
{\pos(220,265)}{\
- What's wrong?
- }I didn't do anything!
I'm a city employee{\, man}.
- Come on!
- Calm down.
Motion sensors.
My God.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Cops took him.
What?
- My God.
- Ann and Mark!
It's Ann and Mark.
We caught a criminal.
Do you know about this?
He was breaking into this van, and they dragged him away.
It was crazy.
Right here.
What are you doing here?
If you could {\just } stop writing for a second and {\just }focus here, 'cause...
Ma'am.
As I've already told you {\several times }, this is a police matter.
It doesn't seem to matter to the police.
{\pos(192,240)}
- Nice job with that, but listen...
- Let me ask you a question.
{\pos(192,240)}Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department
{\pos(192,240)}to arrest people when they{\ try to} get into their own van?
{\pos(192,240)}{\And, thankfully,}That's not what happened.
{\pos(192,240)}{\So now }Could you please go home,
{\pos(192,250)}get some sleep and let this matter be resolved?
{\Thank you, officer.}Let's just go home.
Let's go home.
- No!
- Let's just go home.
Easy.
- Come with me{\, please}.
- {\Fine, }I'd like to come with you.
Your friend, he acted like an ass.
And{\ you got to believe me,} he didn't give me a choice.
Your name's Dave{\, right}?
Can I call you Dave?
My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on...
I hate to break it to you.
You really stepped in it.
What?
I'm a government employee, and so is your prisoner.
If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here.
Kicking down your doors.
That's right, you heard me.
What branch of government are you in?
Parks and Recreation.
Do I stutter?
It wasn't just his behavior.
I think your friend might be {\some kind of }a pervert.
{ o, look, }That's what people think when they first meet him
- but he's all talk.
- I'm being serious.
We searched the van, and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date.
We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy.
Tom and I were in that van together.
We were staking out the community garden because somebody planted marijuana in it.
I brought the candy, {\and I brought }a lot of it because I love it.
I took the pictures.
My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
It's been a very long night.
But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail.
Well, they're gonna release him.
In a little while.
Thank God.
Should I get you home right now?
{\You knowwhat, }You two go ahead.
I'm gonna stay here and wait for Tom.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Prison changes a man.
I think he'll wanna see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Well, OK, then.
See you, Leslie.
Yo.
I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
You ready?
I was born ready.
I'm Ron ***** Swanson.
Easy.
Care...
Careful!
Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in.
Terrible things happened last time.
So I guess I'll just... see you tomorrow.
Bye.
You kind of kissed me.
Yes, I did, and now we both have herpes.
I'll see you later.
- Thanks for waiting.
Appreciate it.
- Mother Teresa.
It's not your chocolate.
Don't... get your hands off that.
- Wake up.
- What?
Is this your house?
Where are we?
You're awake?
- Thanks for the coat.
- It's no problem, you can keep it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I need that for my uniform.
But I can give you a ride{\back to your car}.
We'll talk about the coat.
- I can't give it to you. {\You }Understand?
- OK.
So where's that marijuana at?
It's down in the garden.
Good meeting you, man.
Should grab a drink {\or something}some time.
I hope Ann and Mark got home okay.
That's all that matters{\, you know}.
That Ann is home, and she's okay.
And that Mark is also okay, and he is in his home.
Just important that they're both in their homes.
Mark's an idiot.
You could do a lot better than him.
Forget about him.
Thanks, Tom.
I didn't mean me.
Keep it in your pants, Knope.
I swear to God, it actually... it was there.
These are... carrots.
You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Is that the house there where your best friend lives?
Where she saw the van from?
I get it.
What?
You wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date.
I did not.
- There actually was weed here.
- It's okay.
I think it's kind of cute.
I like Miss Knope.{\I liked her.}
I gotta say when I first met her, I didn't care much for her, because, like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable.
Miss Knope was attractive to me as a man.
I was attracted to her in her demeanor.
I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
{\Can we... }I don't want to talk about this anymore.
What a crazy night.
Partner?
Want to go get some breakfast?
What?
No.
Take me home.
What is wrong with you?
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on!
I wonder if mini golf is open.
Home!
Ann-danawicz, what are you guys doing?
Eating?
Love it.
Just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night.
That was cool.
Peace.
We didn't think you were a pervert.
We thought you were a criminal.
For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert.

quick question:
Have you lost your mind?
shouldn't you be in class, Rhodey?
this isn't funny.
Daniels went nuts.
You're gonna get kicked out of school if you keep this up.
whatever you say, mom.
you're seriously losing it, Tony.
Between Iron Man, Stane, those rings in school,
You're dropping the ball.
I've heard this all before.
And you know what?
Fine.
If something's got to give, then let it be school.
I don't need it.
and what about me and Pepper?
Do you still need your friends?
I've got to go.
I'll call you back later.
Thud!
Iron Man.
is anyone hurt?
What happened?
uh, just a guy,
Some weird suit.
But he kept disappearing, then reappearing.
Then he burned a hole through the vault door.
I didn't even see him do it.
disappeared?
Where is he now?
Iron Man.
If you knew what was good for you,
You'd start running.
neat trick.
Where'd you get that suit?
jealous?
were you aware that you're leaking energy?
That's usually not very good for you.
Surrender now, and I'll make sure you get medical help.
no, I don't think I'll be surrendering.
Whap!
impressed?
I guess.
I'm the living laser now, Iron Man,
And I'm unstoppable.
The next time this laser fires,
It's going to be right--
you have the ability to turn yourself into a laser,
And the best you can come up with is robbing a bank?
That's sad.
oh.
this...
This is...
Oh, no.
Boom!
Come on, hurry up.
Come on!
so you ready to rehearse for drama class?
no.
I'm hacking into stark international's
Research databases.
wow, that sounds really fun and all,
But this is 1/3 of our grade, 1/3.
If we don't do this, we're gonna flunk, seriously.
the guy at the bank today, he had this.
It's a prototype for a laser teleportation device
Designed to convert matter to energy and back again.
My dad made it.
Your dad made stuff for super villains?
no, he had a room, a vault.
It's where he kept inventions that he hadn't finished,
Got bored with, and never perfected.
This was one of them.
It had design flaws that made it unstable.
I'd forgotten all about the vault.
But only one person could've gotten access to it.
Stane.
I have to get into stark international,
Find out what happened.
If this guy had tech from the vault,
Who knows what else is out there?
uh, Tony,
The school called my mom at work.
She wants to see you.
sit down, Tony.
We need to talk.
I already know what you're gonna say, mrs.
Rhodes.
"school is important.
Bring up your grades.
This is what my dad wanted."
But I just can't do it anymore.
Obadiah Stane is destroying my dad's company.
I have to focus on that.
In two years, I'll take over and--
Tony, you need to hear this,
But not from me.
dad?
it's a hologram.
Why do you have...
Tony, I wasn't just your dad's friend.
I was his lawyer and the executor of his will.
I don't understand.
I can't imagine how hard it was
To lose the only family you have.
I've tried to give you space, to respect your privacy.
But it can't go on like this.
what do you mean?
this is your father's will, Tony.
if you're seeing this, I'm gone,
And I'm truly sorry for that.
But you won't be alone, Tony.
You'll be living with david and roberta from now on.
And you'll go to school with Rhodey
At the tomorrow academy.
I've taught you, raised you, all on my own.
And maybe it wasn't the best choice for you,
But after losing your mother, I just wanted you close by me.
dad.
but now, if I'm gone,
If I can't be there to guide you...
Tony, too much money and power can be overwhelming for anyone,
Even someone as special and gifted as you.
I can't let you go down the wrong path.
And if you're gonna take over stark international,
You'll have hundreds of employees' lives in your hands.
The company is about more than science and tech.
It's about people.
I don't understand.
you have to learn to have a normal life, Tony,
With balance.
You need to have friends, to go to school,
To learn all the things I couldn't teach you.
But I don't want stark international
To be a burden to you.
Roberta, I know you're with Tony now.
He'll never have to worry about money.
But if you see he's struggling or overwhelmed
Or he can't maintain an acceptable grade point average,
If he can't,
Then control of stark international
Should be handed over to the company board.
I didn't show you this before
Because you were having a tough time.
It was too much.
But I never thought it would come to this.
Do you understand now, Tony?
You have to do well in school.
You have to keep your grades up.
Everything you care about depends on it.
guards.
Guards!
I'm burning up in here!
knock it off, parks!
Some of us are trying to sleep here!
oh, no.
Oh, no.
Somebody help.
it's not fair!
There's no way my father could've known
That Stane would turn his company evil,
That all his tech would end up on the streets,
That his life's work would be used to hurt people.
He couldn't have known that I'd be the only one
Who would stop it.
Tony, we'll get through this.
And you know, maybe this isn't the worst thing in the world.
what's that supposed to mean?
nothing.
Just that you've been pushing yourself too hard
And neglecting things like-- you know what happens when I don't push myself?
Lives are on the line.
And if I'm not there, people die.
If you can't understand that,
Then leave me alone.
Tony, come on.
You can't take that kind of responsibility.
All Rhodey meant was-- get out!
I was doing all of this for you, dad.
Tony's not answering my calls.
Did you see him this morning?
uh-uh.
He was gone when I woke up.
oh, man.
Do you think he ran away?
I'm not that smart.
you're okay.
Oh.
Uh, more or less.
Kind of stinky.
Did you lose your toothbrush?
I...
Guys, I'm sorry.
I was such a jerk last night.
This is what my dad wanted for me.
This is what I have to do to keep the company.
I've got to try no matter how bad things get.
whoo, you do kind of stink.
so you're really gonna stay,
And I'm not gonna flunk drama?
right, drama.
The test.
What...
What's the play again?
Hamlet?
What's that about?
ooh, it's about a prince
Who's pulled in a million directions
While trying to avenge his dead father.
No, seriously, what's it about?
Are you kidding me?
now, who can tell me what method acting is?
psst, Tony, your turn.
uh, line?
to be... that's just sad, stark.
you guys stink.
Uh, maybe we should do another part.
my honored lord, you know right well you did.
And with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich.
Their perfume lost, take these again,
For to the noble mind,
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
ah-ha, are you honest?
my lord.
are you fair?
what means, your lordship?
that is you be honest and fair,
Your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.
oh, okay.
Works for me.
I can memorize thousands of lines of computer code
And armor schematics.
Why can't I do this?
relax.
You still got time before the performance.
We'll go through it until you've got it.
Doesn't even have to be good.
You just have to say the lines.
doesn't have to be good?
I'm gonna be a laughing stock.
She rented a theater, Rhodey.
She's bringing in the whole school as an audience.
And isn't kind of evil to schedule a test at night?
wow, he's in a rush.
Something must be...
Going on.
Something big.
I want Iron Man here, and I want him now.
Do you hear me out there, Iron Man?
And if Iron Man doesn't show,
Then I'll turn this entire city into a pile of smoking ash.
open fire!
Gladly.
the living laser, the guy from the bank job.
The energy leak, it must've changed him somehow.
I have to do something.
The police, they'll be hurt or worse.
Tony.
but I've got the test.
If I miss it, if I fail,
I'll lose stark international.
Rhodey, what am I supposed to do?
you fight.
You save lives.
But you don't have to do it by yourself.
Right now, this city needs Iron Man.
So you go kick this guy's tail.
Get to the theater on time,
And Pepper and I will find a way to deal with school.
Don't worry, man.
We'll make this work...
Together.
thanks.
I owe you one, Rhodey.
yeah, hit me back by staying alive.
Now go, and don't be late.
oh, no.
He's not coming, is he?
I'm gonna fail.
What happened?
super villain, times square.
It's bad.
well, that's really inconvenient.
Stupid super villains.
The drama test is in like 40 minutes.
then we've got 39 minutes to figure out a plan.
you are about to get a very, very bad sunburn.
laser, get away from him.
Whoosh!
it's okay.
I only want you.
I wanted to thank you.
See, when we met, you said something to me.
Do you remember?
You said that for a guy who could turn into a laser,
Robbing banks was dumb.
And you were right.
So I've come up with something better.
yeah, what's that?
I'm gonna be the man who fried Iron Man.
Is that the best you can do?
Sad.
ah!
Boom!
Uh.
Listen to me.
You need help.
The energy from the equipment you were using has changed you.
It could be fatal.
like I care.
All my life, I've been a nobody.
But now I'm somebody.
I'm the living laser.
Oh, you're somebody?
Oh, sorry.
That's funny coming from someone
Who doesn't even have a body now.
you're laughing at me.
I was wrong.
You don't need a doctor.
You need a therapist.
And you should've stuck to robbing banks.
that tickled.
ah!
Perfect.
all right, no more jokes.
You can't win, Iron Man.
You don't even know what power is.
I am power!
You can't even touch me, but I can touch you.
You think I can't get through that armor?
Watch me!
uh!
integrity at risk.
Shielding failure eminent.
Unable to compensate for energy frequency.
ah.
Frequency.
He can change his frequency.
That's why the repulsors didn't work.
His energy form is operating on a different wavelength.
Computer, alter the frequency of all weapon systems
To match the living laser, now.
analyzing.
Frequency matched.
you want power, laser?
Have some more!
how...
That's not possible.
I'm the living laser.
You can't touch me.
touch.
well, that was...
Hamlet!
well, good of you to join us, mr.
Stark.
You and miss potts may proceed.
I...
I can't remember anything.
I don't know the lines.
I can't.
it's okay.
Just relax.
yet here, laertes,
Aboard, aboard for shame.
those friends thou hast,
And their adoption tried.
Grappled them unto thy soul
With hoops of steel.
Whoo, thanks, guys.
That's not in the play, mr.
Stark.
Sorry.
This above all, to thine own self be true.
sync: f1nc0 thx to Adriano_CSI
Hey, Lemar, what's up?
You owe me 10 bucks!
Sorry, guys.
Sorry about that.
So then you're gonna walk through it going...
Good morning, Ithaca!
Hey, Lisa, you were supposed to call me!
Call me tonight, all right?
God!
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
You cut off his leg!
Somebody get some help!
I need a tourniquet and some ice.
Okay, don't panic.
Don't panic.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm a trained first responder, okay?
- Can you hear me?
- I am so fired.
Is he laughing?
- Y'all got punk'd!
- What?
Son of a bitch.
Works every time, yo.
Thanks, man.
Welcome to the University of Ithaca.
I'm Kyle, your PUSE.
Come on, pervs.
PUSE.
It stands for Prospective Undergraduate Student Envoy.
Come on, people.
Lighten up, it was a joke.
He's fine.
- Take it easy, man.
- You owe me a beer.
See?
We're all about special needs here.
As a matter of fact, our motto is, "If you're special, we needs you. "
So, besides being a PUSE, what do you do at Ithaca, Kyle?
Well, I've been an RA for four years.
I'm currently getting my Ph. D., and I'm the alumni advisor for my frat.
Wow.
Yeah.
What percentage of Ithaca students end up going to Ivy League grad schools?
That's a good question, and I'm not really sure.
Okay, well, am I going to be limited in the number of hours that I can take in a semester, or...
I don't know, but if not, you sure should be.
Can I be both a double major and a double minor?
I really don't know about that, either.
So, what do you know, Mr. PUSE?
That Ithaca is the proud holder of a national athletic championship.
Yeah, no way.
No, this is an academic institution.
I mean, your mascot's a librarian.
- Lydia, stop.
- What?
He's a moron.
I'm sorry.
She's under a lot of stress right now.
It's okay.
- Mom, you're doing it again.
- What?
Doing what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Ryan told me what you did during his campus visit.
- I have no idea what she's talking about.
- Oh, my God.
- You get back here right now, missy!
- Or what?
No, it's cool, she can leave.
Of course, you're gonna be missing out on a really great story.
Love.
- Sex.
- Oh, God.
The relentless pursuit of academic excellence.
Fine.
Okay, so, there's this guy named Andy who lives on my floor, right?
And he's been dating this girl named Katy for, like, ever.
They began as high school lab partners in Mr. Blankenbaker's biology class.
Andy helped Katy win the science fair, and Katy became Andy's band manager and biggest fan.
They were in love, whatever that is, and they promised that graduation would only make them stronger.
Though their bodies were separated, their hearts stayed together tight, till the start of their junior year.
After five years of love
This song's just not enough
So I decided I won't be denied and I'll sing it in the buff
In the buff, in the buff
Girl, it ain't so tough
In the buff, in the buff
Girl, it ain't so tough to sing it in the buff
In the buff
Dude!
What the fuck?
Korky, a little help.
My toe's cramping up.
I don't care if you're having fucking seizures.
- That is horrible.
- Korky.
- Did you ever hear of manscaping?
- I need help.
Don't touch me.
I'll be outside.
- Do you actually have testicles?
- Didn't you just see them?
I'm serious, man.
My cousin, his never dropped.
He literally has no balls.
So when he tells me that he can't break up with his girlfriend, I get that.
No, it's not that I can't, Korkin.
I don't want to.
I mean, Katy's beautiful.
She's smart.
She's...
Got your balls locked in her Hello Kitty hope chest?
Wait, wait, wait.
What is that shit?
- This, my friend, is known as an ILMAG.
- A what?
An Improvised Last-Minute Anniversary Gift.
Every year I have a reminder set on my computer, but this year, mysteriously, it didn't go off.
You're welcome.
Dude!
Uncool.
Sabotage was my last resort.
You're 21 and you act 40.
- You never go out.
You never party.
- I play beer pong every weekend.
And you go right home after every tournament.
- Know why?
- Why?
Because you fear temptation.
And who fears temptation but a man with doubts?
- Work it, Chloe.
- Bite it, Korkin.
Okay, okay, so sometimes I'm tempted.
But overall, I'm a very happy man, okay?
Let me make you happier.
Designate Katy as your back-home girl.
Your hometown honey.
She's there for weekends, vacations, long dry spells.
Let her think whatever she wants, but here, you do whatever you want.
It's a win-win.
- Okay, unlike you, I don't cheat.
- What does that even mean?
It means I don't cheat.
In that bucket is concentrated urine and feces.
Any Hagan Hall man known to have a steady girlfriend gets treed.
Ass Turd will be there till she comes to rescue him.
Guess I better not mention K
- A-T-Y to these guys.
Korkin, no.
You don't want to know what else they put in that bucket.
You know, maybe you could have mentioned that before I swapped dorms.
- Please don't swap dorms.
- Katy?
It took me forever to find this one.
- What are you doing here?
- Hi!
Your big tournament's tonight, so I wanted to say happy anniversary and cheer you on in person.
That is so cool.
- I'm not done.
Guess what else?
- What could be better?
I transferred here, to Ithaca!
- Wow!
- Wow!
Better update those hepatitis shots, bro.
There's a storm brewing, boys.
Wind, four knots.
Barometric pressure, falling.
Perfect conditions for Hurricane Jake.
Ponage!
Only his third try, Raz-R.
See you at Nationals.
Eat pussy.
You suck.
As soon as I capture this tape, I can upload it to YouTube.
What about your full ride at CMU?
I mean, it's like the Harvard of horticulture.
Yeah, it's amazing, but so are you.
I mean, we only have one chance to be in college together.
I don't want to waste it.
Didn't you feel like we were slipping away with all the e-mails and Skype sex?
I don't know.
Maybe.
- I freaked you out, didn't I?
- No!
I mean, no, I...
It's gonna be great.
Girl, it ain't so tough...
Okay.
...to sing it in the buff
In the buff
There's a storm brewing, boys.
Wind, four knots.
Barometric pressure, falling.
Perfect conditions for Hurricane Jake.
- Somebody looks freaked out.
- I'm not freaked out.
Well, you should be.
She's gonna suck you into some off-campus apartment with curtains and coasters and a chaise lounger with those giant fucking pillows.
Kick her ass to the curb before you get doused with concentrated urine and feces.
No woman is worth that.
But right now, both you douche bags need to focus.
We go to war in one hour.
Awesome.
- New uniforms.
- Are you ready to protect this house?
Sexy.
Go away.
Unless you have breasts.
- Hey, guys.
What's up?
- Kyle!
The man!
Dude, you're back!
Yeah, I went to Prague in May on a convention that ended up on a three-month pub crawl where I got laid a lot.
- Very nice.
- By different girls.
Wow.
That's real diversity, Kyle.
- Wait, is the tournament tonight?
- The finals.
You coming?
No, I can't.
I've got a frat meeting.
We're practicing for our new step show.
- What?
- Nice!
Yeah, well, it's better with, like, more black guys, but there's a little taste.
Well, I'm bummed I'm gonna miss tonight.
Well, give them hell for Hagan Hall.
You, too, Kyle.
Give them hell, bro.
Glad you're back, man.
- Take it easy, guys.
- Peace.
Peace.
Shit.
It's ready.
Shit.
Raz-R beat us to it.
What?
That's the third trick shot he's uploaded this week.
What up, Jake the Fake?
Just wanted to say good luck tonight, so I can kick your bony ass in Atlanta.
That's right, baby.
Do not let him into your head.
He's already there.
God.
See, there was a time eons ago when beer pong was simply a fringe novelty game played by Cro-Magnons in cave-like garages using paddles.
But the sport, thank you very much, has now evolved into a grueling mano a mano death match designed to push mind, body and liver to their furthest limits.
Thus the high-tech athletic gear.
Exactly, me lady.
Our bodies are our weapons.
Jake is one of the best trick-shotters in the country.
This right here is like our Olympic trials.
- Hello!
- Well, Godspeed, good sirs, and may you vanquish your many enemies.
- God, that's so lame.
- Korkin.
- Right, here you go.
- Thank you.
There's something I forgot to tell you about this place.
- What?
- When somebody puts money in the jar...
It's titty time!
...they flash you.
Welcome to the show, honey.
No, I'm not done yet.
Welcome to the University of Ithaca's Beer Pong Finals, where tonight one of these eight teams will win full sponsorship from Ta Ta's Pub to compete for the National Collegiate Championship!
This is it!
Let's pong it out, bitches!
It's titty time!
- We go eye to eye for possession.
- Okay.
Splash!
We get the balls back for two-hit shots, but we get to keep shooting until one of us misses.
- I'm so glad I'm here.
- I'm not glad you're here.
Hey, buddy, listen.
You shoot.
I'll talk.
Katy, hi.
Girlfriends and beer pong don't mix.
Unless, of course, you can do that.
Nope.
Can't do that.
All right, Ithaca's boys are going to Atlanta next week.
Bounce shots can be blocked, and guys can finger the rim when it's a spinner, but not girls.
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
Yeah!
Girls can blow the hole and it scores as our miss.
Damn it.
Son of a...
Kiki, a drink for our opponents.
I remember.
Now, go do your thing.
She's just a distraction.
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Hey, Lester.
Now check this out.
Andy, you the man!
That's our secret phrase.
Hit a cup in our opponent's hand, and it's...
Death cup.
Game over, asshole.
Yes!
Yes, man!
Yes!
All right, all right, all right!
Who's going to the A-town next week?
Lock and load.
It's titty time!
All right, Ithacans!
This is it, the finals!
We trick-shot for possession.
Come on, Jake.
Did you see that?
Did you see that?
Possession, Hagan Hall!
Hagan!
Hagan!
Hagan!
Hagan Hall.
So do I get to wear your beer pong letterman jacket, you jock stud?
Actually, it wasn't my best night.
Maybe I can change that.
- It's time to celebrate our anniversary.
- How?
See you in an hour.
What's up, guys?
Dude, this is what awaits us at the end of the rainbow, my friend,
- if you get your fucking head straight.
- No way.
- What?
- I knew her before I met Katy.
Her name's Jenna.
She's French.
Bullshit.
So, before Katy, there was Jenna.
She was a total babe.
Sexy.
Exotic.
A real woman among boys, not unlike the lovely lady by my side.
Did I trip you?
I'm sorry.
Such soft, gentle hands.
So, what's your degree in?
- Interpretive Urban Dance.
- It is so hot.
Yeah, so, I'm sorry, you were saying, about the young, hot, exotic Jenna?
Yeah.
Way back before there was ever a Katy,
Jenna was Andy's first crush, his first kiss, and would have even been his first boink, if not for the vicious, man-eating corn snake who called their love nest home.
Jenna's foot recovered nicely with donated replacement tendons from a cadaver.
But once she was loaded into the ambulance,
Andy never heard from her again.
- Bullshit.
- No, I'm serious.
We met at summer camp when I was 16.
- She gave me this bracelet.
- Bullshit.
To prove the lovely Jenna was once his willing near-boink,
Andy logged on to the Pong America web site in an effort to find her.
And Jenna nearly wet her dainty little panties when Andy pinged her, which gave him a virtual hard-on.
She gave me her digits.
Call her.
- I'm going to.
- Okay.
Of course I remember mon Andrew!
Of course she remembers mon Andrew.
I have wondered about you many times.
- She's wondered about me many times.
- Wondered if you're straight?
We actually won our beer pong tournament.
I'm coming to Atlanta next week!
No!
First you must come meet me on the tour!
You can hang out with me and the other girls on the bus!
- Do you wanna go?
No?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Okay.
Where are you?
- Tomorrow we are in Illinois.
- I'll meet you in Illinois.
- Where the hell is Illinois?
He's coming to see me.
- Wait.
I can't leave.
- What?
What?
I can't go anywhere.
Katy just transferred here.
Give me her.
Dude, this chick is a world-class hottie, and some snake stole your chance to consummate?
You have to go to her.
Now.
It's a rite of passage, a vision quest.
Vision.
- I can't.
- Okay.
Tell me this.
Is Katy just your first, your first of many, or your first and last?
How should I know?
Then let's go find this goddess, and then if you realize you still want Katy, you'll never have to worry about having doubts again.
You'll know she's the one.
- That was the best week of my life.
- Until now.
- Road trip!
- Road trip!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
The bar gave us tickets to Atlanta.
Who's paying for us to get to Illinois?
We need some chump to sponsor us.
I know a guy.
- Whoa!
- What the hell, Andy?
Really nice.
I'd give you like a five, Katy, maybe six.
- Okay, serious...
- Okay, Korkin, that's good.
Why are they outside my door?
We have to go meet another sponsor.
- Now?
- Yeah, I know, but...
But it's our anniversary.
Look, I'll be right back, okay?
And then we'll have all night to celebrate.
- Okay.
- In the buff.
And I wrote a new song for you.
Out.
Now.
That's embarrassing.
- Now!
Right now!
- Korkin.
Jake.
- Bye.
- "I wrote a song for you. "
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
His name is Arash.
His dad's the dictator of Tandoor.
- Where the hell is Tandoor?
- Next to Illinois.
No, it's an island off the coast of Indonesia.
He's loaded.
I took Intro to Modern Drug Cultures with him.
Awesome class.
Changed my life.
- Yes?
- Hey, man.
It's Jake.
I brought some weed.
I'm winning this.
This is the game...
This is the game of real life.
This is not a fantasy.
Welcome to real life.
I hope you like...
I bet you guys kick ass at paintball.
I have the weed.
I don't know...
You're dying.
You're not living anymore.
This is the real life.
Do not fuck with me, Lawdawg54!
I am now owning your ass!
I am the property master and you are my servant!
Yes.
In your face!
That hurts bad.
Go to sleep!
I admired your essay on the socio-political relevance
- of Up in Smoke very much, Jake.
- Thanks, man.
So, tell me, why are you really here?
My friend and I are beer pong players, and we come requesting sponsorship for our team.
- Beer pong?
- Let me demonstrate.
I have seen this.
You Americans can turn even drinking into a contest.
Indeed.
But if we win, your investment will be doubled, and you will bring glory to your father, your country and to Ithaca.
- I will travel with you?
- Probably better if we go it alone.
Keep costs down.
Stay low profile.
I have no need for money, I hate my father, my country is a shit bucket, and Ithaca was my fallback.
Evidently, Harvard does not accept the sons of despots.
Who knew?
Leave me now.
I will keep your hashish in return for my time.
Wait!
You can come, and I'll put us on a busload of gorgeous models.
Look, this girl in the middle, that's the girl I'm going to see.
- Is she a virgin?
- She's all natural, man.
- Except for some tendons in her foot.
- And her private regions?
Jungle bush?
Okay.
If you are lying, you will all be kidnapped and sent to my father's mines, where you will work in complete darkness until you die of the black lung,
filthy, emaciated and cold.
- Works for me.
- No problem.
Yes.
- Then we have a deal.
Yes.
- Yes.
- Here we go.
Okay.
Very good.
- Thank you.
Phone the hanger.
Have them prepare Tandoor 2 for a dawn departure.
And make me some soup.
- What is Tandoor 2?
- It's the royal jet.
Fuck yeah, it is!
Welcome to the team!
Fuck yeah, it is!
- Hey, what's this?
- Not good.
- Shit.
- Adji!
This is the CIA.
You're surrounded, and we're coming in.
It's him.
He's the terrorist!
Andy, where are you?
It's been, like, three hours.
Please call me back.
Your turn, Jenna.
And no dares for you.
I want the truth.
- Was this Andy guy your first?
- I'm working.
- Yeah, we wanna hear the truth, sister.
- Come on, Jenna.
Fine, the answer is no, but almost.
Within one week we were in love.
- So, you guys gonna hook up or what?
- I don't hook up.
I'm a lady.
- Who sells beer with her breasts.
- Right.
And then, overwhelmed by the inter-gravitational pull of their mutual hotness, the beer pong girls engaged in a naked pillow fight.
What a bunch of male wish-fulfillment bullshit.
I've never been in a naked pillow fight before.
I have.
Right.
So anyway, our heroes were transported to a secret CIA interrogation center, where they were interrogated...
No.
No.
That looks like Korkin's mom.
- ... tortured...
- This is a bad trip.
I'm tripping out, man!
- Hey, man.
- ... and humiliated.
- You don't need to do it.
- Open wide for mommy!
What the fuck is that?
No, no, no, no, no.
Back up.
Back up.
Turns out papa tyrant was overthrown in a coup.
All of his assets were seized and given to the poor, hungry people of Tandoor.
Greedy bastards.
I thought my dad was bad, but apparently some despotic parents can never be pleased.
Okay, it's safe.
My dick hole is the size of a garden hose, you son of a bitch!
So sorry.
Okay, okay, all right.
Allow me to apologize to you all.
I had no idea my father would be overthrown by a group of 12 unarmed peasants and a wizard.
I am now destitute, penniless, homeless.
- Welcome to America.
- Korkin, it's not his fault.
We're lucky they let us go.
Let's just find out where we are.
"Bethesda"?
- That's bullshit, man.
- Maryland?
It's like, there should be a fucking law that the fucking CIA has to fucking drop you off where they fucking got you!
- So write your fucking congressman!
- You know what?
Eat my ass, Korkin, 'cause I had to swallow a whole pound of weed, and then they made me listen to techno all night.
You know what that's like?
Guys!
Okay, you know what?
Shut up and let's focus on getting out of here.
Oh, shit.
- Hello?
- Andy, where are you?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
You won't believe what happened.
Thank you.
Jake, follow me.
Ass-rash, thanks for nothing, and I'll see you never.
No, no, no, no, wait, wait, you can't leave me here.
His dad is the dictator of Tandoor, right?
The dictator of Tandoor?
If I am found by rebel agents, I will be brutally tortured and fed to goats.
That's not my problem, shithead.
We need a sponsor, not some assassination target.
For the first time in my life, I have no guards, no father.
- I am finally free.
- All right, I have an idea.
- Please don't leave me here, Korkin.
- Play along, or you're goat food.
- Take that.
- Okay.
Follow me.
He was going to fly us to Atlanta on Tandoor 2, his own private jet.
You want me to believe that you stood me up on our anniversary so you could ride on some dictator's airplane?
My phone's dying, Ass-rash, so hurry up.
Take some bags, head to the van in the front.
Do you see keys?
- Yes.
- Okay, put the luggage in the back.
Wait!
Turn right.
The cabbies are staring at you.
Flip them off.
No, flip them off!
Flip them off!
No, not me, moron.
Them.
Do it!
My uncle was a cabbie!
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off!
They had helicopters and they had laser-sight guns, and then we were thrown into this helicopter...
- Hit it!
- Hit what?
- Go!
- What, drive?
- Awesome!
- You can't drive?
I was never allowed to, but I am most excellent at Super Mario Kart.
Korkin had, like, this penile pap smear, Jake was tortured by bad music.
And let me guess, you were waterboarded?
No, that was Arash.
Need a ride?
Get in!
- No!
No, no, no, you didn't.
- Come on!
- Okie dokie.
- Come on.
Like that.
It was totally crazy.
Okay.
So, how does this ridiculous farce contribute to my decision to come here?
Because it speaks to the spirit of our students.
I became the man I am today because of a road trip.
- I love a good ride.
- Mom.
- I still like to roll every once in a while.
- Mom!
Okay.
TMI.
Come in.
- Katy Hartman?
- Yeah.
- Andy's Katy?
- Yeah.
Cool.
I'm Kyle, your RA.
You know, Andy and I are pretty good friends.
We even compared penises in the shower once, and he totally regretted it.
So this is Amy.
Amy had a little altercation with her former Sigma Gamma roommate and had to be relocated.
I think you guys are gonna be a good match.
Hey!
How's my favorite glamorous supermodel?
Very glamorous, mon amour.
Runway.
Bright lights.
Wait, I send you a photo.
- Mandee?
- Okay.
Smile!
That looks like a fun job.
Good resume builder.
Okay.
So wait.
So you transferred from your dream school, the Columbia of cultivation, to be here for some guy?
I missed him, and I wanted to be with him.
And now there's a nail in that man's head because he bounced the same day you showed up?
We'll get through it, and I'll just stay busy until he gets back.
What?
Baking cookies?
Doing his ironing?
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying.
Look here, Amy,
I don't care how many sorority girls you've punched.
Just because I don't have purple eye shadow and spiky hair doesn't mean I'm not a strong, independent woman, okay?
I just panicked, all right?
And now I'm here and he's there, and, frankly, I'm a little freaked out.
Okay.
Look, I'm having a party tonight, all right?
Just some ladies hanging out, having a good time.
I think you should come.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Do you remember the song you wrote for me?
When the bitches attack Don't you cry, don't you cry
Because, baby, Big A's got your back
Big A's got your back
God.
- Wow, I kind of forgot that one.
- But you still have a record deal, no?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sure.
I just recorded a new song yesterday, actually.
- In my studio.
- What?
Yeah, sure he did.
We have a stage on the tour.
You can play a concert when you arrive.
Actually, we got a little sidetracked, so we won't be able to make it today, but I'll meet you at your next stop in Nashville for sure.
I must now enter the glamorous beer pong dunking booth.
Au revoir, my wittle French fry.
- I'm gonna fucking puke.
- I, too, am in need of a restroom.
- Again?
- What are you, a chick?
Nudie bar!
Pull in there.
You can potty while we party.
My people are known to have diminutive bladders.
To go with your diminutive wittle weewees?
Is that your record studio, Big A?
Gotta go.
Gotta go.
Gotta go.
- Hey.
- Andy!
Boys, give it up for Bambi!
Bambi enjoys early bird specials, cuddling up with a nice box of wine, and watching reruns of Matlock!
- Shit.
Left my wallet in the car.
- Yeah, me, too.
Welcome to the Kit 'N Cougar, fellas.
Actually, we just came so my friend could take a piss.
So you wanna use my plumbing, but you can't patronize my business?
No, of course not.
Don't be rude, Jake.
Let's party.
After last night and then this morning I was totally freaking out, but my new roommate is so sweet.
She invited me to her party tonight, and I decided to go with her.
Good for you.
That's great.
Don't fight it, boys.
You'll never get her out of your mind.
You think our cougar's hot, you gotta see our kittens.
The kitten?
Show me a little pussy.
Watch your language, boy.
This is a classy establishment.
Yes, sir.
No problem, sir.
Arash, get the fuck over here.
I mean, I can't believe it!
This campus is really gorgeous.
And I found this cute little coffee shop where we can study by the fire together when it's snowing.
Dude, if one of the Golden Girls tries to give me a lap dance,
I swear to God, I am gonna puke.
Hi, guys.
You like the twins?
- They're sisters?
- Fraternal.
I'm their ma, and Bambi dancing out there, well, she's my ma.
And Lester, that teddy bear that brought you all in, well, he's my hubby.
It's a family business.
Then momma, come to daddy.
Mangoes.
There are these adorable little apartments off campus.
We can totally move in together next year.
I like you.
I have to go.
- Watch the hands, Mowgli.
- Okay.
There's even a spare room for my mom, when she comes to visit.
She'll totally cook and clean.
You know her!
I'll make us some curtains, and we can buy our own furniture.
I've always wanted one of those chaise loungers with the big, fluffy pillows.
- Katy?
Katy?
- This is going to be so great for us.
I thought you were mad at me.
Well, I was, until I read about the coup in Tandoor.
How's Arash?
Poor little guy.
Oh, my God.
That's disgusting!
Carrie, I told you that could happen.
Now be professional, sug.
Mom, he peed on me.
Lester, code red!
Golden shower in the champagne room!
- You have a napkin?
- He's fine.
We found a ride and we're headed to the tournament.
That's awesome.
Well, I have to jet to registration, but have fun, okay?
Love you.
Bye.
- Korkin!
- What?
He pissed on my baby girl!
- Get them!
- Oh, shit!
Get the fuck in the cab!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
They both had the same exact little mole above their butt cracks.
Never have I seen six more perfectly diverse breasts.
And now, thanks to Ass-rash and his girlie bladder, that memory will forever be a painful one, because my already swollen dick is now chaffed from sprinting full speed with a fucking boner!
- Yeah!
- Come on, man.
No hitchhikers.
Not a hitchhiker, a fare.
This is a taxi and we need some money.
Plus, do you see that ass?
Hi!
Need a ride?
You can share a fare with these guys.
Hi.
So where you heading?
- Just down the road.
- That's cool.
But I wouldn't go too far down the road in a stolen cab.
Not too hard to spot, you know.
Come on, guys.
DC plate, the meter's not running, and your cabbie's sitting in the back in girlie pink pajamas 'cause he pissed his pants.
- Interesting ensemble yourself.
- I know, right?
I got this off a Dr. Ratchett.
No way was I gonna run cross-country in high heels.
Shit!
My stomach, man.
What's his deal?
He swallowed a bag of marijuana before we were detained by the CIA.
I fucking hate those guys, man!
Seriously.
They have been spying on me ever since I got back.
- Back from where?
- I can't say.
They're listening.
God!
- Pull over, man.
It's bad.
- Right there.
I have to dump this load somewhere.
- Not in the car.
- Here's a convenience store.
- Convenient?
Do they sell trousers?
- Lf you had any money.
- Who wants grub?
- I do.
- I do.
- No.
No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
- My stomach is hollow.
It's hollow.
- No one cares.
- No, we're broke.
- No worries.
I'll buy.
Korkin, that woman clearly just escaped from somewhere not good.
That's why we get the food and then ditch her ass.
Go tell Jake the plan.
Let me handle this.
Okay?
Hey, hey.
Thanks, buddy.
Hey, you guys, grab a basket, get anything you want.
- Sweet.
- See you tomorrow.
Hey, Jake, it's me.
Let's go.
Korky's going to ditch her as soon as she buys us food.
Yeah, Andy.
Why don't I just lube my hands so I can shove it up my ass and remove the bag of ganja lodged in my rectum?
- Hey, handsome.
- Hey.
We're going to take all of this,
- and everything you got in the register.
- Hello!
Come on.
Come on.
- All right.
Don't shoot.
- Move.
- Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
- Stop pressuring me!
- Hurry up.
Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.
Come on.
Let's go.
Keys, please.
Come on, come on.
Thanks.
You guys might wanna hit the floor right about now.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay, then.
You bitches stay on the floor.
Your ho is gonna die.
Back door!
Hey, Jake, back door.
Come on!
Go, go, go, go!
- You okay?
- Shit.
- Thought you took care of that.
- Fucker never came out.
Pretty sure the baggie burst, though.
- No signal.
- Who are you calling?
I don't know, man. 911?
We need some help.
What are you gonna tell them?
Our stolen taxi got stolen?
- Wait, you have a better idea?
- No.
Not yet, but I'm not a quitter.
I'm finishing this thing.
Finishing what, Korkin?
You don't even play beer pong.
We're in deep shit here, man, and it's all your fault, so you better start praying we get out of this somehow.
You want me to pray?
You want me to pray?
Fine!
Here I am praying that Jake can squeeze a fucking pot brownie
- from his rectum.
- Please, God.
Here I am praying that Arash isn't devoured by goats.
Here I am praying that the aliens return Andy's balls, so he can be a man and dump his lame-ass girlfriend!
Here I am praying for a miraculous rescue before the cops take us all to jail!
Amen!
Is that good enough for you?
You guys okay?
Wow.
Wow.
No.
We're not, actually.
We're in big trouble.
Would you believe our van got stolen?
That sucks.
Were you just at the retreat?
Why, yes!
Yes, we were at the retreat.
We were retreating.
But now we're here, alone in the wilderness, all by ourselves.
Well, we could give you guys a ride to the next town, I guess.
That would be mighty kind.
We're headed to Nashville.
We're from Arkansas.
We go right through there.
Thank God you stopped.
Well, you see four guys praying by the side of the road, and you kind of feel obligated, you know?
Hello.
Is your friend okay?
I'm fine.
Much better now.
I can totally hear myself blink.
Think.
- So, do you guys wanna go to the cops?
- No.
- Yeah, that car sucked, anyway.
- Yeah, it's insured.
- So, what's next?
- Party, dumbass.
Jake's baggie burst.
He's stoned and happy.
Even Ass-rash here might get laid.
Nobody's getting laid.
Hate to tell you this, but this is a church retreat about chastity.
- What the hell is chastity?
- Abstinence from sexual intercourse.
What?
- Abstinence from sexual intercourse.
- No sex until marriage.
Well, that's fucking perfect.
I'm a devout heathen, you're gonna cheat on your girlfriend with a beer pong model, Jake's stoned out of his fucking gourd, and Ass-rash here is a Muslim.
- I am Hindu, asshole.
- Is there a difference?
And if you call me Ass-rash again, I will rip off your arm and I will bitchslap you with your own hand.
Just a joke, man.
No need to go all third world on me.
Wow, is that your van?
- Let go!
- Wow.
- No.
No.
- No.
- That one's a taxi.
- No.
- Ready?
Okay.
- Okay, you got this.
- I got this.
- All right.
- My name's Sarah.
- Korkin.
- What's your first name?
- People call me Korkin.
So, Sarah, have you ever been tempted to break the chastity code?
I sure have.
Well, Korkin, my father, people call him Reverend.
He founded the Chastity Movement.
So, does that answer your question?
Yeah.
Guess so.
Good.
Now I've got one for you.
What's the deal?
I saw you duck when we passed the cops.
Okay.
Okay.
I like you, so I'm gonna do something here that I never really do, ever,
- and tell the truth.
- You better, or you're going to be finding another ride.
We weren't at any retreat.
No.
Andy and Jake are actually beer pong players from the University of Ithaca, and technically I'm their manager, but really I just tag along to cause trouble.
We're trying to get to Atlanta for Nationals, but we've got to go through Nashville first so that Andy can hook up with a beer pong model.
And our stolen van...
I mean, our van was stolen by that chick after she robbed a store and got us shot at.
That's it.
So will you take us?
To Nashville or Atlanta?
Both?
Road trip?
- Road trip!
- Road trip!
- Yes!
- Yeah.
What?
Come on.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I just feel a little out of place.
Girl, please, chill out.
Here.
Have some fun.
I mean, these girls are all really, really close.
That's pretty close.
So what I didn't tell you is, we're all LUGs.
- You're what?
- Lesbians Until Graduation.
Okay.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now, but I'm pretty sure that I'm still straight.
Yeah, okay.
That's what I said my first time, too.
- Andrew.
- Hey, Jenna.
So, we're on the road.
Did you find another bus full of models to play with?
Yeah, but they only do cornhole tournaments.
You Americans and your corn.
Anyway, my friends, they start to think you are my fantasy.
- Well, I am, right?
Your fantasy?
- Of course, mon amour.
Since our last kiss that tragic day, you have been my one thought, my one breath, my one dream.
No pregnancy.
No VD, and let me just say, women know how to love other women.
That's the LUG life, baby.
Yeah, I bet the initiation ceremony is a whole lot of fun.
So, are you seeing anyone?
Other then drunk college boys with beer breath and bad hair?
No.
And you?
With your music career, you must meet many beautiful women.
Totally, all the time.
I mean, too many to choose from, really.
It's crazy.
How nice of you to fit me into your busy schedule, monsieur Casanova.
Well, we do have some unfinished business,
- if I recall correctly.
- Indeed we do.
Indeed we do.
I'm not saying you gotta LUG it out.
I mean, how long has it been since you haven't had a boyfriend?
- Since about the sixth grade.
- Girl, please.
How you supposed to be sure about this guy unless you look around?
And how do you know he's not doing the same damn thing while he's out on his mysterious little trip?
Thank you for using Auto Service System.
My name is Sujatmi.
How may I help you?
Sujatmi is a lovely name.
My name is Arash.
I'm from Tandoor.
Oh, my God!
- Sujatmi, I'm so lonely.
- Arash, that is so sad.
Sujatmi, I have not spoken with a Tandoori female in many, many a moon.
That is a long time, Arash.
Is this a dream?
Is this reality?
No, this is all a fantasy.
- Okay.
- Are you ready?
For fantasy?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Yes.
- What are you wearing?
- I'm wearing a very stylish shirt.
I'm also wearing some pajamas with squirrels, pink squirrels.
What are you wearing?
- A sari.
- A sari.
I bet it is a lovely sari.
What color is it?
Well, here I am, Arash.
Here I am.
Your voice is so lovely right now.
Are you hot?
Yes, I am so hot.
- Are you hot?
- I'm very, very hot.
So hot there is literally a fire in my pants.
How big is the fire?
I'd say three to four-alarmer.
It's a big one.
Why don't you blow it out?
- I can't.
I can't.
It's too big.
- Please.
- You have put a spell on my banana.
- Yes.
Is it peeling?
- It is peeling.
It is ripe.
- Yes.
Right now, you're so tight, I need to loosen you up.
- You caveman.
- I will take you and, with a club, beat you on the head and bring you to my cave.
- Hibernate in the winter.
- Yes, talk dirty.
Yes.
Yes.
- It's very dirty.
I do not wipe anything.
- Yes.
Yes.
- There's stuff everywhere.
- I will bathe you.
- You are the man.
- Do you like the loofah?
- I do.
- I will loofah your behind.
Smother you with lather.
I am playing with my banana.
If you were in a field right now, I would till it.
No one has tilled it before.
- No one has tilled you?
- No.
Maybe.
- I just want Tandoori boobiebs.
- That's me.
Arash, Arash, Sujatmi is here.
Sujatmi, I will take you home, I will put you on my bed...
- Oh, God.
... and then I will...
All over your place.
- Sujatmi.
- Arash.
- Sujatmi, touch it, touch it.
- Arash.
Touch it good.
Arash!
- I am playing the pied piper.
- Arash.
- Arash.
Arash.
- Peel the banana.
Do you like the baby gravy on your mashed potatoes?
What did you do?
It appears you have had an accident.
Arash, what was that?
Arash hit a wild boar during his telephone orgasm,
- and it got stuck under the bus.
- You killed it.
I just ejaculated.
Lick my balls.
But they decided to leave it there in case they got hungry.
Kind of like when you're fishing and you get hungry, so you decide to eat some worms.
What?
Fish eat them.
That's all very fascinating, Kyle, but I'd rather hear more about you.
No, not me.
In fact, my heart is racing.
I want to hear the end.
Please?
So, our group was back on the move.
- All right, Arash.
- You're coming?
- I'm up.
- Okay.
Done.
- I've got the gas.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
- All right, grab it.
- Okay, cool.
- Okay, go under my arm.
Okay.
Got it.
Arash, come on, man.
That's disgusting.
What's new, virgins?
We need to stop, okay?
We're hungry, we're grubby, and this bus smells like rancid bacon.
You got a little eye booger there.
- Where are we?
- We had to make a little stop.
- For the night.
- Korkin, what'd you do now?
It's more like, what am I going to do now?
Right now, I'm facing the greatest challenge of my young life.
Sarah is the daughter of the preacher who founded
Chastity Until Marriage.
We pull this off, we are talking legendary.
- Biblical.
- So where are we?
Getting lucky in Kentucky.
- Where is my Katy's honey?
- Momma Hartman?
There you are, sweetie.
I have missed you so much.
Well, come on off this smelly bus.
I am just so glad that my Katy called and let me know that you boys needed a crash pad.
Everybody grab a shower.
Ladies first.
Go on, go on.
You know where it is.
Go on.
There you go.
In the meantime, I'm gonna figure out something for supper.
What in the world is...
Oh, my gosh.
There's fried chicken with all the fixings, and veggie lasagna for all you poor non-meat eaters, and, Arash, honey, I didn't know what you are, so I made you some enchiladas and some Pad Thai and some Baba Ghanoush.
We eat goat testicles.
Delicious.
- You boys look so spiffy.
- You look spiffy, too.
I am so glad I didn't get rid of Papa Hartman's old clothes.
This is wrong.
This is so wrong.
We were nearby.
I had to improvise.
And by the way, Katy said to give her a ring.
- What?
- You should call her.
May I have everyone's attention?
I wanna show y'all something.
These are my two beautiful oldest daughters, Katrina and Kerry, and their wonderful husbands.
And then this is for my Katy and Andy.
Hopefully someday soon!
Isn't that sweet?
Andy!
Well, this just calls for a toast, doesn't it?
Yes!
Toast.
- To the future happy couple.
- Cheers.
That's so sweet.
Beer pong 101.
- See what happens?
- Ready?
All right.
This is the face-off.
Look into her eyes and be ready.
A toast.
To the ponging of the balls.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Nice!
- Oh, my gosh.
- No, they can judge you.
- No, they can't.
That's not very judgmental.
Is that your thing?
- Yes.
- Here.
She's talking shit about you guys.
She's talking shit.
Okay, so I'm here not hearing from you all day, and you have that asshole Korkin calling me for a place to stay?
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
He stole my phone when I was asleep.
- Impressive.
- Yeah, I know many survival skills.
Yeah, sure.
Andy, why aren't you in Georgia, and what's with the busload of girls?
Well, we had to hitch a ride.
Got a little detoured.
But the Chastity Girls are harmless.
- The Chastity Girls?
- It's a church group, sort of.
- Anyway, I'm in your room.
- Right.
Safe and sound.
Sex without love dooms relationships, because people spend more time screwing than really getting to know each other.
- Nice.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Did I just do that?
- Yes!
Bye.
So then, is sex without love the same thing as premarital sex?
People have different definitions.
So what is yours?
I've never really had the chance to decide.
Most guys don't have the balls to go after a preacher's daughter, despite our reputation for being naughty.
- I got your anniversary present.
- Already?
Yeah, Korkin sent me the link.
In The Buff?
It's all over YouTube.
I can't believe you did that.
Girl, it ain't so tough To sing it in the buff
In the buff!
Korkin!
Andy!
In the buff, in the buff
Half a million people, man.
- It's a top-featured video on YouTube.
- I know.
Now the whole world knows you have no balls.
That's still not funny.
It's never been funny.
Dude, chill.
I'm your promoter, right?
I did my job.
I made you a big star.
Now when Jenna sees Big A,
- your little story will seem legit.
- I don't know about Jenna.
I mean, Katy, she's so amazing.
- She transferred just for me.
- Just see it through.
When you get to Jenna, you'll know what to do.
Remember, this is a vision quest, a rite of passage.
- A road trip.
- A road trip, yes, it is!
Now go away.
Leave me the fuck alone, please.
I'm on a mission here.
It's true, I walked down the streets of Tandoori City,
I look in the monkey eyes, and I say,
"You are right.
There are no virgins here. "
What are the...
Too much caffeine.
Wanna get hot and sticky?
Arash, honey, I found a pair of pants for you.
Thank you, and thank you for the wonderful meal.
It was my pleasure, hon.
But I know your mom could have done it better.
No.
Your Baba Ghanoush surpassed that of my father's finest cooks, and actually, ma'am, I don't have a mother.
My father wouldn't allow me to meet her for fear we would conspire to kill him and assume the throne of Tandoor.
I'm gonna tell you what I used to tell my children every single day.
Your daddy's an asshole.
Now you come here to me.
Come on.
You have got a mama now.
Yes, you do!
- You're my mama.
- Yes, I am your mama.
You're my son.
- Let it out.
Let it out.
- Asshole!
- Yeah.
There you go.
There you go.
- You are the hole in the ass.
- Yeah, that's better.
- Rectal chamber.
- Yeah.
- Dungeon of poo.
I know all about competitive and domineering parents, so if you decide to come to Ithaca, I can help.
Thank you, Kyle.
That's so sweet.
Lydia, let's go.
We're leaving right now!
No, Mother.
I'm staying.
And you know what?
Leave me alone, or I swear to God, I will go to Cornell, and it will cost you a fucking fortune.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Here you go.
Safe trip.
- Right, now you eat something.
- Munchies!
And, Arash, honey, I gave you a little extra helping of Baba Ghanoush.
- You just call me anytime, you hear me?
- Yes.
I wish you birthed me.
I'm sorry for flooding your toilets.
Andrew.
Listen, I don't know what's going on between you and Katy, but just be honest with each other.
Hey.
Okay.
- It was good to see you.
- It was great seeing you.
And I jacked up the front of the bus and cut that hog right out of there.
Well, enjoy your ham sandwiches, everybody.
- Bye!
- See you.
- Bye!
- Bye!
Bye!
Bye!
Okay.
Stay safe.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our final destination.
Prepare to get your pong on!
You throw like a girl!
Two times, you cannot hit even a small target?
- One more strike...
- Jenna!
...and you're out if I'm not in, baby!
So much has changed.
You're now so big and strong.
I'll take over.
Looks like you need a break.
Thanks.
Hurry, come with me.
Hello, everyone.
This is my friend Andy.
You probably have seen a lot of him on the net.
And he is here today especially to perform his new song In The Buff!

Andy!
What do you see?
An amazingly gorgeous girl who once made a really dorky American feel cool before falling out of a hay loft.
So let's see it.
Whoa.
Not too bad for a cadaver.
Hello.
Andy's song inspired me.
Oh, sweet God!
Hello!
But I'm having a little trouble with this bra.
So did I.
Here, you know what, let me help you.
You know what you do when someone has a boo-boo?
Kiss it.
Make it better.
I've dreamed of this so many times.
Were they, how do you say, the water dreams?
Yeah.
Sometimes twice a day.
In the buff
In the buff
Girl, it ain't so tough to sing it in the buff
- Thank you!
- Thank you, my Andy.
Take it off for Andy!
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
It's...
It's complicated.
Perhaps it's better that way, because I must leave, anyway.
You know how I was hoping for the next step on the ladder?
Well, it came.
A big agency saw me for a shoot in Paris.
That's great.
You deserve it.
Yeah.
But always remember, when those crazy model bitches attack...
Don't you crack, don't you crack 'Cause, baby, Big A's got your back
- Big A's got your back
- Big A's got your back
My Andrew.
Whatever happens, your complication is a very lucky girl.
How about some of this?
And then that?
You're gonna go down.
You're going to go downtown.
Take the train.
Yes, you want some?
Here we go.
Yes, here we go!
Step it up.
- Yeah?
- You lied to me, Andy.
You really were freaked out.
So maybe after five years of love, instead of getting in the buff, you should have just told me the truth.
Have fun with your French beer bitch.
Liar.
Korkin?
God...
Dude!
What?
This is becoming a very bad habit.
We gotta leave, man.
Now.
Come on.
You couldn't do it, could you?
No, I could have.
But I didn't.
Then that's why we came here, right?
To find out?
No, no.
You wanted to come here.
I didn't want to come here.
I swear, if you didn't have a boner right now, I'd kick your ass.
It's pretty intimidating, huh?
You know what?
He probably didn't mention that screwing you would be the biggest challenge of his life, did he?
- "Biblical," if I recall correctly.
- Biblical, huh?
- No.
- Let's see about that.
She won't answer any of my calls.
Who?
All right.
I was just checking.
I taught him the Tandoori national anthem.
And we found weed.
We encountered a Tandoori team from Harvard.
And they wanna scrimmage us.
They gave us these glorious fatties to celebrate the imprisonment of Captain Mother Bitch Bag of Douche, my father.
Yeah, and by the way, I finally took a shit.
And get this,
- the weed was gone...
- But where did it go?
...and in its place was a turd in a baggie!
The human body is truly an amazing machine.
- We have to go.
- Yeah.
Ladies and gentlemen, your three-time defending national champion,
Raz-R!
And last but not least, representing the University of Ithaca,
North-East regional champions, Hagan Hall!
What up, Fake?
Ready to be exposed as the burnout, scraggily, Sasquatch-looking fraud you are?
- I will bitchslap the...
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I got nothing, bro.
Sorry.
You got nothing because you are nothing.
Why don't you go back to your dorm where it's safe?
Let the big dog eat!
- Contestants, take your places...
- You ready for this?
- Totally.
I'm fine.
- ... for the Beer Pong Nationals.
Brought to you by Beer Pong America.
And now, round one.
- Oh, my God.
That's amazing.
- Yeah.
I actually invented that trick.
Round two, the quarterfinals.
- Go, go, go, go!
- Go, go, go, go!
Dude, you suck.
You'll never make it.
So close.
Hurricane Jake.
The Pong America Semifinals.
Okay.
How do you do?
You want a piece of this?
- Okay, okay, okay!
- That's not really playing fair, is it?
Don't even...
Taxi!
- Damn.
- Excuse me?
Where's Andy?
The complication.
You're a lucky girl.
He's inside.
Any more weed?
The Tandooris have been smoking since they lost in the first round,
- and now they're completely tapped out.
- That's gonna be a problem.
All right, guys.
This is it.
I want a good clean match, okay?
No contact whatsoever.
Jake, you know what happens when you drink too much.
Lost my high, bro.
I gotta do something.
All right.
Nice, Jake.
No surprises, okay?
It's us against Raz-R and Jabba.
Now, hey, if Jake wins possession, we have to hit every throw 'cause they will not miss.
- I know.
Okay.
- Okay?
Get your shit straight.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Okay?
Okay.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- All right, do your thing.
- Okay.
Katy?
I swear, nothing happened.
- It doesn't matter.
- Okay, okay, something happened.
Something little.
I kissed her
- on the lips and the toes...
- Andy.
...and the whole general foot and ankle area...
Andy, it's okay.
You made a mistake.
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have transferred.
I'm gonna go back to CMU.
And then things can go back to normal?
Our weekly virtual thing?
'Cause I really like the Skype sex.
How about you could just be my hometown guy for a while, and we'll see each other on breaks?
Christmas, summer...
- Hey!
- Hey.
Hey, Katy.
It's good to see you.
Listen, buddy, it's game time.
I know.
Just one minute.
Okay?
- You know what?
Actually, I gotta go.
- No, no, no.
It's the finals.
Please stay.
Look, I really want you here.
Beer Pong America National finalists, take your positions.
- Winner take all.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- And may the best team win.
Tournament rules apply, and the decision of the judge is final.
The winner will be undisputed world champions.
All right.
This is it.
Trick shot for possession.
Peons, plebes and punkass bitches.
Miss it.
Miss it!
- We're fucked.
- Thank you very much.
Bring it, Fake.
What you got?
I'll tell you what I got.
God damn it!
Possession, Raz-R Bax.
Don't worry, boys.
It's gonna be quick and painless.
You.
You and me!
This is ridiculous.
Hey, Raz-R!
Why don't you just take a little peek at that?
- Kiss it.
Love it.
- You want a little piece of that?
Make a wish.
Rub it.
The genie will come out, baby.
Fuck that shit.
- How about that?
You want it?
- You like that?
- You hungry for that?
- Re-rack!
Are you serious?
Golly!
How do you like that, son?
- That's real questionable, buddy.
- Forgot to wipe.
All right.
Don't worry about it, guys.
Let's go!
Let's go, Jake!
Tandoori time!
Ref, time out!
Thirty-second time out, Hagan Hall from Ithaca.
Everybody, gather around.
Let's bow our heads, close our eyes, and let's pray.
You gotta be kidding me.
Are you serious, man?
- It worked for you, didn't it?
- Yeah.
This is a fucking joke.
Bounce it at them.
Finish them off.
Nice stop, Raz-R Bax.
Ball's to Hagan Hall.
Suck it!
Kiss it now, big boy.
Kiss it now.
Ready?
Ready?
All right.
Let's send these bitches home.
You cool?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Shoot, freak.
I'm waiting.
Are you guys seeing this?
It went in!
Yes!
It went in!
Fuck you!
Yeah!
Yeah!
No!
- Hey, Jake.
- Is he out?
He never has to drink this much, man.
He's got zero tolerance.
Fucking amateurs.
Even if you get it in, it's over.
No subs allowed.
He's right.
The rule is, if your partner can't shoot, you forfeit.
Maybe you wanna sing your little swan song first, In The Buff.
Be my guest.
It's all yours.
Hagan Hall, resume play or forfeit.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
- Thought you were with him.
- No.
He was just a distraction.
Raz-R, you're the man.
Wait, what did she just say?
- What did she just say?
- She said I'm the man.
What?
Game over, asshole!
What?
What?
Dude!
Okay, okay, not bad, Katy.
Not bad at all.
I thought you said girlfriends and beer pong don't mix.
- No.
- Welcome to the show, honey.
I thought you said you were just my hometown honey.
We've got to find more weed.
And that's how Ithaca won its first national sports championship.
Wait, well, what happened to everybody?
Well, Andy tried to follow up his You Tube success In The Buff with the Beer Pong Song.
It ended up a one-hit wonder, and his 15 minutes of fame only lasted 15 minutes.
Katy regained her scholarship.
She and Andy hooked up on Thanksgiving and Christmas and summer break, and that time he came home for his great aunt's funeral.
Having met the perfect girl,
Arash returned to Ithaca, got a job and worked his way through college.
But before he could commit, he had to take her home to Kentucky to Momma Hartman's field.
He needed Momma Hartman to teach Sujatmi how to "till it. "
Jake now coaches Ithaca's National Champion Beer Pong Team, and we petitioned to make it an Olympic sport.
And Korkin found the one girl worth being doused with concentrated urine and feces.
Good for him.
And as for me,
I will remain at Ithaca, an ever vigilant PUSE proudly serving our students, until I can get a real job or until my dad dies.
Any questions?
Yeah.
Could you tell me where those lugs hang out?
The End
Hey, Lemur, what's up?
You owe me 10 bucks!
Sorry, guys.
Sorry about that.
So then you're going to walk through it going...
Good morning, Ithaca!
Hey, Lisa, you were supposed to call me!
Call me tonight, all right?
God!
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
You cut off his leg!
Somebody get some help!
I need a tourniquet and some ice.
Okay, don't panic.
Don't panic.
Everything's going to be okay.
I'm a trained first responder, okay?
- Can you hear me?
- I am so fired.
Is he laughing?
- Y'all got punk's!
- What?
Son of a bitch.
Works every time, you.
Thanks, man.
Welcome to the University of Ithaca.
I'm Kyle, your PUSE.
Come on, pervs.
PUSE.
It stands for Prospective Undergraduate Student Envoy.
Come on, people.
Lighten up, it was a joke.
He's fine.
- Take it easy, man.
- You owe me a beer.
See?
We're all about special needs here.
As a matter of fact, our motto is, "If you're special, we needs you. "
So, besides being a PUSE, what do you do at Ithaca, Kyle?
Well, I've been an RA for four years.
I'm currently getting my Ph. D., and I'm the alumni advisor for my frat.
Wow.
Yeah.
What percentage of Ithaca students end up going to Ivy League grad schools?
That's a good question, and I'm not really sure.
Okay, well, am I going to be limited in the number of hours that I can take in a semester, or...
I don't know, but if not, you sure should be.
Can I be both a double major and a double minor?
I really don't know about that, either.
So, what do you know, Mr. PUSE?
That Ithaca is the proud holder of a national athletic championship.
Yeah, no way.
No, this is an academic institution.
I mean, your mascot's a librarian.
- Lydia, stop.
- What?
He's a moron.
I'm sorry.
She's under a lot of stress right now.
It's okay.
- Mom, you're doing it again.
- What?
Doing what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Ryan told me what you did during his campus visit.
- I have no idea what she's talking about.
- Oh, my God.
- You get back here right now, missy!
- Or what?
No, it's cool, she can leave.
Of course, you're going to be missing out on a really great story.
Love.
- Sex.
- Oh, God.
The relentless pursuit of academic excellence.
Fine.
Okay, so, there's this guy named Andy who lives on my floor, right?
And he's been dating this girl named Katy for, like, ever.
They began as high school lab partners in Mr. Blankenbaker's biology class.
Andy helped Katy win the science fair, and Katy became Andy's band manager and biggest fan.
They were in love, whatever that is, and they promised that graduation would only make them stronger.
Though their bodies were separated, their hearts stayed together tight, till the start of their junior year.
After five years of love
This song's just not enough
So I decided I won't be denied and I'll sing it in the buff
In the buff, in the buff
Girl, it isn't so tough
In the buff, in the buff
Girl, it isn't so tough to sing it in the buff
In the buff
Dude!
What the fuck?
Corky, a little help.
My toe's cramping up.
I don't care if you're having fucking seizures.
- That is horrible.
- Corky.
- Did you ever hear of manscaping?
- I need help.
Don't touch me.
I'll be outside.
- Do you actually have testicles?
- Didn't you just see them?
I'm serious, man.
My cousin, his never dropped.
He literally has no balls.
So when he tells me that he can't break up with his girlfriend, I get that.
No, it's not that I can't, Corking.
I don't want to.
I mean, Katy's beautiful.
She's smart.
She's...
Got your balls locked in her Hello Kitty hope chest?
Wait, wait, wait.
What is that shit?
- This, my friend, is known as an ILMAG.
- A what?
An Improvised Last-Minute Anniversary Gift.
Every year I have a reminder set on my computer, but this year, mysteriously, it didn't go off.
You're welcome.
Dude!
Uncool.
Sabotage was my last resort.
You're 21 and you act 40.
- You never go out.
You never party.
- I play beer pong every weekend.
And you go right home after every tournament.
- Know why?
- Why?
Because you fear temptation.
And who fears temptation but a man with doubts?
- Work it, Chloe.
- Bite it, Corking.
Okay, okay, so sometimes I'm tempted.
But overall, I'm a very happy man, okay?
Let me make you happier.
Designate Katy as your back-home girl.
Your hometown honey.
She's there for weekends, vacations, long dry spells.
Let her think whatever she wants, but here, you do whatever you want.
It's a win-win.
- Okay, unlike you, I don't cheat.
- What does that even mean?
It means I don't cheat.
In that bucket is concentrated urine and faces.
Any Hagan Hall man known to have a steady girlfriend gets treed.
Ass Turd will be there till she comes to rescue him.
Guess I better not mention K
- A-T-Y to these guys.
Corking, no.
You don't want to know what else they put in that bucket.
You know, maybe you could have mentioned that before I swapped dorms.
- Please don't swap dorms.
- Katy?
It took me forever to find this one.
- What are you doing here?
- Hi!
Your big tournament's tonight, so I wanted to say happy anniversary and cheer you on in person.
That is so cool.
- I'm not done.
Guess what else?
- What could be better?
I transferred here, to Ithaca!
- Wow!
- Wow!
Better update those hepatitis shots, bro.
There's a storm brewing, boys.
Wind, four knots.
Barometric pressure, falling.
Perfect conditions for Hurricane Jake.
Peonage!
Only his third try, Razz-R.
See you at Nationals.
Eat pussy.
You suck.
As soon as I capture this tape, I can upload it to YouTube.
What about your full ride at CMU?
I mean, it's like the Harvard of horticulture.
Yeah, it's amazing, but so are you.
I mean, we only have one chance to be in college together.
I don't want to waste it.
Didn't you feel like we were slipping away with all the e-mails and Skype sex?
I don't know.
Maybe.
- I freaked you out, didn't I?
- No!
I mean, no, I...
It's going to be great.
Girl, it isn't so tough...
Okay.
...to sing it in the buff
In the buff
There's a storm brewing, boys.
Wind, four knots.
Barometric pressure, falling.
Perfect conditions for Hurricane Jake.
- Somebody looks freaked out.
- I'm not freaked out.
Well, you should be.
She's going to suck you into some off-campus apartment with curtains and coasters and a chaise lounger with those giant fucking pillows.
Kick her ass to the curb before you get doused with concentrated urine and faces.
No woman is worth that.
But right now, both you douche bags need to focus.
We go to war in one hour.
Awesome.
- New uniforms.
- Are you ready to protect this house?
Sexy.
Go away.
Unless you have breasts.
- Hey, guys.
What's up?
- Kyle!
The man!
Dude, you're back!
Yeah, I went to Prague in May on a convention that ended up on a three-month pub crawl where I got laid a lot.
- Very nice.
- By different girls.
Wow.
That's real diversity, Kyle.
- Wait, is the tournament tonight?
- The finals.
You coming?
No, I can't.
I've got a frat meeting.
We're practicing for our new step show.
- What?
- Nice!
Yeah, well, it's better with, like, more black guys, but there's a little taste.
Well, I'm bummed I'm going to miss tonight.
Well, give them hell for Hagan Hall.
You, too, Kyle.
Give them hell, bro.
Glad you're back, man.
- Take it easy, guys.
- Peace.
Peace.
Shit.
It's ready.
Shit.
Razz-R beat us to it.
What?
That's the third trick shot he's uploaded this week.
What up, Jake the Fake?
Just wanted to say good luck tonight, so I can kick your bony ass in Atlanta.
That's right, baby.
Do not let him into your head.
He's already there.
God.
See, there was a time eons ago when beer pong was simply a fringe novelty game played by Cro-Magnons in cave-like garages using paddles.
But the sport, thank you very much, has now evolved into a gruelling mano a mano death match designed to push mind, body and liver to their furthest limits.
Thus the high-tech athletic gear.
Exactly, me lady.
Our bodies are our weapons.
Jake is one of the best trick-shutters in the country.
This right here is like our Olympic trials.
- Hello!
- Well, Godspeed, good sirs, and may you vanquish your many enemies.
- God, that's so lame.
- Corking.
- Right, here you go.
- Thank you.
There's something I forgot to tell you about this place.
- What?
- When somebody puts money in the jar...
It's titty time!
...they flash you.
Welcome to the show, honey.
No, I'm not done yet.
Welcome to the University of Ithaca's Beer Pong Finals, where tonight one of these eight teams will win full sponsorship from Ta Ta's Pub to compete for the National Collegiate Championship!
This is it!
Let's pong it out, bitches!
It's titty time!
- We go eye to eye for possession.
- Okay.
Splash!
We get the balls back for two-hit shots, but we get to keep shooting until one of us misses.
- I'm so glad I'm here.
- I'm not glad you're here.
Hey, buddy, listen.
You shoot.
I'll talk.
Katy, hi.
Girlfriends and beer pong don't mix.
Unless, of course, you can do that.
Nope.
Can't do that.
All right, Ithaca's boys are going to Atlanta next week.
Bounce shots can be blocked, and guys can finger the rim when it's a spinner, but not girls.
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
Yeah!
Girls can blow the hole and it scores as our miss.
Damn it.
Son of a...
Kiki, a drink for our opponents.
I remember.
Now, go do your thing.
She's just a distraction.
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Hey, Lester.
Now check this out.
Andy, you the man!
That's our secret phrase.
Hit a cup in our opponent's hand, and it's...
Death cup.
Game over, asshole.
Yes!
Yes, man!
Yes!
All right, all right, all right!
Who's going to the A-town next week?
Lock and load.
It's titty time!
All right, Ithacans!
This is it, the finals!
We trick-shot for possession.
Come on, Jake.
Did you see that?
Did you see that?
Possession, Hagan Hall!
Hagan!
Hagan!
Hagan!
Hagan Hall.
So do I get to wear your beer pong letterman jacket, you jock stud?
Actually, it wasn't my best night.
Maybe I can change that.
- It's time to celebrate our anniversary.
- How?
See you in an hour.
What's up, guys?
Dude, this is what awaits us at the end of the rainbow, my friend,
- if you get your fucking head straight.
- No way.
- What?
- I knew her before I met Katy.
Her name's Jenna.
She's French.
Bullshit.
So, before Katy, there was Jenna.
She was a total babe.
Sexy.
Exotic.
A real woman among boys, not unlike the lovely lady by my side.
Did I trip you?
I'm sorry.
Such soft, gentle hands.
So, what's your degree in?
- Interpretive Urban Dance.
- It is so hot.
Yeah, so, I'm sorry, you were saying, about the young, hot, exotic Jenna?
Yeah.
Way back before there was ever a Katy,
Jenna was Andy's first crush, his first kiss, and would have even been his first boink, if not for the vicious, man-eating corn snake who called their love nest home.
Jenna's foot recovered nicely with donated replacement tendons from a cadaver.
But once she was loaded into the ambulance,
Andy never heard from her again.
- Bullshit.
- No, I'm serious.
We met at summer camp when I was 16.
- She gave me this bracelet.
- Bullshit.
To prove the lovely Jenna was once his willing near-boink,
Andy logged on to the Pong America web site in an effort to find her.
And Jenna nearly wet her dainty little panties when Andy pinged her, which gave him a virtual hard-on.
She gave me her digits.
Call her.
- I'm going to.
- Okay.
Of course I remember mon Andrew!
Of course she remembers mon Andrew.
I have wondered about you many times.
- She's wondered about me many times.
- Wondered if you're straight?
We actually won our beer pong tournament.
I'm coming to Atlanta next week!
No!
First you must come meet me on the tour!
You can hang out with me and the other girls on the bus!
- Do you want to go?
No?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Okay.
Where are you?
- Tomorrow we are in Illinois.
- I'll meet you in Illinois.
- Where the hell is Illinois?
He's coming to see me.
- Wait.
I can't leave.
- What?
What?
I can't go anywhere.
Katy just transferred here.
Give me her.
Dude, this chick is a world-class hotties, and some snake stole your chance to consummate?
You have to go to her.
Now.
It's a rite of passage, a vision quest.
Vision.
- I can't.
- Okay.
Tell me this.
Is Katy just your first, your first of many, or your first and last?
How should I know?
Then let's go find this goddess, and then if you realize you still want Katy, you'll never have to worry about having doubts again.
You'll know she's the one.
- That was the best week of my life.
- Until now.
- Road trip!
- Road trip!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
The bar gave us tickets to Atlanta.
Who's paying for us to get to Illinois?
We need some chump to sponsor us.
I know a guy.
- Whoa!
- What the hell, Andy?
Really nice.
I'd give you like a five, Katy, maybe six.
- Okay, serious...
- Okay, Corking, that's good.
Why are they outside my door?
We have to go meet another sponsor.
- Now?
- Yeah, I know, but...
But it's our anniversary.
Look, I'll be right back, okay?
And then we'll have all night to celebrate.
- Okay.
- In the buff.
And I wrote a new song for you.
Out.
Now.
That's embarrassing.
- Now!
Right now!
- Corking.
Jake.
- Bye.
- "I wrote a song for you. "
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
His name is Arash.
His dad's the dictator of Tan door.
- Where the hell is Tan door?
- Next to Illinois.
No, it's an island off the coast of Indonesia.
He's loaded.
I took Intro to Modern Drug Cultures with him.
Awesome class.
Changed my life.
- Yes?
- Hey, man.
It's Jake.
I brought some weed.
I'm winning this.
This is the game...
This is the game of real life.
This is not a fantasy.
Welcome to real life.
I hope you like...
I bet you guys kick ass at paintball.
I have the weed.
I don't know...
You're dying.
You're not living anymore.
This is the real life.
Do not fuck with me, Lawdawg54!
I am now owning your ass!
I am the property master and you are my servant!
Yes.
In your face!
That hurts bad.
Go to sleep!
I admired your essay on the socio-political relevance
- of Up in Smoke very much, Jake.
- Thanks, man.
So, tell me, why are you really here?
My friend and I are beer pong players, and we come requesting sponsorship for our team.
- Beer pong?
- Let me demonstrate.
I have seen this.
You Americans can turn even drinking into a contest.
Indeed.
But if we win, your investment will be doubled, and you will bring glory to your father, your country and to Ithaca.
- I will travel with you?
- Probably better if we go it alone.
Keep costs down.
Stay low profile.
I have no need for money, I hate my father, my country is a shit bucket, and Ithaca was my fallback.
Evidently, Harvard does not accept the sons of despots.
Who knew?
Leave me now.
I will keep your hashish in return for my time.
Wait!
You can come, and I'll put us on a busload of gorgeous models.
Look, this girl in the middle, that's the girl I'm going to see.
- Is she a virgin?
- She's all natural, man.
- Except for some tendons in her foot.
- And her private regions?
Jungle bush?
Okay.
If you are lying, you will all be kidnapped and sent to my father's mines, where you will work in complete darkness until you die of the black lung,
filthy, emaciated and cold.
- Works for me.
- No problem.
Yes.
- Then we have a deal.
Yes.
- Yes.
- Here we go.
Okay.
Very good.
- Thank you.
Phone the hanger.
Have them prepare Tan door 2 for a dawn departure.
And make me some soup.
- What is Tan door 2?
- It's the royal jet.
Fuck yeah, it is!
Welcome to the team!
Fuck yeah, it is!
- Hey, what's this?
- Not good.
- Shit.
- Adji!
This is the CIA.
You're surrounded, and we're coming in.
It's him.
He's the terrorist!
Andy, where are you?
It's been, like, three hours.
Please call me back.
Your turn, Jenna.
And no dares for you.
I want the truth.
- Was this Andy guy your first?
- I'm working.
- Yeah, we want to hear the truth, sister.
- Come on, Jenna.
Fine, the answer is no, but almost.
Within one week we were in love.
- So, you guys going to hook up or what?
- I don't hook up.
I'm a lady.
- Who sells beer with her breasts.
- Right.
And then, overwhelmed by the inter-gravitational pull of their mutual hotness, the beer pong girls engaged in a naked pillow fight.
What a bunch of male wish-fulfilment bullshit.
I've never been in a naked pillow fight before.
I have.
Right.
So anyway, our heroes were transported to a secret CIA interrogation centre, where they were interrogated...
No.
No.
That looks like Korkin's mom.
- ... tortured...
- This is a bad trip.
I'm tripping out, man!
- Hey, man.
- ... and humiliated.
- You don't need to do it.
- Open wide for mommy!
What the fuck is that?
No, no, no, no, no.
Back up.
Back up.
Turns out papa tyrant was overthrown in a coup.
All of his assets were seized and given to the poor, hungry people of Tan door.
Greedy bastards.
I thought my dad was bad, but apparently some despotic parents can never be pleased.
Okay, it's safe.
My dick hole is the size of a garden hose, you son of a bitch!
So sorry.
Okay, okay, all right.
Allow me to apologize to you all.
I had no idea my father would be overthrown by a group of 12 unarmed peasants and a wizard.
I am now destitute, penniless, homeless.
- Welcome to America.
- Corking, it's not his fault.
We're lucky they let us go.
Let's just find out where we are.
"Bethesda"?
- That's bullshit, man.
- Maryland?
It's like, there should be a fucking law that the fucking CIA has to fucking drop you off where they fucking got you!
- So write your fucking congressman!
- You know what?
Eat my ass, Corking, 'cause I had to swallow a whole pound of weed, and then they made me listen to techno all night.
You know what that's like?
Guys!
Okay, you know what?
Shut up and let's focus on getting out of here.
Oh, shit.
- Hello?
- Andy, where are you?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
You won't believe what happened.
Thank you.
Jake, follow me.
Ass-rash, thanks for nothing, and I'll see you never.
No, no, no, no, wait, wait, you can't leave me here.
His dad is the dictator of Tan door, right?
The dictator of Tan door?
If I am found by rebel agents, I will be brutally tortured and fed to goats.
That's not my problem, shithead.
We need a sponsor, not some assassination target.
For the first time in my life, I have no guards, no father.
- I am finally free.
- All right, I have an idea.
- Please don't leave me here, Corking.
- Play along, or you're goat food.
- Take that.
- Okay.
Follow me.
He was going to fly us to Atlanta on Tan door 2, his own private jet.
You want me to believe that you stood me up on our anniversary so you could ride on some dictator's airplane?
My phone's dying, Ass-rash, so hurry up.
Take some bags, head to the van in the front.
Do you see keys?
- Yes.
- Okay, put the luggage in the back.
Wait!
Turn right.
The cabbies are staring at you.
Flip them off.
No, flip them off!
Flip them off!
No, not me, moron.
Them.
Do it!
My uncle was a cabbie!
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off!
They had helicopters and they had laser-sight guns, and then we were thrown into this helicopter...
- Hit it!
- Hit what?
- Go!
- What, drive?
- Awesome!
- You can't drive?
I was never allowed to, but I am most excellent at Super Mario Kart.
Corking had, like, this penile pap smear, Jake was tortured by bad music.
And let me guess, you were water boarded?
No, that was Arash.
Need a ride?
Get in!
- No!
No, no, no, you didn't.
- Come on!
- Okie dokie.
- Come on.
Like that.
It was totally crazy.
Okay.
So, how does this ridiculous farce contribute to my decision to come here?
Because it speaks to the spirit of our students.
I became the man I am today because of a road trip.
- I love a good ride.
- Mom.
- I still like to roll every once in a while.
- Mom!
Okay.
TMI.
Come in.
- Katy Hartman?
- Yeah.
- Andy's Katy?
- Yeah.
Cool.
I'm Kyle, your RA.
You know, Andy and I are pretty good friends.
We even compared penises in the shower once, and he totally regretted it.
So this is Amy.
Amy had a little altercation with her former Sigma Gamma roommate and had to be relocated.
I think you guys are going to be a good match.
Hey!
How's my favourite glamorous supermodel?
Very glamorous, mon amour.
Runway.
Bright lights.
Wait, I send you a photo.
- Mandee?
- Okay.
Smile!
That looks like a fun job.
Good resume builder.
Okay.
So wait.
So you transferred from your dream school, the Columbia of cultivation, to be here for some guy?
I missed him, and I wanted to be with him.
And now there's a nail in that man's head because he bounced the same day you showed up?
We'll get through it, and I'll just stay busy until he gets back.
What?
Baking cookies?
Doing his ironing?
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying.
Look here, Amy,
I don't care how many sorority girls you've punched.
Just because I don't have purple eye shadow and spiky hair doesn't mean I'm not a strong, independent woman, okay?
I just panicked, all right?
And now I'm here and he's there, and, frankly, I'm a little freaked out.
Okay.
Look, I'm having a party tonight, all right?
Just some ladies hanging out, having a good time.
I think you should come.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Do you remember the song you wrote for me?
When the bitches attack Don't you cry, don't you cry
Because, baby, Big A's got your back
Big A's got your back
God.
- Wow, I kind of forgot that one.
- But you still have a record deal, no?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sure.
I just recorded a new song yesterday, actually.
- In my studio.
- What?
Yeah, sure he did.
We have a stage on the tour.
You can play a concert when you arrive.
Actually, we got a little sidetracked, so we won't be able to make it today, but I'll meet you at your next stop in Nashville for sure.
I must now enter the glamorous beer pong dunking booth.
Au revoir, my wittle French fry.
- I'm going to fucking puke.
- I, too, am in need of a restroom.
- Again?
- What are you, a chick?
Nudie bar!
Pull in there.
You can potty while we party.
My people are known to have diminutive bladders.
To go with your diminutive wittle weewees?
Is that your record studio, Big A?
Got to go.
Got to go.
Got to go.
- Hey.
- Andy!
Boys, give it up for Bambi!
Bambi enjoys early bird specials, cuddling up with a nice box of wine, and watching reruns of Matlock!
- Shit.
Left my wallet in the car.
- Yeah, me, too.
Welcome to the Kit 'N Cougar, fellas.
Actually, we just came so my friend could take a piss.
So you want to use my plumbing, but you can't patronize my business?
No, of course not.
Don't be rude, Jake.
Let's party.
After last night and then this morning I was totally freaking out, but my new roommate is so sweet.
She invited me to her party tonight, and I decided to go with her.
Good for you.
That's great.
Don't fight it, boys.
You'll never get her out of your mind.
You think our cougar's hot, you got to see our kittens.
The kitten?
Show me a little pussy.
Watch your language, boy.
This is a classy establishment.
Yes, sir.
No problem, sir.
Arash, get the fuck over here.
I mean, I can't believe it!
This campus is really gorgeous.
And I found this cute little coffee shop where we can study by the fire together when it's snowing.
Dude, if one of the Golden Girls tries to give me a lap dance,
I swear to God, I am going to puke.
Hi, guys.
You like the twins?
- They're sisters?
- Fraternal.
I'm their ma, and Bambi dancing out there, well, she's my ma.
And Lester, that teddy bear that brought you all in, well, he's my hubby.
It's a family business.
Then momma, come to daddy.
Mangoes.
There are these adorable little apartments off campus.
We can totally move in together next year.
I like you.
I have to go.
- Watch the hands, Mowgli.
- Okay.
There's even a spare room for my mom, when she comes to visit.
She'll totally cook and clean.
You know her!
I'll make us some curtains, and we can buy our own furniture.
I've always wanted one of those chaise loungers with the big, fluffy pillows.
- Katy?
Katy?
- This is going to be so great for us.
I thought you were mad at me.
Well, I was, until I read about the coup in Tan door.
How's Arash?
Poor little guy.
Oh, my God.
That's disgusting!
Carrie, I told you that could happen.
Now be professional, sug.
Mom, he peed on me.
Lester, code red!
Golden shower in the champagne room!
- You have a napkin?
- He's fine.
We found a ride and we're headed to the tournament.
That's awesome.
Well, I have to jet to registration, but have fun, okay?
Love you.
Bye.
- Corking!
- What?
He pissed on my baby girl!
- Get them!
- Oh, shit!
Get the fuck in the cab!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
They both had the same exact little mole above their butt cracks.
Never have I seen six more perfectly diverse breasts.
And now, thanks to Ass-rash and his girlie bladder, that memory will forever be a painful one, because my already swollen dick is now chaffed from sprinting full speed with a fucking boner!
- Yeah!
- Come on, man.
No hitchhikers.
Not a hitchhiker, a fare.
This is a taxi and we need some money.
Plus, do you see that ass?
Hi!
Need a ride?
You can share a fare with these guys.
Hi.
So where you heading?
- Just down the road.
- That's cool.
But I wouldn't go too far down the road in a stolen cab.
Not too hard to spot, you know.
Come on, guys.
DC plate, the meter's not running, and your cabbie's sitting in the back in girlie pink pyjamas 'cause he pissed his pants.
- Interesting ensemble yourself.
- I know, right?
I got this off a Dr. Ratchet.
No way was I going to run cross-country in high heels.
Shit!
My stomach, man.
What's his deal?
He swallowed a bag of marijuana before we were detained by the CIA.
I fucking hate those guys, man!
Seriously.
They have been spying on me ever since I got back.
- Back from where?
- I can't say.
They're listening.
God!
- Pull over, man.
It's bad.
- Right there.
I have to dump this load somewhere.
- Not in the car.
- Here's a convenience store.
- Convenient?
Do they sell trousers?
- Lf you had any money.
- Who wants grub?
- I do.
- I do.
- No.
No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
- My stomach is hollow.
It's hollow.
- No one cares.
- No, we're broke.
- No worries.
I'll buy.
Corking, that woman clearly just escaped from somewhere not good.
That's why we get the food and then ditch her ass.
Go tell Jake the plan.
Let me handle this.
Okay?
Hey, hey.
Thanks, buddy.
Hey, you guys, grab a basket, get anything you want.
- Sweet.
- See you tomorrow.
Hey, Jake, it's me.
Let's go.
Kory's going to ditch her as soon as she buys us food.
Yeah, Andy.
Why don't I just lube my hands so I can shove it up my ass and remove the bag of ganja lodged in my rectum?
- Hey, handsome.
- Hey.
We're going to take all of this,
- and everything you got in the register.
- Hello!
Come on.
Come on.
- All right.
Don't shoot.
- Move.
- Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
- Stop pressuring me!
- Hurry up.
Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.
Come on.
Let's go.
Keys, please.
Come on, come on.
Thanks.
You guys might want to hit the floor right about now.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay, then.
You bitches stay on the floor.
Your ho is going to die.
Back door!
Hey, Jake, back door.
Come on!
Go, go, go, go!
- You okay?
- Shit.
- Thought you took care of that.
- Fucker never came out.
Pretty sure the baggie burst, though.
- No signal.
- Who are you calling?
I don't know, man. 911?
We need some help.
What are you going to tell them?
Our stolen taxi got stolen?
- Wait, you have a better idea?
- No.
Not yet, but I'm not a quitter.
I'm finishing this thing.
Finishing what, Corking?
You don't even play beer pong.
We're in deep shit here, man, and it's all your fault, so you better start praying we get out of this somehow.
You want me to pray?
You want me to pray?
Fine!
Here I am praying that Jake can squeeze a fucking pot brownie
- from his rectum.
- Please, God.
Here I am praying that Arash isn't devoured by goats.
Here I am praying that the aliens return Andy's balls, so he can be a man and dump his lame-ass girlfriend!
Here I am praying for a miraculous rescue before the cops take us all to jail!
Amen!
Is that good enough for you?
You guys okay?
Wow.
Wow.
No.
We're not, actually.
We're in big trouble.
Would you believe our van got stolen?
That sucks.
Were you just at the retreat?
Why, yes!
Yes, we were at the retreat.
We were retreating.
But now we're here, alone in the wilderness, all by ourselves.
Well, we could give you guys a ride to the next town, I guess.
That would be mighty kind.
We're headed to Nashville.
We're from Arkansas.
We go right through there.
Thank God you stopped.
Well, you see four guys praying by the side of the road, and you kind of feel obligated, you know?
Hello.
Is your friend okay?
I'm fine.
Much better now.
I can totally hear myself blink.
Think.
- So, do you guys want to go to the cops?
- No.
- Yeah, that car sucked, anyway.
- Yeah, it's insured.
- So, what's next?
- Party, dumbass.
Jake's baggie burst.
He's stoned and happy.
Even Ass-rash here might get laid.
Nobody's getting laid.
Hate to tell you this, but this is a church retreat about chastity.
- What the hell is chastity?
- Abstinence from sexual intercourse.
What?
- Abstinence from sexual intercourse.
- No sex until marriage.
Well, that's fucking perfect.
I'm a devout heathen, you're going to cheat on your girlfriend with a beer pong model, Jake's stoned out of his fucking gourd, and Ass-rash here is a Muslim.
- I am Hindu, asshole.
- Is there a difference?
And if you call me Ass-rash again, I will rip off your arm and I will bitchslap you with your own hand.
Just a joke, man.
No need to go all third world on me.
Wow, is that your van?
- Let go!
- Wow.
- No.
No.
- No.
- That one's a taxi.
- No.
- Ready?
Okay.
- Okay, you got this.
- I got this.
- All right.
- My name's Sarah.
- Corking.
- What's your first name?
- People call me Corking.
So, Sarah, have you ever been tempted to break the chastity code?
I sure have.
Well, Corking, my father, people call him Reverend.
He founded the Chastity Movement.
So, does that answer your question?
Yeah.
Guess so.
Good.
Now I've got one for you.
What's the deal?
I saw you duck when we passed the cops.
Okay.
Okay.
I like you, so I'm going to do something here that I never really do, ever,
- and tell the truth.
- You better, or you're going to be finding another ride.
We weren't at any retreat.
No.
Andy and Jake are actually beer pong players from the University of Ithaca, and technically I'm their manager, but really I just tag along to cause trouble.
We're trying to get to Atlanta for Nationals, but we've got to go through Nashville first so that Andy can hook up with a beer pong model.
And our stolen van...
I mean, our van was stolen by that chick after she robbed a store and got us shot at.
That's it.
So will you take us?
To Nashville or Atlanta?
Both?
Road trip?
- Road trip!
- Road trip!
- Yes!
- Yeah.
What?
Come on.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I just feel a little out of place.
Girl, please, chill out.
Here.
Have some fun.
I mean, these girls are all really, really close.
That's pretty close.
So what I didn't tell you is, we're all LUGs.
- You're what?
- Lesbians Until Graduation.
Okay.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now, but I'm pretty sure that I'm still straight.
Yeah, okay.
That's what I said my first time, too.
- Andrew.
- Hey, Jenna.
So, we're on the road.
Did you find another bus full of models to play with?
Yeah, but they only do corn hole tournaments.
You Americans and your corn.
Anyway, my friends, they start to think you are my fantasy.
- Well, I am, right?
Your fantasy?
- Of course, mon amour.
Since our last kiss that tragic day, you have been my one thought, my one breath, my one dream.
No pregnancy.
No VD, and let me just say, women know how to love other women.
That's the LUG life, baby.
Yeah, I bet the initiation ceremony is a whole lot of fun.
So, are you seeing anyone?
Other then drunk college boys with beer breath and bad hair?
No.
And you?
With your music career, you must meet many beautiful women.
Totally, all the time.
I mean, too many to choose from, really.
It's crazy.
How nice of you to fit me into your busy schedule, monsieur Casanova.
Well, we do have some unfinished business,
- if I recall correctly.
- Indeed we do.
Indeed we do.
I'm not saying you got to LUG it out.
I mean, how long has it been since you haven't had a boyfriend?
- Since about the sixth grade.
- Girl, please.
How you supposed to be sure about this guy unless you look around?
And how do you know he's not doing the same damn thing while he's out on his mysterious little trip?
Thank you for using Auto Service System.
My name is Sujatmi.
How may I help you?
Sujatmi is a lovely name.
My name is Arash.
I'm from Tan door.
Oh, my God!
- Sujatmi, I'm so lonely.
- Arash, that is so sad.
Sujatmi, I have not spoken with a Tandoori female in many, many a moon.
That is a long time, Arash.
Is this a dream?
Is this reality?
No, this is all a fantasy.
- Okay.
